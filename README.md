# Scraping Kickstarter website using BeautifulSoup python package

*Creator of the project

*URL

*Project backers

*Days remaining before the projects end date 

*Short discription of project

*About Discription page

*Backers' Pledge contribution

*Project Goal

*Commments

have included two main codes.
