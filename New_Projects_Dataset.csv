0,"Meet SmartibotThe world’s first Artificial Intelligence enabled cardboard robot that you build yourself.Smartibot works with your smartphone, meaning you can use your mobile as a remote control, or by attaching it to your robot, as it’s brain.  The Smartibot app contains a powerful A.I. called YOLO which can recognise objects Smartibot sees such as people, cars, dogs and bicycles. Without any programming you can tell your robot to follow you around with a cup of tea, chase your dog or your cat out of your bedroom or even follow your toy car.As well as the A.I. robot, Smartibot comes with cardboard parts to make two additional robots!  Teabot - Which can deliver your tea, G&T, or anything else you desire  Unicorn - It's a freakin' Unicorn!!! (yeah we are excited too)With Smartibot you can keep on building. You can build your robots out of almost anything around the house, even a potato!You just re-use the circuit board, motors and battery box and attach them to your magnificent creation. The only limit is your imagination.We’ve designed Smartibot to enable you to build robots that are as complex as you want. What does this mean? You can connect up to 14 motors (4 DC ones and 10 servos) so you can build wheeled robots, two legged robots, four legged robots, robot arms, not to mention cars, trikes, hovercraft, airboats, probably even aeroplanes (though we’ve not tried that yet but excited to see what you come up with!).With all this flexibility in how you build your robots, we want to give you flexibility in how you control them. The app allows you to design custom controllers to suit your robot and define how your robot behaves without needing to write any code. Built a robot tank and need a tank controller? Or want to build a band and make a robot Xylophone which requires eight buttons? How about a robot water pistol turret and a single giant fire button? You’ll be able to design all of these inside the app, just by dropping the control elements on the screen and choosing what motors they control. Easy!You can also use the app to control your creations using the A.I. just select what types of objects you want it to look out for and start it up! Smartibot runs on 4 AA batteries, just like most of your electric toys. This means you can open them up, connect Smartibot to their motors and control them from your phone, or make them programmable. This doesn’t just apply to toys. Smartibot can control anything that runs on 4 or fewer AA batteries if you are prepared to get busy with some wire cutters and a screw driver.Smartibot is also compatible with most Radio Controlled model kits! Just swap it for your R/C receiver and drive your model from your phone, or attach your phone and make your model self-driving.Don’t worry we’ve got you. We have designed Smartibot so you can do as much as possible without needing to write any code - but it wouldn’t be much of a robot kit if it wasn’t programmable! We are working with Microsoft to onboard Smartibot to the MakeCode platform, the same programming environment that is used to program the BBC Micro:bit (and taught in thousands of schools). With MakeCode you’ll be able to program your Smartibot using a visual (Scratch-like) blocks editor or with JavaScript. If you're into Micro:bit Smartibot supports Micro:bit Radio so they can talk to one another and you can build them into your projects as one. We’ve created two expansion boards so far:A gorgeous, super-bright, 144 LED display that you can use to add changeable faces or graphics to your robot, to play games, or anything else that needs a whole load of twinkling white lights. andA board with two laser distance sensors and a gesture sensor that you can use make your robot avoid obstacles, prevent it driving off the table, control it with gestures, or anything else that need insanely capable digital sensors.We’ve got loads more expansion boards in the pipeline, from sensors for line following to a microphone and speaker to add sound to your robots.Ever since I shipped the Crafty Robots to our 1,600 wonderful members of the Kickstarter Community (on time!) I’ve wanted to create a robot that embodied the same fun and creativity ethos but took advantage of the latest technology to be truly smart.Whilst participating in the British Council’s ‘Hello Shenzhen’ exchange program I met Janek in Litchee Lab, a Shenzhen makerspace. We both agreed robot building was more difficult, expensive and less fun than it needed to be and we started designing the robot kit of our dreams.When we realised that smart electronics needed equally smart mobile software we brought in Akram, with whom I’ve built apps, that are used everywhere from roadworks sites to rehabilitation clinics to sensory rooms, for our commercial clients. Another random meeting in Machines Room, a makerspace in London, brought Rehana on board who has helped create all the amazing demos on this page.15 months after Janek and I started designing robot kit of our dreams, and hundreds of cardboard robot prototypes later, the Smartibot is finally here and even smarter and more fun than we had dared hope.To keep the cost of Smartibot as low as possible need to buy the components in high volumes and to build the circuit boards with the bluetooth chip and antenna built in. This means we need to put them through certification. We also need to make dies to cut out the cardboard parts and run them on a packaging line. Finally we need to finish off the app and set up the MakeCode integration. To cover all of these upfront costs we need to make the first run of Smartibots quite big, which is why we’ve come to Kickstarter. We really need your help to get Smartibots out into the world.Janek Mann - Originally from Germany but now based in Shenzhen in China, Janek is a highly experienced hardware engineer and researcher with a specialism in wirelessly connected embedded systems. Janek is an enthusiastic contributor to the Shenzhen maker scene and, having designed hardware that is already used by educators, is excited to have created a tool that will hopefully help makers all over the world. 	
Rehana Al-Soltane - Rehana combines a background in Psychology and Pedagogical Science with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and a passion for making. She is also fluent in four languages and is the fastest learner anyone at Machines Room has ever seen.Akram Hussein -  Akram is a London-based software engineer who has written code for everything from Dyson’s robot vacuum cleaner to apps used in healthcare, music, construction and special needs education. Akram is part of the ‘FIx Team’ in the BBC’s flagship technology program ‘The Big Life Fix’ where leading inventors build one off pieces of technology to solve problems for disabled people.Ross Atkin - Ross is a product designer, engineer and researcher with extensive experience designing and building connected products for major manufacturing companies. His work focuses mainly on assistive technology and physical accessibility and, along with Akram, he is a member of BBC’s ‘The Big Life Fix’ ‘Fix Team’. Ross feels very lucky to have such a talented team helping him make and deliver Smartibot.We will ship Smartibots in October and November of 2018 so backers receive them in time for Christmas.This project would not have been possible without the help of some amazingly talented and generous people. Janek, Rehana and Akram all brought their incredible skills to create something amazing. Ala Pytlewska dusted it with some extra visual magic and Claire Poulter and Alice Russell captured that, plus all the fun we had, on video. Bibi Nelson, Dylan Bahnan, Mark Dale, Hilary Kalmbach, sin chi Wan, Bradley Ottaway, Martha Bogert and the crew at Wild and Wooly agreed to participate in some very strange sounding activities and produced robots that totally exceeded my expectations of how awesome they could possibly be.This project would never have started without the British Council’s 'Hello Shenzhen' exchange program, organised by Liz Corbyn and Marc Barto. It’s also benefited hugely from the support of Nat Hunter, Kristin Luke, Gareth Owen-Lloyd, and Mark Dale at Machines Room, as well as the advice and assistance of Helen Steer, Julian Vaissières and the rest of the Machines Room community. You probably wouldn’t have found out about it without Heather Delaney.The project has benefited from a huge amount of really useful advice and input from too many very smart and generous people to name here, plus the astonishing patience and support of my wife Isabel.The music in the video is by Steve Combs and Loyalty Freak Music.If you would like to cover Smatribot you can find a Press Pack here and we would be delighted to answer any of your questions.",Ross Atkin,"£48,406","All or nothing.

Then I'll be able to probably get all of them after the kick starter.~  'Big Life Fix' - best programme ever for teaching Computer Science/Design Tech.  Love it.  The BBC need to commission more like this to help increase STEM engagment in schools.  You rock.~  https://www.youtube.com/watch…~  Did I just see Ross on a trailer for a BBC show called Inventing the impossible????!~  will LED matrix be available for add on?  I really want it but I won't have the money to up my pledge until after the kick starter is closed. I would really like to be able to purchase this....thanks~  @RossThanks for the reply. Bummer... I really wanted to get the sensor board. How much will it go for after KS? The same or higher?~  Hello?! *taptaptap* is this thing on?! XD~  I guess that is a no?~  Is there any way we can purchase the distance/gesture sensor by itself, or even in a pack of 2+? I really have no use for the LED matrix, thus why I did not upgrade to that bundle. It would have just been a waste of money for me, but I would love to get a few of the sensor boards.~  @Creator~  Is it possible to connect 2 or more sensors to 1 circuit board?~  Is it possible to connect 2 or more circuit boards to 1 mobile phone?~  Hope Smartibot join MakeCode before KickStarter project end.~  Thanks~  Thanks for answering!~  Another question: Can i add to the Basicpack (and the 2x Basicpack) the Matrixboard and the Sensorboard too by adding 25 £?~  And another question: ~  Maybe i would like to programming a cat search robot :DHe should work in a previously defined area (one square meter or a half) detect the moving hairy thing when its in the area, starting noises and moving two servos (the hands from the Robot) Or a paperballgun or something :D ~  Is this only possible with a smartphone on it or is the gesture sensor board which detects moving things enough? ~  Cant wait for programming this :D~  Hi there!~  OMG! I love robots :) ~  How can i add some servos? I dont need them now but maybe in the future :P ~  Greetings!~  Any chance of programming this with the Arduino IDE  (?) I know that Adafruit has a board core for the Micro:BIT which works quite well - thou a it is a little picky to setup the first time. https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MicrobitI really like the hardware you have produced, but I don't like the programming environment at all.  I'm not sure how hard it would be to port/chance what Adafruit has done, but it might be worth a look for some of us advance users or for people who don't like the programming environment.~  What is the difficulty with setting up your robot for someone with no experience at all? Could you briefly elaborate on the setup. Also does the app work with android users? Thank you!~  Will there be different languages for the software ? I would give this as a present to a child but that could be a problem when it comes to English :)~  Also would love some more info on the distance/gesture board and what can be done with it.~  Is there any more information on the distance/gesture board? I'm interested, but I'm not entirely sold since the jump from the Super Early Bird pledge to the Early Bird Genius Kit pledge is £28.~  Well my three daughters should have a ball with that they loved their £5 robots~  Awesome work, Ross and team! Looking forward to seeing Smartibot in action.~  What are the minimal requirements for the app?Rather than putting my iPhone X on a moving thing (which is a scary idea)I want to know if I can use my old 5s (which doesn't have AI chips) for this.Thx~  This is great!  Perfect Christmas present.  I added £ 25 to my pledge for the Precious kit to get the LED/sensor board per your earlier response to a comment...is that ok?~  This looks fantastic! I can’t wait to start 3D printing bodies for it!~  This project rocks! Can’t wait to play 💖💖💖~  Besides, the description of each team members are interesting. *thumbs up*~  Can you elaborate about the Precious Kit? Why there is no exclusive cloth patch for the Precious Kit?~  Also backed before I even watched the video, keep up the brilliant work you good, good people!~  Coding interface looks similar to that of the microbits, which would be amazing, my kids have found the limit of those so a new challenge is certainly appreciated!~  Backed without blinking. Genius kit because of the display and all. No (super) early bird surprises there either? In it for the bots so happy regardless. :)~  Wow. This sounds like an awesome base for my STEM class at school. ~  I’ve backed the Precious level for testing but can you tell me if I will be able to add the display and sensor as extras at the end?~  Also can we add the patch to this level :-) ??~  ",9,"£10,000",Smartibot: The world's first A.I. enabled cardboard robot by Ross Atkin — Kickstarter
1,"We have wanted to make a robot for robot wars since the original series back in the 90s. since the reboot of the series and the abundance of cheap easy to use parts and electronics it could actually happen! with your help of course because like all things if you are going to build it, you might as well make it look good and do something different. Even with the subsequent axing of Robot Wars again, we have not been deterred we will make the robot so that it falls under FRA (Fighting robots Association) guidelines. One way or another we will get this robot into an arena and watch it get smashed to bits, with onlookers thinking ""I wonder why they thought that was a good idea""After a few brain storming sessions the idea of a sphere robot, Grant was not sold on the idea as he could see more issues than solutions, but after a few drawings and 3d mock ups there was the very much needed eureka moment where we looked at the models and thought ""it. just . might work.""so if you had a look at the images you will have seen images a few things might have stood out to you, but if not let me explain the design.The sphere has two semi spheres which will be connected to internal wheels which are in turn ran using small motors (type of motor is dependant on weight, RPM and torque needed) at the bottom of the sphere is a counterweight which helps keep the robot upright. on this are the battery which help keep them stable and keeps the center of gravity low to aid the stability of the bot.The weapon system is a circular saw style system where we have a ring bracket which is mounted off center so that the blades extrude out the front, back and top but is safely stored at the bottom so that it does not cut up the floor or interfere with the drive of the bot.Now like most weapon systems if its worth doing, its worth over doing, so if you have looked at the 3d models you may have noticed the big blob of an engine in the middle of the bot, no awards to anyone who guesses what that is for. For anyone who is confused let me explain, that is a 2 stroke engine which will run the weapon system. we wanted to do this mainly for style points rather than any practical reason. that being said there are many pros to using an petrol engine over an electric one, the cons are nonetheless apparent. Mainly weight, having to deal with exhausts and robustness i.e how well can it handle being knocked about.As you may have noticed we are not making this to be the best most deadly robot to ever grace the wars, we want to do this because its different and hard. there are problems we will need to over come but nothing of note was ever discovered by taking the easiest option!You never know we might take the competitions by storm and make it all the way!",Grant,£56,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sat, July 21 2018 9:35 PM UTC +00:00","A BB-8 style battle robot for robot wars, We have wanted to make a robot for Robot wars but we wanted to make something unique.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,4, ,0,£300,Proelium Sphaera by Grant — Kickstarter
2,"So, after many hours of looking for a great way to teach students about 3D printing, programming, designing, hand assembly skills and learning as much as possible about motors, sensors, display, etc I checked out biped robots on the web.  I quickly realised that were some very creative designs out there - kudo's to those designers. However, I did not find one that did everything I wanted and one which would include all teaching features in one package, so....being an engineer I designed one.  As you can see this is a Bob derivative but with many design changes that are somewhat unique to this type of simple BiPed robot style.  I wanted my robot to be a stepping stone to larger robots/projects so the motion system is like many modern biped robots, by adding 7 DOF and a multitude of peripherals students/builders get to work with a lot of features: servo's, gyro, display, MP3, IR communications, Wifi, serial communications, SD card interface, LED control and AI programming skills.  All components can be used for further projects.  I hope you enjoy this project as much as I have designing, building it and hopefully working with many of you to develop it further.I have working prototypes as you can see from pictures and videos. These have been built/tested using standard Arduino boards and interface modules. My custom control card is designed and under final assembly/test,  I will post pictures shortly during campaign.  All manufacturing is done at T4E's facility in the USA. Sensory/Input/Output Features:Control Electronics Features:Simple construction.Consisting of  thirteen (13) 3D printed parts, easily printed on most 3D printers. Each component has been designed for strength and durability but not at the expense of excessive infill percentages, supports and other hard to print features.All parts can be printed at once on a 12 x 12 inch printer (CR10 and alike) but also smaller printers can easily be used.  Close tolerances in design have made for a very sturdy, tight design - all parts will fit perfectly together.T4E has 7DOF all of which can be easily programmed and controlled.  Each DOF is under servo control as directed by the control board. A forth (4) pin/wire can also be used (we supply modified servo's) that allow reading of the actual position of the servo output  - feedback. This is used for tactile sensing - more on this below.  By using a 7.4Volt DC LiPo supply through a buck/boost switch mode regulator, common problems with servo control boards are eliminated. The regulator switches to 6 volts output (user adjustable) even if the input voltage drops below 6 volts (boost), this allows for standard 4.8 Nicad/Dry cell batteries to be used.  The control board processing/sensory circuits have their own, stable, glitch free regulation system. By using 6 volts DC to drive the servo's, maximum speed and power is achieved.Feet details:Each foot is controlled by a servo +/- 90 degrees of movement. By moving the foot pivot point inboard stability can be achieved to nearly vertical position of each leg as can be seen below.Leg details:The leg's on T4E are also jointed like humans - front/back movement rather than top/circular motion about hip point +/- 45 degrees. This has the advantage of more realistic , advanced movements.Arm/Hand details:Each arm is controlled by a servo +/- 90 degree of movement. At the end of each arm is a removable hand/gripper. The control board can read what hand/gripper is attached, this can be used for programming and T4E operations.<pic of hand sensory unit>Head details:The head is controlled by a servo +/- 45 degrees of movement. All cables from the lower body run through the neck joint to the upper control board located inside the head. The head contains:Tactile Sensing:By modifying the servo, a feedback mechanism is available (4-wires from each servo plug directly into control board). This can be used to record/play movement sequences without crunching the gears of the servo's. When a DOF joint (servo) is moved by hand pressure, the control board immediately senses the slight movement and drives the servo in the desired direction to compensate/neutralise the movement. Thus when in this record mode, the DOF joints have zero resistanceProgramming:T4E BiPed Robot uses our custom designed real-time-operating system to ensure smooth, fast, glitch-free operation.  The internal SD card provides virtually unlimited movement storage, AI data and general control/operations programs.  All movements are stored on the SD card which means that if two or more T4E's get together they can exchange moves with each other via the InfraRed communications port - they can start to dance together!Since Arduino based you can develop your own programs using our RTOS and libraries or simply write your own code.  However, T4E BiPed robot is ready to rock and roll without any programming.  Remember too that our control board can be used in any robotic project - boards are available separately.Another cool way to program is by using a bar code reader. T4E BiPed Robot has an interface for this so you can simply swipe away. Bar Coding sheets will be available from our website but you can write your own.Movement language (ML):T4E BiPed Robot has a simple yet sophisticated movement language. Primitive moves such as raise leg and foot together can be saved as a macro, then called/combined with other macros to create sophisticated movements.  T4E BiPed robot has an internal movement clock that is used to synchronize all movements in a particular sequence. Any number of DOF's can move at the same time, at different speeds and different positions.  Movement files/macros are stored on SD card. Note, at this time, audio files are stored on separate MP3 SD card so only movement files can be transferred from one robot to another through Infrared link. Audio files have to be copied by removing SD card from MP3 player and using a PC or similar to manually copy these files (future design will have single MP3/movement SD card).Auto-detect function (ADF):By using our special auto-detect system, simply plug in different hands/grippers and T4E will perform based on what was attached. Thus, if you plug in a microphone attachment, T4E will start to sing and dance. If you plug in a book, T4E will read a story. We have many attachments that will automatically perform a function but you can create your own!<picture of auto detect connection>Each arm has an ADF input and others are located on T4E Biped Robot head and body. For example, you could place a wizard book in one hand, a wand in the other, a scarf around head and T4E will read perhaps some Harry Potter or other such things. This is great feature for younger children who just want to play and have fun or great for advertising products - different item plays different advertisement jingle etc.Our T4E control card has some outstanding features all packed into 2.4"" x 2.4"".  This board can be used for many projects other than this robot. Servo Control with feedback:Most robot control board have only 3-wire interface to servoes; +V, Gnd, SIgnal. We have added a forth which is an analog input - thus header has 4 pins. You can still use regular servo's but by using our modified servo's you can have a lot more control because you now can read the actual position of the servo output arm.<pic of servo interface>MP3 Player:We use a standard DFplayer MP3 module, this is a very nice unit since it has SD card and built-in 3 Watt audio amplifier, volume control, equalizer, and supports upto 300 audio tracks.  By using a plug-in interface, should the DFplayer become obsolete or unavailable, another MP3 module can be used without any main board changes.  An Iphone (or similar) speaker is used for best volume/size performance.  It is connected directly to pads on the underside of the control board however a 2-pin header is available for external, wired speaker.<pic of MP3 and speaker connections>Gyro platform:An MPU6050 Gyro/Accelerometer is included on the board, standard SPI interface and uses standard Arduino libraries to interface. This module can be used for auto-balance, position feed-back, tilt/fall detection and much more. Thus a movement control can use the gyro as feedback to maintain the desired angle of movement rather than just move the servo to a desired position.Time-of-day clock:A very useful addition. This will keep time of day and calendar day of month. Great for alarms and creating AI functions. Software can a task or tasks to go off when alarm hits - cool!   The complete board can be powered down - including servo regulator - to reduce power consumption to standby levels. However, the TOD clock will keep on ticking so when it alarms, everything can power back up - very cool alarm clock here!USB/Serial interface:

 Standard Arduino Tx0/Rx0 is used for USB communications,

Tx0/Rx0 - Arduino USB port micro connector
Tx1/Rx1 - MP3 player header
Tx2/Rx2 - Wifi header
Tx3/Rx3 - available on header
Tx4/Rx4 - available on headerPower regulators: <pic  regulators>Power regulation is key. A lot of Arduino based boards provide power to the servo's from the regulated 5Vdc line. A low power, linear regulator if often used (7805 type) but this is not acceptable to power both the Arduino electronics and the servo's - too much current, power dissipation in regulator.  Our board has multiple regulators, each isolated and stable. The main input regulator is a buck (reduce) boost (increase) switch mode regulator which is about 90% efficient. This regulator accepts a wide input voltage but will maintain it's output, default 6 Volts for best servo performance, which can be user adjusted.  It will provide 3 amps of current, more than adequate for most standard servo types. The processor has it's own 5Vdc regulated power supply along with a 3.3Vdc regulator. Decoupling capacitors are numerous, essential for stable board operation. A thermal resettable fuse is used on servo power line, thus is servo(s) have a short/issue the processor power is still available - software keeps running.General Notes:The Atmega2560 has a lot on inputs/outputs. We do not use all of them and hence not all IO's are available on headers. Many IO pins are available that are not used on this project - you can use freely - using standard 0.1"" headers.  The board has been designed for longevity, anything that might become extinct is plug-in (MP3 module, Wifi, Gyro). This also allows for you to home-brew your board by using different modules.  Board is two layer, surface mounted components where applicable, pick-and-placed, IR reflowed. Board is loaded with standard Arduino Boot Loader and latest version of T4E BiPed Robot firmware. Learning how to walk!Pardon me, too much charging of my batteries!All my systems are functioning correctly, getting close to Memorial Day!Check this out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eswzwHv7_M&t=83sRoger That...",Ulric Lewis,$53,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Thu, July 12 2018 3:24 PM UTC +00:00","BiPed Robot with 7 DOF, Mp3 player, Wifi, Sonar, Gyro, SD card memory, IR TX/RX, OLED display, RTC, Tactile Sensing, AI learning.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,4, ,0,"$5,000",BiPed Robot by Ulric Lewis — Kickstarter

There are many smart lawnmowers on the market but it's not uncommon for them to have price points over $2000. While robots mowing your lawn may be a luxury for those well off enough to purchase one the price is simply too high for many to afford. The final product will combine sensors to explore the lawn, a wireless single button on/off control, and a simple 3D printed design with safety in mind.For the first time in history there are more acres devoted to lawns than to farming. That's a lot of grass and a lot of time mowing! Add to this the fact that lawnmowers still predominantly use fossil fuels and that many disabled people and elderly on fixed incomes cannot afford professional lawn care. Nanomow seeks to address these problems by creating a solar powered small footprint robotic lawnmower that can be afforded by those not simply wanting a relief from chores but for those who cannot physically mow their own lawn.

6,"The Scrobby Solar is:The Scrobby Solar makes your sustainable, independent and green energy project even greener.[NL] Een Nederlandse vertaling van deze project pagina is te openen via deze link.Besides being a cool new, sustainable, product, full of interesting technologies (did I mention you can control it using Bluetooth LE?) to analyse and play with?How dirty exactly? The opinions vary wildly, but findings from research, practical tests and end users indicate losses from a mere 3% per year to all the way up to 40% each year in areas near agriculture or industry.Whichever number applies to your system, one thing is sure: Some maintenance is needed to keep your solar panels happy.After its installation the Scrobby Solar requires no further action from you, you just flip the 'on' switch and go grab a coffee.The first rainfall after installation the Scrobby will go out cleaning and use its clever array of sensors to map your solar panel installation. The next rainfall it will consult its schedule and, if needed, start to clean your solar panels again. This schedule is user changeable through an app and Bluetooth Smart. The default setting results in three full cleans per year, which is a good starting point for almost any solar panel installation.What about self-cleaning coatings?There are several types of these coatings being developed right now. They mainly focus on desert environments, reducing dust build-up and extending cleaning intervals. The situation with solar panels mounted on houses is very different though, rainfall and mounting angle reduce the build-up of these particles anyway. Instead there are other sources of pollution. For example bird droppings, sadly no coating can make those bounce back!Aren't there other robots being developed?Yes there are! The main difference being that, so far, every other robot focusses on either large scale installations or rental usage. The Scrobby is designed specifically to work best on residential installations. This is especially clear when comparing the suggested retail price of the Scrobby Solar (€ 350) to a number of other robots available now:Why not just hire a cleaner?Having a solar panel installation is a long term investment. So let's take a quick look at some minimum prices for cleaning solar panels and compare them to the price of the Scrobby Solar. The Scrobby graph includes a year 5 check-up.While regular cleaning barely breaks even, the Scrobby Solar easily earns your investment back. It just makes sense.History: The start as a safety productHaving grown up in a roofing company that's older than I am, I've always had a connection with construction, worker safety and technology. My equal fascination for electronics, computers and engineering led me to work as a freelancer designer for the last 9 years. Among the many projects I worked on were safety systems for use in construction.About two years ago, while working on a different robotics idea, something 'clicked'. I could use that technology and turn it into a robot that could clean solar panels, avoiding unsafe cleaning work on rooftops altogether. I started working on this idea part time, each time refining the basic concept, throwing away what didn't work, improving what did, spending more and more time on it.A turning pointThis project started out with a system that was almost as expensive as current systems on the market. During the many design iterations in the year after starting it became clear there was another target achievable: A product that could make sense ecologically and economically on its own, by improving the efficiency of the solar panel installations without using external resources.The prototypesI've been evaluating many design iterations during the development process. This resulted in a first working prototype, in December 2013.Of course this prototype exposed many areas of improvements, but the general principle proved to work right off the bat. After this prototype the individual areas that could be improved were evaluated separately (to reduce both development costs and turnaround time).The findings of this stage of modular evaluation stage were combined with the gathered feedback from many manufacturers and suppliers and incorporated in a new prototype. While the basic principles remained the same, every single part but the power switch got an update.To give you an idea of the amount of testing involved: The following picture shows about one third of the parts evaluated.The current and final design of the Scrobby Solar is very similar the last prototype. It'll be slightly smaller due to more integrated electronics and slight packaging improvements. The bare 3D printed plastic will be replaced by a high quality epoxy coated plastic shell.ColourYou can have any colour, as long as it's white!Why? Because this results in the lowest internal temperature, making the device last longer. Which is great for everyone! At a later stage other colours will be evaluated, but right now the focus is on providing you with the best product.Specifications and performanceWill it work on my system?Below are the basic limits to what a single
 Scrobby Solar can service. On the left the system dimensions, on 
the right the inclination angles. In the Netherlands most houses have a 
30 to 45 degree inclined roof.Well, that's most of the demands done. Besides this the Scrobby can 
bridge the normal gaps between panels (less than 4 cm / 1.57"") and go 
around larger missing sections, as long as it's tethers are mounted in 
the topmost corners.The resting platform, as shown above, can be attached on either side of your installation.A Scrobby Solar kit consists of:The perks with multiple items receive the exact kit multiple 
times. Customised kits will come available at a later date. The settings
 app will be downloadable for free at the time of shipping.So far, I have been able to fund 
the design and development process completely on my own, but now 
the time has come to start with the production of the first Scrobby 
Solars.With your help I can start producing and shipping retail 
units. Besides being the first to be able to use the Scrobby Solar 
you'll be part of this amazing process of building an open, innovative 
business that will make green energy even greener!I'm a big technology fan and having learned a tremendous amount from existing open hard- and software. I'd like to do something back. The device itself and it's operating principles are patented to allow me to run my business, but I am going to publish as much of the software and designs as possible.These details, along with project logs will be posted on Hackaday Projects during the campaign.",Solar | Keeping your solar panels clean! by Stefan Hamminga,"€13,823","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sat, October 11 2014 8:01 AM UTC +00:00",Scrobby Solar is all you need to keep your solar panels clean. This little robot is easy to install and completely independent.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,66," Hi Stefan,~  Just found out about this project (I am new to Kickstarter anyway).~  I guess you are not going to make your goal, but I hope something comes from all of this. I'll still be interested if it's not a perfect consumer device. Perhaps with some self assembly needed or I don't know what else to get my hands this so I don't have to climb up the roof with a scrubbing brush and clean them myself.~  Perhaps next time more exposure? I don't know where you can find a lot of that but perhaps the Dutch ZPV ( http://www.zonnestroomproducenten.org ) or stat sites like http://pvoutput.org would be willing to put an article in a news letter.~  Have a nice weekend!Jeroen~  Hi Michiel,~  I opted not to include an optical sensor to determine how dirty the panels are. I did do some testing with several optical sensors, but the difference between panels in terms of surface coatings, top layer materials, solar cell types and backgrounds made getting an universal read on the dirt build-up difficult.Instead of adding a complex, not very reliable and expensive system I went for the option of making the device more affordable and accessible.~  Regards,Stefan~  How does Scrobby know ....~  Hi Stefan,How does Scrobby nows the panels are clean? Does it check for reflections, or does clean each area the same amount of time (but long enough to get rid of real clunky bird droppings ;-)?~  Thanks, Fred! I really appreciate you helping out like this! Of course I'd be happy to help him and his customers with any questions they might have.~  Regards,Stefan~  Thank you for your quick responses. I've sent a link to the contractor who installed my panels hoping he will recommend your system to his other customers. I very much want this project to succeed!~  Hi Fred,~  The schedule is chosen to accommodate the average, inexperienced user. It's easier to increase the amount of cleaning jobs for those who need it than to reduce the frequency for those who want a device that just works out of the box.Setting a higher frequency will cause a bit more wear on the battery and mechanics, but you'll earn back quicker too.~  Regards,Stefan~  The articles all reference the three cleans per year schedule, but do note that the schedule can be changed. Why would the default be so infrequent? Six times per year would be more effective for my installation, but does an increase in frequency mean sooner battery death or simply greater wear?~  Hi Lee,~  The wires are made of an UV resistant PE plastic. I've consulted several manufacturers with decades of experience in this field and, while there are slightly stronger fibres on the market, these wires will not degrade much over 10 years.~  Both of the spools have more wire on them than required (approx. 30m), so most installations can suffice with simply snipping the damaged part off and attach the remaining wire back to the mount. Of course there will be limits to what can be done this way, past this it'll be a matter of removing the top shell, taking out the remaining wire and rewinding the spool (this is done mostly automatically, my prototype spools have been wound by the device itself).~  For the shell I took a similar path, consulting multiple highly experienced manufacturers. They unanimously agreed that an UV resistant ASA polymer would work great for the Scrobby Solar. Besides that there will be an extra layer of protective coating. The design minimizes stress in the top shell to improve impact toughness.Of course anything can be destroyed, but even the 3D printed prototypes are sturdy enough to be thrown around during testing.~  Regards,Stefan~  Hi Stefan,What are the wires made out of and can they be easily replaced if damaged or broken?  Living in Australia, UV is a big thing when it comes to plastics outside, how does the case of the Scrobby stand up to intense UV? and hail?Thanks~  Hi Fred,~  Great to hear the adjustments to your system are possible! I've added a limited batch of three and four unit sets to accommodate you.~  The irregular shape will be mapped fine with the default software, there is no requirement for the system to have a rectangular based shape. The patterns of travel question is interesting. So far I've actually been working at depending as little as possible on preprogrammed patterns, instead relying on sensor data. I will investigate if it makes sense to include pattern options, if so, I'll let you know!~  Hi Marinus,~  Thanks for your compliment! To give you a quick answer on your questions in reverse order:~  Yes, it'll be possible to narrow the cleaning window to exclude a period of time each day. As long as there is enough rainfall in the allocated time you'll be fine.~  The Scrobby Solar parks on a small platform. The platform is bolted to the side of your panels and has a retaining ring which narrowly fits over the device. The aerodynamic shape of the device itself is optimised to reduce wind sensitivity, the retaining ring is shaped like a centring cone on the inside and is an extra protection feature.The Scrobby also has sensors to detect a strong wind or gusts of wind, to make sure it stays on the resting pad during stormy weather.The resting platform and the retaining ring can been seen about 3/4th down the page.~  About extra video material: I really have my hands full right now, I've been receiving interest and messages from all over the world, which is really amazing! I hope I can work on some more videos for you soon.~  Regards,Stefan~  Nice project, I am ecite to see a video of a Scrobby in action on an actual irregular PV array.Second, where does it park when not cleaning? I presume outside the panel area on a separate platform? How secure is it in stormt weather?Third, can you program the cleaning moments? I would like it to clean after the sun goes down but not in the middle of the night.~  I double checked the clamps. The bolts stick up about 30mm but can be reduced below panel level. The clamps are 45 degree ramps that are about 6mm above the panel and only 25mm wide, so it appears that should not be a problem The gap between panels is 25mm and can be bridged with so many different materials that I'm sure that won't be a problem either.~  My widest array is 6.6m in an irregular shape. All but one of the four arrays are irregular. I am hopeful that the programming can be more than only array side limits and can include patterns of travel.~  One of the arrays is very peculiar, a stair step configuration with each panel above and to one side of the previous. I think I will have to construct level bridges to allow Scrobby to travel the distance, but it will not be a problem. There are rails to enable such construction in place for the panels.~  I've adjusted my pledge to represent two Duo bundles.~  Hi Fred,~  First off, great to have your support in this project! I really appreciate it.I'm also going to have to disappoint a bit, maybe. I can say you should try it, but with 40mm bolts sticking out it's not going to work that well. 20-25mm is quite doable, but more is asking for trouble.I'd be happy to sell you a Scrobby, but I want you to have a good experience. If you think it's doable to cut them, let me know and I'll make you an option to get 4 units.~  Regards,Stefan~  I should have read a bit more thoroughly... I found the Change Pledge option and have corrected it to the Duo package and pledged for two Duo bundles.~  Between my panels are clamps from which the bolts extend about 25-40 mm. Will the Scrobby be able to navigate over those? I expect that I can cut them shorter if needed, perhaps to install some form of sleeping policeman/speed bumps to make it easier.~  You have a great design! Very much needed for my part of the USA.~  I have many panels spread over four surfaces. I'm going to add one more to my pledge, for a total of four. I see the item count reduced by only one even though I pledged enough for three, soon to be four. I hope this is not a problem. I see that I should have pledged for two of the duo packages. Can this be corrected?~  There is no reference for shipping costs. Is that a later add-on? It could be expensive, especially for US backers.~  This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.~  This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.~  This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.~  This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.~  This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.~  This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.~  ",0,"€75,000",Scrobby Solar | Keeping your solar panels clean! by Stefan Hamminga — Kickstarter

 We also open source our CAD drawings: We are compatible with all other popular open source hardware:Additional features that we diligently engineered:Safety Mechanisms: Designed with safety in mind. To minimize risk of injury, the propellers are custom designed out of lightweight, soft plastic alongside our intelligent speed controllers that automatically disable the rotors whenever something interferes with the propellers. Eedu also features redundant processors so crashes can be avoided in case of hardware failure. 

 Advanced Autopilot: Eedu features a fully functional autopilot that includes a 9 Axis IMU, barometer, current and voltage sensors. This means all the flight controls are handled while you can focus on developing high level applications. Just tell Eedu where to go, and it will go. It can even be told to follow you around!

 High Level Core: Powered by Intel Edison. We have worked with Intel to integrate Edison into Eedu. Intel Edison is a powerful and capable dual core Atom computer that gives Eedu one of the most advanced processors available on any drone platform. Edison enables programs to easily be created on a full Linux OS, and with processing power to spare, to develop applications that will advance drones beyond current capabilities.

 Documentation: Forge and the Intel Edison Linux Yocto recipe is provided as open source software. We will continue to work closely with the community to provide and maintain a repository for source code and documentation that supports the latest embedded frameworks and hardware APIs.Students are our inspiration. From our experience with STEAM outreach, we find that students are excited about emerging drone technology and become highly engaged when they can do hands-on projects. Lots of them have unique ideas and want to develop valuable skill sets so they can work with drones in the future. We want them to gain the confidence to become a future Dronesmith.In addition to selling you the kit itself, we are also giving you the option to buy one for a student or to buy a classroom pack for our Inspire a Dronesmith Campaign.More than ever, schools are having a hard time acquiring technology. We passionately believe that students’ accessibility to technology should not be hindered! As such, we are creating a donation fund that will allow us to distribute drones to schools across the nation. If you choose the Inspire a Dronesmith reward, your donated drone will be entered into the campaign pool that is used to award various schools that partake in our social campaign in Q3. By choosing to fund a Classroom Pack reward, you can specify the school that will receive the pack. Our team will take care of end-to-end distribution of these donations, and keep you informed throughout the delivery process.This campaign will raise money to cover the cost of the initial manufacturing setup and the funding of software development. We are also initiating a message for people to invest in educational technology and enable future generation of Dronesmiths. We believe in order to be able to make drone technology more accessible to everyone, this kind of educational platform is needed - and we need your backing to support our belief!Skyworks Aerial Systems (SkyworksAS) is comprised of recent college graduates who share a passion for drone technology and STEAM initiatives. We are an interdisciplinary team with expertise in electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering.

 CandyCam, LLC, creates and sells affordable multimedia robotics to filmmakers and indoor venues for unprecedented control for recording live-action events and scripted video sequences. Two years ago, the team at CandyCam set out to free your camera from its positional limitations. While we were developing the SkyHook for professionals, we were asked to develop a portable, cost-reduced unit for cameras under 32 ounces; the SkyHook Mini is that product. This Kickstarter campaign allows us to leverage our experience building the high-end SkyHook to manufacture the smaller, more-affordable SkyHook Mini.
SkyHook - An easy to use robotic camera positioning platform that redefines the way videographers work.  Recording live-action events and scripted video sequences is more than a vocation. It's an art form, communicating stories and live events through striking visuals. The SkyHook changes the way these stories can be told, and elevates the craft of filmmaking to new heights. CandyCam designed the SkyHook to meet the needs of videographers for rapid deployment, flexibility and precision, while addressing many of the limitations of traditional positioning equipment.The SkyHook Mini is a cost-reduced model that provides semi-professional videographers the opportunity to experience a full range of stabilized movement at a fraction of the cost. Supporting high definition cameras under 32 ounces, the SkyHook Mini is designed to work with the new generation of small cameras that enthusiast videographers are using. Here's a sample video of the SkyHook flying over a college basketball arena - note the rapid setup and ease of operation. The SkyHook Mini is a remotely controlled robotic camera platform suspended over any space by eight cables via four anchor points. It can be programmed to shoot scripted sequences, or flown without a pre-defined path to allow impromptu moments to be captured. The overhead location of the platform allows the SkyHook Mini an unprecedented range of motion, and gives videographers the power to make their vision a reality.CandyCam is a group of artists and engineers based in Kansas City that saw a chance to do something different. We knew there was a gap between the creative vision of videographers and what they could do with current equipment. CandyCam created the SkyHook to fill that gap.We're a company driven by big vision. But, taking ideas from concept to creation requires more than talk. We've created a culture where everyone works together, refining and iterating, until the best ideas win.By working 'round the clock and drinking coffee straight from the pot, we're creating products that reflect the strength of our commitment. Our job isn't done until videographers have tools that fully empower their craft.Getting the job done right requires a lot of testing and feedback. We're always open to new ideas and fresh perspectives, so feel free to contact us with thoughts and feedback.Featured in Kansas City Business JournalFeatured on KCPT's Startups: Made in Kansas City    Featured in Silicon Prairie News SPNFinalist for Silicon Prairie Awards 2013Presented at Kauffman Foundation's1 Million Cups PresentationThis Kickstarter campaign will allow us to quickly take our experience with our high-end SkyHook and make a smaller, cost-effective unit that can be used with lighter cameras.
 
We're now ready and eager to bring the SkyHook Mini to the masses! We need YOUR help. With funding from Kickstarter backers, we will put every dollar towards bringing the SkyHook Mini to the market and making it available to CandyCam flyers.CandyCam's SkyHook product line works by anchoring eight high-tension lines to four points on the ceiling or columns. These microfilament braided lines are controlled via motors and are stabilized by distributed computers in the same way a modern stealth fighter achieves stability. At the bottom of the SkyHook Mini's platform is an integrated robotic gimbal that offers controlled three-axis motion while cradling the camera. SkyHook products are currently limited to jogging speeds within a 60’x60’ space. The SkyHook Mini supports smaller-format GoPro, Virb, and other cams lighter than 18oz, while the SkyHook professional will fly equipment up to 10 pounds.

11,"Do
you remember how much it snowed last year? How much you stayed outside in that
cold weather and sweated to clean the driveway? Wouldn't it be cool to have a
robot to do this job? You can sit inside and drive the robot with a camera
system, it will clean your driveway.We
would like to make the snow cleaning job easier and even fun so we have
designed and built our first prototype of the SnowBYTE.The robot body is made of aluminum and manufactured
by laser cutting. The Design of the body made it very strong regardless of the aluminum as the main body material.The power source of the first prototype is 4 units of 12VDC
batteries and the drive system is working with 2 DC motors which are running
the tracks.After
a huge number of calculations we came with a new design to overcome problems
faced in the first prototype.In
order to solve the lack of power, the new version is powered by a one cylinder
30cc gasoline engine which can provide 2.7 HP energy. The snow throwing mechanism and the front blades are powered mechanically by the gasoline engine.When the robot
is running, the starter is used as dynamo to fill the batteries. By using this hybrid system the gas engine mechanical power is converted into electricity which is stored in
the batteries to be used by the 4x4 drive system as well as by the starter, so
that you don't need to pull a rope to start your robot engine.We've made the robot to be able to clean (servo
speed) 33,3 m/min (109,25 feet/min). The robot's front blade is 36 cm
wide(14,17 inches)  and 21cm high(8,27). So that you can clean 11,88 m2/min
(127,88 feet2/min).The thrower part is designed to rotate 4 times
faster than the front blades, so that you can really throw your snow out. As an option SnowBYTE is equipped with an attachable blade under the body of the robot, making it a lawn mower - GrassBYTE.
Speed: 33,3 m/min – 109,25 feet/minWidth: 36 cm – 14,17 inchesBlade height: 21 cm – 8,27 inchesSnow throwing capacity: 11,88 m2/min –

He has built an Explosive Ordnance Disposal robot for the Turkish Air Force, and another portable IED robot for the Istanbul Police Force will be completed this year. Different mobile robot platforms are needed for rescue operations and some of the platforms he has built include a fireproof firefighting robot, a screw wheel omnidirectional platform, an 8x8 portable border patrol robot and a camera stabilization system for an all-terrain robot. Majid is a Ph.D. student in Mechatronics Engineering, in Istanbul Technical University. He has a Master and Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, with extensive experience in Ardupilot, calibration, motor drivers and sensors. He has been responsible for electrical and electronics design and implementation in many robotic and automation projects both for university and industry. In this project, he will be realizing the electronics of the SnowBYTE.

12,"A lot of you asked for a video of OutRunner going OffRoad, here you go, nothing can stop it! (gravel, grass, up and down hills...)OutRunner is the world's first legged running robot that is commercially available to the public. That's right—a running robot! OutRunner is eating up the competition with amazing capabilities: self-balancing, running up to 20 mph on almost any types of terrains (grass, asphalt, dirt...) with up to 2 hours of battery life, extremely simple to operate and upgradable. There is simply no other robot with such capabilities and so easy and fun to play with. All you need to do is just press the accelerator and steer it wherever you want it to go; it's that easy. Let the fun begin!OutRunner comes in two versions: Core and Performance. OutRunner Core is the version you need If you just want to play around with the robot and have fun. OutRunner Performance is a much more powerful version packed with state-of-the-art sensors that will turn any race against your friends into something totally epic !Robotics Unlimited is a spinoff of the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) where a team of scientists and engineers have been working for years toward the development of walking and running robots. Part of the IHMC robotics team has been spending their time figuring out how to make a robotic system capable of running while maintaining stability. While research robots are very expensive machines dedicated to lab experiments, Robotics Unlimited's founder wanted to have a robot easy to operate, relatively low cost to build but still providing amazing running capability. After several months of thinking, testing and prototyping, OutRunner was born.Why are robots doing great things only in movies? Why
is it that the only people enjoying robots right now are scientists or
engineers? At Robotics Unlimited, we are tired of these trends and are on a
journey to change this status-quo. We believe that robots should be a part of
everybody's life and that they should be easy and fun to interact with while
still doing amazing things. OutRunner is here to prove that to you.Well, as you will see in our video, OutRunner robots are biologically-inspired; they emulate the behavior of legged animals by reproducing their step pattern and having a similar mass / length distribution. By having a center of mass lower than the leg axis of rotation, OutRunner robots exploit a buoyancy effect, making them inherently stable and eliminating the need for expensive sensors and complex control algorithms. Energy efficiency is achieved by exploiting the same feature observed in legged animals; using legs as an energy storage system allows for fluctuation and conservation (and not losses) of potential and kinetic energy during running. Because of this energy storage mechanism, OutRunner is able to run for 2h whereas a RC car with the same battery will run only for 20 min max. Steering is achieved by shifting the center of mass of the robot, forcing it to lean to one side, which in result induces a turn (similarly to what happens on a bicycle). These are the basic concepts behind the OutRunner robot; and even if there is much more going on, the robot takes care of it for you so that the only thing you have to worry about is to have fun with it!Few people asked us if OutRunner was capable of running on grass, he sure does. Below is a raw video of one of our first test of the robot on grass, Enjoy !Just to prove you how stable OutRunner is, we got the robot running with only 4 legs !
If you just want to play around with the robot and have fun, this is the version you need. The core version is able to run up to 10 mph and has an battery life of 1 hour. It is controlled via a standard remote control. The robot has 6 legs and is equipped with a Universal Camera Mount (camera not included, 1/4"" thread). If you want to have more sensors but don't have the budget yet for the Performance version, no worries, we will offer sensor upgrades that will allow you to get more out of your OutRunner Core. This version is about 1.5 foot tall and weighs a little bit less than 3 pounds. Coming in several designs and equipped with a powerful out-runner brushless motor, the Performance version is the model you need to race your friend. It is able to run up to 20 mph and is equipped with a state-of-the-art battery that provides up to 2 hours of fun. The robot comes with 12 legs and will be able to run with 6, 8, 10 or 12 legs - your choice. It is controllable via a remote or via your smartphone. Sensor-wise, the Performance version is equipped with a 6 degrees of freedom Inertial Measurement Unit (Accelerometer and Gyroscope) and a onboard High Definition camera (720p, 30fps). The robot also has a Universal Camera Mount (camera not included ,1/4"" thread). Sensor data and video are live streamed on your smartphone via WiFi. One of the best things about the Performance version is that we will offer hardware and software upgrades to push further the performance of your robot. The robot is slightly taller than 2 feet and weighs about 5 pounds.We are working on great designs to customize your robot. By pledging any amount, you will be able to submit or vote for your favorite designs. The top ten designs will make it to the production stage, and you'll be able to pick up the one you want for your robot.As
a part of our plan to make the OutRunner even more enjoyable, we are planning
to release several upgrades for the Core and Performance versions that will
allow you to customize your robot. These upgrades will be available through our
website immediately after the shipment of the OutRunners. All upgrades will be
plug and play, which means that you will be able to install them yourself. You
will be able to upgrade the core version with more sensors and the performance
version with new hardware.  Since it is taking a lot of time and effort to
design, manufacture, and ensure the quality of new components, upgrade
availability for the performance version will be based on how much support we
receive during the KickStarter campaign (see stretching goals section for a
detailed list). Additionally, for those of you who want to go deeper in the
customization process, we will offer a software upgrade that will allow you to
tune the parameters of the controllers and motor drivers similarly to the way
that you can tune a car engine.What
will be the most exciting and the most rewarding thing for a company like us?
Well, it's fairly simple—obviously, we want to see people have fun with our
products; but deeper, what's really motivating us is to create a community of
robotics enthusiasts that breathe and share the same passion. For a long time,
the founder of Robotics Unlimited had something in mind to this end: organizing
the world's first competition of running robots. We will try to set up this
event by the end of 2015 or closely after. This time frame will give roughly 6
months to anybody who purchased an OutRunner to prepare for what we call ""The Robot Race."" Our initial
plan is to organize the competition around three races: a drag race, an
endurance race, and a slalom race. With this event, we really hope to
foster the love of robotics and look forward to seeing a huge diversity of
participants (hobbyists, researchers, students, etc.). This will also be the perfect
occasion to compare robots and share our discoveries. Of course, to make things even more fun, we will allow modification to the OutRunners. But keep in mind that even the best robot is nothing without a good pilot! So who's going to be the
best robot pilot? It may be you, who knows...Developing
and testing a robot is a timely and cost-intensive process. Our initial research
work brought us to the alpha stage of development. We proved that the science
worked, which is the biggest risk in a project like this. Since our first
prototype, we have come a long way. We have identified potential failure modes
and have fine-tuned the remote control resolution; we have performed hundreds
of tests and after many prototypes, are really confident in the capacities and
robustness of our robots. We are few steps away from bringing this robot to you,
and this is where we need you. Your support will help us to achieve the
following goals:",Robotics Unlimited,"$62,271","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sat, June 7 2014 10:24 PM UTC +00:00","Meet OutRunner, the world's first remotely controlled robot running  up to 20 mph on various terrain with up to 2 hours of battery life",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,217," Great project!!!

A smart phone is ubiquitous, low cost, fast evolving in technologies, always connected to internet, and its programming is easy to learn! That's why we made the smart phone the brain of LAB. The flight control is reliably taken care by a dedicated processor, to which the smart phone sends commands via USB or Bluetooth, so that everyone can concentrate on determine high-level functions on the phone with imagination via minimal coding. LAB is an advanced platform as the future aerial robotics.You can personalize the look of LAB on the phone display as a living bot with visual images and appearance. You can advertise impressive promotion on LAB from air. LAB can be pivotal to execute urgent missions: (1) When a patient in a critical condition is located remotely or far away from hospitals, doctors can give immediate and tangible instructions visually on LAB display.  (2) LAB can be air surveillance patrol to monitor security check to alert suspicious intrusions from air.We invite everyone to join and develop LAB by easy programming for imaginative and challenging missions. Our number 1 priority is the safety, which makes us to incorporate two levels of the control systems: (1) a reliable main flight controller for basic aviation motions of LAB; (2) the smart phone to run ""Drone Apps"", which implement advanced sensing and intelligent functions. Even if the phone freeze up, the main flight controller will take charge of LAB flight condition and safe landing.The LAB API will help you to integrate readily into your own App. The API and flight controller handles all the critical tasks and let you focus on designing the interactive aspects. For example, in your App, you simply call:The LAB API is based on Android environment currently. If you like to hack or create App for iOS, you can write commands in MAVLINK protocol directly over Serial connection to handle everything as you like.Just tap Install, your LAB will get a new Brain by App! Everyone can create and distribute Apps for LAB. We believe the open system will change the world of drones. To ignite the ecosystem, two official Apps for LAB running on Android are our initial basis:An integrated controller App for LAB to explore the possibility of future drones. myLAB integrates advanced techniques such as OpenCV image recognition, assisted GPS for Indoor navigation, real time cloud control and telemetry etc. You can easily create interactive skins, which can be import to myLAB. Or you can make myLAB as a starting point to expand your own App. myLAB is open source. We will continuously and timely keep myLAB updated to adapt advanced functions.Forget analog AV transmitters and receivers in traditional First-Person view (FPV) flight! With two phones connected to internet or WiFi, LAB greatly simplify the FPV setup. LAB FPV will support a Google Cardboard and incorporate software image gimbal and stabilization. LAB brings the digital and light generation of flight experience into reality!LAB can hold any smart phone with size up to 165mm (L) x 90mm (W) x 10mm (D) (Up to Google Nexus 6, iPhone 6 Plus ready). We implement a unique universal fixture to accommodate phones with varied dimension safely. Our design ensures no propellers in the sight of a phone camera.The phone is held by vertical bracket with vibration absorber inside, the two front arms rotate both sides of the phone. To cut out the motor vibration, normally the arms do not touch the phone; however, even when phone is loosened in flight, the arms will protect it from falling. The arms can rotate and maintain any position tightly, by a rock solid friction hub stopper made by ultra strong Aluminum 7075 alloy and Stainless bolt inside. There is also a clicker embedded to indicate and remember the stopping position.LAB is powerful to fly with 550g payloads (phone and battery). Meanwhile, a folded LAB easily fits into a backpack. The small factor lets you easily bring LAB when traveling and wow the world.To make it light, tough and durable, LAB is made by 3K Carbon Fiber and Aluminum 7075 alloy anodized CNC parts with professional designs and analysis.LAB is an Open Source Hardware & Software, we are exciting to see how people utilize the advanced functionalities on a phone to make drones intelligent, such as Image/Voice recognition for hand gesture control, assisted GPS for Indoor navigation, Route direction and Artificial Intelligence.The dimensions of parts will be available online so that everyone can design and make its extensions, or optimize existing parts. The source code of LAB API and official Apps will be released on GitHub after our Kickstarter campaign.We stepped into the world of robotics from two years ago. We self-invested our initial development and made LAB. Now we invite you to take part in making LAB a reality for everyone who believes in the future of robotics. With your generous support, we can kick off mass-production of hardware parts, create injection molds as well as develop smart software packages. Everything of LAB is open source, which is available to everyone. Your gifts and support will be honored and appreciated by all of us, which are a pivotal driving force to advance technologies forward.LabRomance Inc. is a developer of robots founded by former researchers at Stanford University and The University of Tokyo.

16,"Ruku Robot is a robot that can solve a Rubik's cube, but more than that it is a fun, interactive, teaching tool that engages people of all ages. Ruku Robot comes as a kit that students assemble and during the building process gain a greater understanding of subjects such as Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). We built it to be the perfect robotic kit for any STEM classroom. Purchase the Ruku Robot kit and soon you will have all the parts necessary to build your own robot. Ruku is an affordable STEM resource for educators, students and developers. Use Ruku Robot to grasp the fundamentals of robotics, computer science and engineering. As you can see Ruku is made from colorful and high quality components that will last and last.   Watch Ruku in action, shown here solving a Rubik's Cube in 12 seconds!Ruku is 100% open source, meaning all the hardware and software is available for students and developers to modify and contribute to.  We believe in the open source movement because we know the power of many great minds can bring technology to new heights.This video says it all!  Did you know the Rubik's cube is one of most famous toys in the world and 1 in 6 kids have played with one?   Also it is gender neutral appealing to both boys and girls, keeping them entertained for hours.  As Erno Rubik (The creator of the Rubik's cube) once said ""Once I completed the Cube and demonstrated it to my students, I realized it was nearly impossible to put down."" which we totally believe is true!  Thank you Erno for making this wonderful toy!Ruku was built from the ground up to challenge and engage students of any skill level.  Ruku is a kit for anyone that wants to learn about Robotics, Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and wants to have fun while doing it.  We have lesson plans for middle school ages and up.  We also think it would be great for college students or graduates that want a fun and interesting robot to build.    Are you an STEM educator?Ruku is also aimed at educators that need an exciting project for their classroom, since it already comes with teacher and student lesson plans it is the perfect teaching tool. What is STEM?STEM education is increasing in demand and we are happy to be part of the movement towards creating more STEM learning opportunities for students.  We are seeing Robotics clubs, Computer Science classrooms, and summer classes popping up everywhere.  Hands on activities it makes learning fun and interesting. When we (the founders of Ruku) were kids, we didn’t have the internet or computers in our homes, let alone in our pockets. The most basic electronics seemed amazing to us.  We spent hours playing with Legos and erector sets, which became the basic building blocks of learning that led to us becoming the engineers we are today. However we understand the increasing desire of adults and children to be inspired by and learn through interacting with new technology. We have seen Ruku Robot amaze and engage classrooms full of students.  We hope Ruku Robot will inspire children to become the next leaders in STEM professions. Why is Ruku Robot an excellent STEM education tool for girls? It is based around the worlds best selling toy, the Rubik’s cube. The Rubik’s cubes popularity is based on its ability to equally engage both girls and boys due to it’s gender neutral design. Children and adults are innately curious about how things work and puzzles such as the Rubik’s cube engage that curiosity. Unfortunately in today's world we find examples of toy manufacturers using gender stereotypes when marketing their products, pushing princess dolls dressed in pink to little girls and construction toys painted yellow and black to little boys. These messages are repeated again and again in toy stores, advertisements, and even in classrooms. There is a movement in education to encourage young children to embrace Science, Technology, Engineering and Math education, with a special emphasis on young girls. The data is clear that while women are at almost equal numbers in graduating with Chemistry, Material Science and Biological Science degrees, they fall well below in the Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science fields. Teachers and parents are aware of the need to encourage young girls in these fields but often don’t know where to look for resources that can engage them. Ruku Robot is the answer to their problems. The robot not only continues with the gender neutral color scheme of the Rubik’s cube itself, it also encourages collaboration. Girls inherently enjoy a collaborative environment where critical thinking, creativity and communication are encouraged. This robotics kit is perfect for group projects and the online community, that fosters a collaborative environment. We are the tool that parents and educators can use to nurture these young girls curiosity about Robotics, Math and Engineering.We have put some amazing incentives together for this Kickstarter campaign, and every Incentive you purchase helps us tremendously to reach our goal!   Incentive $5 (Every Incentive comes with this of course) A huge thank you to all of our supporters, we will put your name on our website!Incentive $15 - Stickers + App + Thank you! Awesome Ruku Stickers! Our App for Android an iOS that can show you how to solve any cube by detecting the colors of any standard Rubik's Cube!  It is also a virtual 3D Rubik's cube that you can use if you do not have a real one. Incentive $29 - High Speed Professional 3x3 Cube + Stickers + App + Thank you!This Rubik's Cube is one of the best on the market and has a 5 star rating on Amazon.  It is what we call a ""magic"" cube because it is used by speed cubers all around the world, and is the type of cube people use to break the cube solving speed records.  We love this cube so much it comes with every Ruku Robot!   Incentive $55 - Premium Ruku T-Shirt + High Speed Professional 3x3 Cube + Stickers + App + Thank you!Incentive $149-$199 - Basic Ruku Robot kit + High Speed Professional 3x3 Cube + Stickers + App + Thank you!Wow look at all those awesome parts!

17,"Seek N’ Sneak is an Arduino powered self-controlled robot which is able to run around, find  objects, grab them, relocate them and do many other useful and funny things.

  Why did we develop this robot? There is a very short answer: kids! They need 10 to 30 minutes (depending on their temper) to scatter literally all the toys they have over their rooms, so initially we were looking for some way to automate a tedious process of daily toys collection. We solved this problem, but we realized that there are many other cool applications for this robot. We found that our robot can be smart, fast, strong, fearless and funny, just like a badger, and we named it Seek N’ Sneak.The two driving wheels of this robot are powered by independently controlled motors and equipped with 128-steps-per-revolution encoders allowing for precise control of the angular position of the wheel, as well as its velocity and acceleration. An independent 2D orientation of the rover is provided by two side mounted IR proximity meters. Objects are detected by the third centered IR proximity meter. The three IR sensors can be replaced by one PING)))™ Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.
 The arm is run by 3 super-strong servo-motors, so it is fast and powerful enough to push up about 3 pounds, or even lift the robot itself, or throw objects.Seek N’ Sneak is an Arduino Mega 2560 powered robot. The robot software is completely open sourced, so you can either use the original software which has already been developed for you, or you can modify it as you please to meet your demands. You can then use commands like LOOK FOR AN OBJECT, GRAB or THROW instead of writing low-level code to control the sensors, motors and servos directly or develop your own way of thinking for the robot from scratch using the Arduino integrated development environment.Though Seek N’ Sneak was designed as a fully autonomous, upgradable robot. There is plenty of space inside the body of the robot to extend Arduino board with extra sensors or with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth shields to establish communication with a computer or remote control.Seek N’ Sneak’s body and arm parts, depending on the kit you choose, are made of either 5mm laser cut black acrylic glass, 3mm laser cut galvanized aluminum or 2mm milled carbon-fiber composite.8.4 - 9.6V accumulator (not included*) is used as the only power supply.The most impressive thing is that the robot runs as a fully independent  unit:
 - it can find and collect objects on the ground, - chase and attack other robots - you can make it organize your living space, placing things back in place whenever they are found where they should not be.  You are only limited by your imagination.
- it can't fly... yet,
 - it has no any ""+18"" application, at least we did not try, - we did not integrate the Three Laws of Robotics in the robot's brain yet, so be careful :). * Accumulator is not included; see recommended type of accumulator here (9.6V) or here (8.4V).   We made a lot of modifications, but most of them were made on paper.

19,"Campaign ending soon!Please visit http://www.fdl1.com and signup for the FDL-1 mailing list to stay updated on the progress of the final FDL-1 design and release date. The FDL-1 will be still be released even if I don't meet my funding goal.Follow me and the FDL-1 here:Twitter: https://twitter.com/JesseKovarovicsFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FDL-1-1399278507045533The FDL-1 is the culmination of years of taking things apart and putting them back together. A perfect storm of hobby technology and geek creativity, the FDL-1 is a project for makers and tinkerers. It's for those who choose to build their own things. Those who want a foam dart launcher they can call their own, unlike any other.3D PrintedAside from it's hardware and electronics, the FDL-1 is completely 3D printed. It is designed piece by piece to be printed on even the most modest of consumer printers with a minimum build size of 6""x6""x6"". Each part is designed to be easily printed with very little support and bridging required. The FDL-1 you see in the video and pictures was printed on a Printrbot Simple Metal. 3D printer filament is available in a variety of colors allowing the FDL-1 to be printed in a wide range of colors and color combinations.RoboticUnlike your usual foam dart blaster, the FDL-1 is robotic. It is controlled by a programmable Particle Photon microchip rather than pure mechanics. This allows it to be tuned and tweaked to perform to it's users ideals. It can carry out preprogrammed commands and repetitive maneuvers as well as given the precise locations of targets.Web EnabledThe FDL-1 has wifi built directly into it's microchip. This allows it to be controlled from virtually anywhere. Connect it to your home or office wifi network then operate it from anywhere with an internet connection using your phone, tablet, or computer.High Powered & Fully AutomaticThe FDL-1 is capable of launching darts faster and farther than any foam dart blaster on the market. The speed of the flywheel motors can be adjusted on the fly, meaning you can launch darts at a gentle, office safe speed, at near paintball level velocities or anywhere in between. It is fully automatic and capable of launching an entire clip of 12 Nerf Mega size darts in a matter of seconds with a single pull of the trigger. It is created for the hobbyist market where bigger is better and it promises to deliver. ConvertibleThe FDL-1 comes in two forms. Turret and blaster. It can be converted between the two forms with ease. In turret form, you can place the the FDL-1 on a desk or even mount it on the corner of a cubicle. You operate it from your device with a web app on the FDL-1 website. In blaster form the FDL-1 acts as any other blaster. Wifi is disabled and a battery is installed in the handle so it can operate free of wires and remote control.Open SourceThe purpose of the FDL-1 campaign is to empower people to create their own things. Once the FDL-1 website is launched, all the files, schematics, and instructions you'll need to create your own FDL-1 will be available to everyone free of charge. Using the print files, you can print all the parts that make up the FDL-1 on your own. Using the schematics, you'll be able to identify all the electronic and hardware components needed to assemble your launcher. All of this will be provided under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license. That means anyone may copy, distribute, modify, create, and even sell derivatives of the FDL-1 as long as the original author, this guy, is given credit for the original design and that those derivatives also carry the same license. No matter what form the FDL-1 takes in my hands or yours, it will always be open source.Help a Guy Out TierChoose this tier if you love the FDL-1 and just want to help a guy out. Contribute a buck or contribute more, it's up to you. I thank you for your support no matter what. I will give a shout out to all backers on the FDL-1 site when launched.Prototype TierChoose this tier if you are like me and can't wait to take on new projects. Up to 75 backers in this tier will be able to access the files and schematics to print and build the exact FDL-1 that you see in the pictures and video on this site. Once I make my final round of design changes, these schematics will cease to exist in favor of the version that I release as open source.Gift TierIn the Gift tier you will receive a 3D printed desk statue of the FDL-1. This statue signifies my thanks to you as a backer and shows your support to your friends and coworkers.The Print Your Own Tier The Print Your Own tier is intended for backers with their own 3D printer. You will receive the electronics, hardware, and filament required to print and assemble your own FDL-1 in blaster only form or blaster/turret combo. Choose up to two filament colors for blaster only or up to four colors for the blaster/turret combo.Kit TierThe Kit tier is intended for backers who do not have their own 3D printer but would like to build their FDL-1 themselves. As with any kit, you will learn about the mechanics of the FDL-1. You will receive the electronics, hardware, and printed parts required to assemble your FDL-1 in blaster only form or blaster/turret combo. Choose up to two colors.Assembled TierIf you want to open the box and go, choose the Kit tier. You will receive a fully assembled FDL-1 in either blaster form or blaster/turret combo form. Choose up to two colors.What are you going to do with my money?What I would like to do is print an initial run of FDL-1's to help launch a line of various FDL kits and accessories. The line will start with the FDL-1 and will gradually add FDL's of varying sizes and designs as well as a multitude of accessories. Think tank treads, wheels, cameras, motion sensors, etc. The possibilities are endless. I will build a website to sell this lineup as well as host the files and schematics needed to print and create your own parts. This website will also host any web apps created to control and tune your FDL.

While I would love for every backer to print and build their own FDL-1 from scratch, my part in all of this is to make the FDL-1 available to people without their own printer. To mass produce FDL's, I would like to setup a printer farm and develop an automated queuing system to minimize interaction with the printers themselves. The more support the FDL-1 campaign gets, the more printers I can add to the farm, the faster I can produce new FDL's. 

3D printing is a huge passion of mine and I'd like to explore it's use as a mass production tool. While it may be too slow to produce millions of a product, it does not require retooling when a design changes. Upgrades can be designed and available in a fraction of the time required to create new molds or retool machines. New parts can be customized on the fly and printed on demand. Inventory can be kept low and a product can evolve over time instead of sitting in a warehouse, unchanged for years at a time. I truly believe it to be a huge part of our future and I want to learn everything about it.

When will I get my stuff?
I am shooting for a ship date of September for all reward tiers including the gift tier. This should be ample time to make a few final design modifications, launch the FDL-1 website, release all the files and schematics, get the printer farm setup and print out all rewards.This seems really expensive for a toy.
 
 

 On the surface the FDL-1 looks and acts like a typical foam dart launcher. Why not just go to the store and buy an off the shelf blaster for under $100? The answer is it is more than just a toy. It is a robotics kit. Its purpose is not only to shoot and play with but also to learn from. In the process of building your FDL-1 you will learn about robotics, simple machines, electronics, programming, the internet of things, and 3D printing. You will create something unique. Even if your friend builds their own FDL-1, chances are they will choose different colors. They may even alter the design to add their own accessories or create a skin to make it look completely different.

I designed and created the FDL-1 myself. I received a ton of input from friends and coworkers but ultimately I was the one up late at night modeling every part of the FDL-1 from scratch. I fabricated many different versions of the FDL-1 in a small office in my house. It didn't take a factory or a crew of engineers to make this happen. The whole purpose of the FDL-1 is to encourage people to make stuff themselves. You don't have to go to the store to by the same blaster your friend bought last week. Make one! You don't have to be a multimillion dollar company to create a product. You can do it yourself. The cost difference between the tiers is there to pay for my time and the wear and tear on my printers. It is also there because I want you to print your own. I want you to build your own.
 

In turret form the FDL-1 contains virtually the same set of electronics that a 3D printer does, plus half a drone. 3D printers range in price from about $300 at the very low end all the way up to several thousand dollars. Hobby level drones fall into a very similar range. I chose each component very carefully based on what each one was trying to accomplish. Stepper motors are what robots are made of and what the FDL-1 is made of. They are extremely precise and are immediately high torque without any spinup time. I can tell them to rotate to exactly where I want within a fraction of a degree. The brushless motors that fire the darts are a huge step up from the common blaster. They are fast, very fast. They are well balanced, and I can mount the flywheels directly to them. To top it off, the electronics that control the speed of the motors also convert power from the battery into the exact voltage to power the Photon. Each of these components are very indicative of what you might find in a robot. I've wanted to teach people about basic robotics for some time. The common roadblock I run into is having a fun project to learn from. The FDL-1 is exactly that.

Named ‘CTRL the Robot’, this robot arm looks every bit as impressive at the big industrial robots costing several hundred thousand dollars. However, this scaled-down version is designed to be affordable for homes, schools and small businesses. Created by the in house team at Robotics Evolved, the dream has been to create a whole new category of
desktop-sized robot arms. CTRL the robot enables your computer to perform manipulation of real objects via software.
 It gives you access to technology that has been locked away in large corporations factories. CTRL shares the same DNA as large industrial robots, it has brushless dc servo motors with zero backlash cycloid gearboxes and high resolution encoders.  It is very rigid, has dual ball bearings in its joints and offers sub millimetre accuracy.   CTRL provides a true plug and play experience, it has no exposed wires or assembly requirements, works right out of the box.  It is a printer like experience.  Plug it in and run an application or code your own software.  With code and CTRL you create the future.It’s tricky to describe CTRL the robots unlimited applications, just like it was tricky to describe the iPhone in 2007 or how they struggled to describe the applications of a personal computer in the 80's You can use CTRL for anything from cooking to entering million dollar competitions or even enhance your career programming robots for Woodside.  There are unlimited possibilities that you can enjoy with your own personal robot.Please give us some feedback,  we are keen to improve CTRL the robot and our campaign.
 Online feedback form Download: Press Kit for media outletsWe launched our flagship product prototype, CTRL The Robot at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 17). See us with our manufacturing partner, Jetta, at booth 41853. Jetta is responsible for the BB8, Sphero and many other robotic products.With your support, CTRL The Robot is to be the first of many innovative products for the home and office automation markets.  It is envisaged that the arm will employed as a manipulator that will empower the computer to do real world tasks under the control of software.    
You will be able to use the included 'Motion CTRL Studio' software to easily run diagnostics, visualise movements and script interactively.  CTRL supports all programming languages, so you can easily write your own robotics apps anyway you like.  It will ship with several applications that will be open source for a great out of the box experience. The product will work out of the box with no assembly or calibration required.  Simply plug it in to a computer via USB.  We want to get it into manufacturing ASAP so you can have it on your desk!  To ensure we are successful, we have engaged a commercialisation partner, Jetta.   Jetta is a global company that designs and manufactures a wide range of robotics products.  Recently they made the BB8 robot for the Star Wars movie.  They have a suite of many similar products. Jetta has over 1000 engineers and 3 factories with more than 25K employees. Jetta will work hand-in-hand with our amazing Design and Engineering team.  We are launching our product on their stand at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas from 5-8th Jan 2017.   We are working closely with Jetta to ensure that the product meets reliability, cost and performance targets. With Jetta and other order fulfilment partners on board, we are confident that we can successfully bring the first modern true Revolute Robot Arm to the home and office desktop.
Robotic Arms are currently rare and expensive with few people owning this technology.  They are consigned to factory floors and are used to power large manufacturing corporations. Currently, in order develop robotics, you require an exhaustive amount of experience and knowledge across several engineering branches including mechanical, electronic and software fields. Traditionally robots for the home user have required you to design, assemble and trial your robot in its proprietary software application.   Robotics Evolved with CTRL The Robot will make it a level playing field without proprietary lock-in mechanisms or hidden protocols in software.  We will provide products using the ""great service at a good price"" model.

CTRL The Robot is for all people!  It empowers the home and office by providing access to technology that has previously only been available to a limited few.
All robots require controlled motion.  We use a custom cycloid gearbox design with a pass-through encoder that we conceived, designed and prototyped.We are employing a purpose-built brushless DC servo that has the perfect characteristics for smooth rotation and high torque.    
We are also using the latest field-orientated control firmware algorithms for true digital motor control. By using these techniques we gain amazing power density and performance. CRTL has an text console for conversational control and a high speed binary protocol.  CTRL enumerates as a usb serial device. You can program it on any computer and in any language.We will provide open source reference examples.
So you can plug in and start using it any way you like straight out of the box. How did we determine our funding goal?  
We decided to set the goal at the minimum amount we need to have 100% certainty that we will deliver on our promise. Funding will help us design for manufacturing and production process and mostly the costly engineering set-up costs like plastic tooling etc.  This huge expense is why we are crowd funding.

(I know sending a shit load of introduction letters to those feels like spamming but it is a necessary evil if you get coverage on only one others will follow)And restart it once you gained some traction.And I hope I'm able to buy one then :-D~  It would help if you supplied more videos of the whole of ctrl performing tasks and actions1. So that potential backers can understand how they might use it and 2. because some of the videos look like someone was holding the robotic arm and moving it in the background.3. Providing Confidence in the product dev progress~  Given the current status, the funding is unlikely to reach its goal, do you have any backup plan? I'd love to purchase your cycloid gears and brushless motors with encoders separately as well.~  @creator,What will be the precision (repeatability)?How fast will it move?I do not see statements about the most important technical properties.~  I'll join Andy T in saying a perk of just servo and cycloidal gearbox would be great.~  @RoboticsTeam:a pity there you don't have an early bird pledge for 2 crtl arms.~  Now it will be more costly for me to buy 2.~  Wil you provide a python SDK?~  And any news about the 2 robotic arms pledge?~  I meant (servos and gearboxes), not (servos) and (gearboxes)~  @Creator: consider offering the servos and gearboxes as separate perks (you'd obviously need to post the specs and drawing on the campaign page). I'm guessing there may be Makers out there would love the motion component but have no need for the arm being offered.~  Good answers~  @all you can add more than one item on Kickstarter, or other perks, with permission of a Creator here on comments so everybody knows it's OK to do and if there are any quantity limits, by simply changing your pledge amount (""manage pledge"") and let the Creator know by message (there's a button on the campaign page to ""ask a question"") what it's for.~  Being a 6 axis robot, would it be possible to mount some form of high/variable speed spindle for doing 3D milling of casting wax or perhaps harder materials like wood, aluminium etc??~  Also interested in multi unit purchase including the various heads. ~  Cheers,~  Michael~  You should offer a 3D printing head and laser-cutter/engraving-head as addon here at kickstarter. It will push the number of people who will support your project.~  I second @Alexander's idea for more than 1 arm in a pledge :) and I also kinda want to know the answers to @Andy's questions.~  This is a great looking robot arm!~  Can 2 arms work together with your software?If so, is it possible to make a special pledge for 2 arms?~  Thanks!~  @Creator: It's best to have *discussions* here in the open and have everyone with skin in the game participate and provide input or an opinion.~  You don't need to worry about ""getting flamed"", just answer the questions best you can, and if you don't know or are not sure, just say so -- there are lots of people here, and who will be here, who would be happy to HELP (vs having to build one themselves). You will definitely get flamed if you hide or mislead or fail to deliver on key aspects, or at least fail to identify foreseeable risk areas so people can place their bets accordingly.~  Meanwhile, I think it's a good idea to get cracking on a carbon fiber build, move all the motors, joints, reduction mechanism, encoders, etc from your demo unit (having recorded a video of the exact same dynamics you'll show on the CF one) to keep your variables minimized and to see if some rigidity can be brought into the system.~  cheers~  @Creator: a cut and paste of the campaign spiel doesn't work here. Please answer the questions asked, in detail and to the point, if you do not want to see your supporters' pledges vaporize. Once they form an opinion and go, they don't come back for another look. Others sit on the sidelines and watch how things go in the comments before jumping in. ~  In addition to what's been asked, and unanswered, about envelope etc:~  1) A specification is a specification. You design your widget using the spec as a contract with your customers and as pass/fail criteria to deliver that commitment.... ""desire"" needs to be left in the bedroom. Please provide specification limits that you guarantee to ship~  2) Is the specified load at maximum arm extension?~  3) Please show a video of the 3D printing arm that fully frames the arm and is an unedited full build of a 3D Benchy boat model. It's pretty easy to attach the last segment of the arm to a 3D printer, and zoom tight in order to fake its capability.~  4) The arm appears to seriously lack rigidity. Since you are 3D printing it in plastic right now, I suggest you build one using carbon fiber filament and show us how that does. There is no way you can afford to make this out of billet metal, nor can you afford die cast tooling. Don't make promises you can't keep or go broke trying.~  5) Do you plan to provide CAD models of the arm itself to your supporters?~  6) What have you done for accelerated wear and fatigue testing on the joint mechanism and  speed reducer mechanism? What are your plans?~  7) Why are you using brass, which is soft and does not do well with loads, especially the rated load you are claiming?~  9) What's the effective reduction ratio of the gear reducer, how much holding torque does it produce?10) What happens to the arm during a power interruption?11) Is there any crash sensing?~  12) What controller is being used? Is it open sourced? Is the firmware open sourced?~  13) Is connection to the cloud necessary or optional?~  14) Where are the encoders located on the reducer and how many lines are they? Are they optical, magnetic, or resistive?~  As I said earlier, this comments area is not for fluff, but for our evaluation of you and your project and to get answers beyond the fluffy campaign rhetoric. It's also a place for feedback and advice to help you fit your project better to your end users. Do it right and people could make mini factories with these. Do it half-assed and you are head-on competing with the Chinese, who will eat you for dinner on the cost/profit side, partner or not. ~  Look forward to your answers. You launched (maybe you should have waited if you are too tired to deal with your supporters), so this campaign, not CES is now your highest priority. We'll help how much we can, but the buck stops with you. Good luck  - we are looking forward to a kickass, solid, little machine from you.~  The robot arm looks very cool :)~  +1 on Eebster90 questions, I would add:~  - could you provide some more detailed dimensions (segment length, angular excursion, accessible space description) - what is the robot shell and internal structure made of? (metal/plastic)- What are the gears of the reduction stages made of?- the close-up pictures show hex skews around the body panels, will it be serviceable?- will you sell replacement parts in case one axis fails?~  Thanks and good luck for the campaign, we'll be eagerly waiting for more info on the different heads options!~  Hey guy's,~  First off, look awesome! I am curious to how accurate the arm is, can we get some spec's on things like precision and movement speed and area?Especially for the production techniques you mention, lasercutting and 3d printing and the like, these are very important/relevant to know.Also are you planning a macOS api/programming environment/support?~  Hope to hear from you.~  Abel~  Hi guys,~  Nice looking robot!~  I'm assuming Australian buyers will not have to pay the full $699 given that there is no international freight required. ~  Can you please advise the cost for Australian buyers. I'm guessing somewhere around AU$600. ~  Thanks, look forward to hearing from you. ~  Michael~  ",0,"AU$ 215,000",CTRL The Robot.

21,"GroBotz are modular robots that are controlled with a multi-platform App.  You can quickly and easily build fun inventions with the snap together faces, modules and other components.  With GroBotz you can build robots, games, toys, cars, musical instruments and countless other designs. GroBotz let you learn about mechanics, electronics, physics, software, logic and coding while at play. We want GroBotz to put the power of invention in your hands and robotic control on your smart devices, from beginner to expert, we think there's something for everybody in GroBotz.You probably heard GroBie narrate the KickStarter video but who is GroBie and what can he do?  GroBie is one of many different designs we’ve made and love to play with.  We’ve made plenty of mobile robots and GroBie just seems to be our favorite.  GroBie is made from 2 motors, a distance sensor, a brain and a battery. We snap these modules together with some faces and wheels.  We like to drive him from the app with two joysticks, but sliders, accelerometers and the thumbstick are fun controllers too.  We use the distance sensor to allow GroBie to avoid obstacles and to display distance.  We add the camera to allow him to be driven out of sight, track objects and do complex navigation. Sometimes we add more distance sensors to let him drive around autonomously.GroBotz give you lots of models to play and experiment with and learn from.  As you use GroBotz, you will learn to build new inventions and make fun new Botz of your own.  We have developed a toolkit that connects a great deal of tech allowing you a broader field of play and increased capabilities. You can now make more complex projects without having to write code or be an expert in robotics, electronics or mechanics.  At the same time you will have the ability to expand on what we have built or lend your knowledge to a community of others eager to learn from your expertise.  We’re building it Open Source so you can learn from and add to GroBotz.  Developers can write their own programs, apps and games to control GroBotz in ways we haven't thought of yet. It’s also possible to add new sensors or actuators not yet in the GroBotz kits using our development kit. We invented GroBotz because we couldn’t buy a robotics set that would let us create and control all the designs we could think of. Tons of separate specific systems exist: robotics, builder’s kits, software, hardware, electronics, remote cars, smart gadgets, video games, etc. Our focus was to smoothly integrate these dissimilar technologies with seamless connectivity and unlimited opportunities. GroBotz can connect over 100 different modules ranging from cameras used for computer vision to stepper motors for motion control. The only limit is your imagination. GroBotz allow you to bring common and unique designs to life connecting our modules and your phone, tablet or computer. A GroBot consists of three seamlessly integrated parts. First, snap together faces provide mechanical structure . The second are sensors and actuator modules which provide interaction with the outside world . The third is the GroBotz App that provides control and display for our modules. We’ve packed some serious tech into GroBotz: Augmented Reality games, facial, color and object recognition and autonomous robotics just to name a few. Since we couldn't find a product to satisfy our needs over the last few years we've tried to design one. We don't know how many different designs we've gone through but just the junk ones we've kept fill boxes on the shelves in the shop. The design goals became pretty clear:(1) Build modules that can be easily snapped together and taken apart (2) Modules have to be able to talk to each other and the controller (3) Use readily available devices for controllers (phone, tablet, pc, mac) (4) Make it easy to use without sacrificing flexibility or complexity (5) Create a collaborative community and promote idea sharing(6) Make it inexpensive and keep it open (7) Allow for advanced technology, such as MEMs Accelerometers, Augmented Reality, Computer Vision, etc.The solutions we’ve come up with over the years are called GroBotz. And we've built GroBotz that do an amazing variety of things: light shows, pet emulators, battle bots, musical instruments, traps, learning and memory games to name a few. All from the same simple modules with the ability to interface with devices and gadgets you already own.At the basic mechanical level, GroBotz are faces that are assembled into blocks and attached with connectors. These are building blocks that snap together any way you want. GroBot Modules are building blocks with electrical components such as actuators, sensors or computers and an interface that allows them to talk to the brain.GroBotz use your device as a WiFi controller. For the controller you can use any device that runs the GroBotz App, including Windows, Macs, iPhones, iPads, Android and Linux devices.The GroBotz App has lots of Botz and games to play and learn from. It also has a “wire editor” that allows you to create GroBotz from scratch or modify any existing Botz. Currently, we allow up to 127 modules to be attached in any order.  Playing with existing Botz is as easy as playing a game in any other app on the app store. The App also makes it super simple create your own Bot, all you do is choose the GroBotz module (motor, laser, switch, etc) connect it to the controller (joystick, slider, scrollbar, mouse, etc ) then start playing.  All the modules, brain and controller can communicate with each other, making it easy to change how you control your Bot or game.  When you get bored of flying around with an accelerometer just change the wiring in the App and you can play with a thumbstick or any of the other sensors.We like to add action to our old toys and Legos.  Adding some GroBotz parts makes them mobile, interactive and fun again. Something we have always felt strongly about is the community aspect of GroBotz. In addition to the normal blog and forum features the website will act as an exchange for Botz. Any GroBot anyone creates can be stored on GroBotz.com and made publicly available. This allows anyone to download new Botz whenever they want. Developers will have additional features and be allowed to create and sell their own Apps.  We’re looking forward to working with Developers to make 3rd party apps, modules and games.We are able to keep costs down by using the following tools and open source packages. We intend to make all the source code available on GroBotz.com so that you can build better Botz. These exceptional products have made it possible for us to prototype GroBotz and bring them to you and KickStarter.Raspberry Pi for the brain, Microchip Pic processors for the smart blocks, Makerbot for prototype printing (ABS), Xamarin for C# for control and brain software, Unity for the control interface across multiple devices, Eagle for electrical circuit design, and OpenCV for image processing We also ran into significant cost problems with producing the plastic parts. The normal injection molding process is just too expensive for the product we want to produce. So we designed and built our very own automated injection molding machine. Including designing molds with cores. The injector was built with pneumatics from Automation Direct and we automated it with our own GroBotz controller and modules. We’re using polypropylene right now, we’ve experimented with ABS and other plastics and may use them in the future.We designed GroBotz to be useful and fun for everyone. From beginners with no coding or soldering experience, to developers, makers and electrical engineers. You don’t have to be an expert to dive deep into GroBotz but we definitely didn’t stop at the beginner level.One of the earliest Botz we built was a simple color game. The GroBot was four touch faces on four light cubes. The GroBot controller then selected four colors at random and said the name of one. When you pick that color it rings a bell and starts over. If you pick wrong, it buzzes and says the color again. That was not a bad game for a young kid, we also made it into a Simon Says memory game for somewhat older kids. GroBotz are incredibly fun educational devices that bring all STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education to the student in tactile, real life situations. Students learn about coding, robotics, logic, electronics, mechanics, computing, problem solving and creativity all while playing in a fun interactive way.  Your budding makers will be learning and enjoying it.Yes GroBotz are great for learning to code but if you’re already good or great at coding you can do tons of amazing things with Grobotz. The App has codable objects to allow users to write and implement any code they want.  We also provide a great SDK for Unity3D and Xamarin to allow users to create projects without using our App. We've written GroBotz in C# and are allowing access to all the source code.  Developers can use this to create there own apps and games utilizing any and all of what GroBotz has to offer.   We can’t go much further without starting mass production.  The development stage is coming to an end and the production stage is beginning. Without high volume orders to bring the costs down we can’t begin production. We need your help to turn GroBotz into a product instead of a prototype. Help us bring GroBotz to life.We are ready to gear up for production and build our fourth injection machine to start pumping out plastic. We are excited to get to the next step. We are ready to start manufacturing of PCB’s, new Brains and making new Botz.  We are confident in our fulfillment schedule and we will be able to bring you your Grobotz this year.We care about the environment and we are making sure our production process is as efficient and clean as possible. The manufacturing packaging and plastic production are all earth friendly low energy. Our plastic production will be made with recycled food grade plastics.We are a small team with big ideas. We have plans for more modules and fun stuff in the future but don't have the time and money to get some of the ones we are really excited about off the ground. We’ve decided to make some stretch goals and if we get more pledges than expected we will be able to bring to life some of the things we haven't had the chance to dive into yet.  At 400k we will be able to create a remote block which communicates wirelessly between blocks without having a brain physically connected.  We will also be able to make a solar module that can charge the battery and let you know the voltage it is receiving from the cell. We also will be investigating better wire connections and PCB Production. At 500k we will be able to bring you a 120 volt relay module to turn on and off any outlet/extension chord you have. This can start kids learning about home automation and houses of the future. We will need extra funding to be able make these safe and legal. We will also make a solenoid module to use as a linear actuator for all kinds of uses.We’ve got other plans we want to do once production is up and running, and that's make a drone quad copter that you could put together and fly yourself or autonomously. We also want to make a 360 camera module to see all around at all times which would be incredible for autonomous behavior and human control.",GroBotz,"$5,953","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Fri, April 24 2015 2:19 PM UTC +00:00","With GroBotz building and controlling your own robots is easy.

We played many games, but this one had us hooked.EDUCATIONThe software is written in C/C++ which, according to IEEE SPECTRUM, is the computer language most in demand by recruiting companies. The software is free for you to download, modify or completely rewrite. If the campaign is successful, we will be setting up a forum for you to share your code with the community. We recommend the Arduino development platform. Check out the S4A project too! HARDWARET-BOTS use a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes to precisely measure the tilt. This information is used to calculate the necessary motor response for the robot to maintain its balance. There are numerous ways of achieving this; both simple and complex.The T-BOT has an ultrasound distance-measuring module for eyes, providing the user with scope to write algorithms for the robots to interact with their environment or each other.The bluetooth module allows you to control the robot using your smart phone or PC. See Joystick Bluetooth Commander.Technical SpecificationsCREATET-BOTS have been designed to inspire creativity. From designing your own T-BOT skins, inventing your own games, learning to program using the Arduino development platform or Scratch (S4A), understanding the physics of balance and dynamic stabilization, all the way up to advanced control theory. Or you can just assemble the robot, download the software and play! T-BOTS are an excellent example of a STEAM product that is genuinely fun!     A T-BOT was used to help film the campaign video! The model for the dolly adaptor can be made freely available for 3D printing.The design is complete, we have working prototypes, the quotes and lead times are in! We are ready to go on completion of a successful campaign. Why £100k. The short answer is, economy of scale. The long answer...I’m a scientist and I have three children. I wanted to inspire them with a project that would teach them about science, mathematics, electronics, programming, product design and even explore concepts like artificial intelligence.  So I designed a robot called Robie (see below). When their friends saw Robie, they wanted to know if they could buy one. Until that point, I hadn’t even considered selling robots. Robie was much too complicated to launch as a first product with no infrastructure in place. So I set out to design an endearing  robot that would be affordable for as many people as possible, and so the T-BOTS were born! When setting the target I considered two things. First, I did some market research to gauge people’s response to the T-BOTS. People were both intrigued and charmed by these little chaps, so I new we had a saleable product. Second, I explored options to make them affordable while maintaining the highest quality. This is where the economy of scale comes in. For example, the chassis will be laser cut and the wheels will be injection moulded. When seeking quotes I discovered the obvious - the cost drops significantly if you order in bulk.

24,"Our Arduino Maximo Robot Arm is designed to offer the highest quality while remaining one of the most affordable robotic arms on the market. Its 5-axis range of motion allows for movements similar to assembly line robots. Pledges and Add-ons are in CAD, CAD to USD is around 28% off so 399$CAD is around 290$USD. Thank you.My team and I wanted to create a robotics experience that would be available to anyone interested in this hot and futuristic subject, whether just starting out or already quite experienced. Our goal has been to create a robot that meets our exacting quality standards while remaining affordable. After a full year of research, the result is Maximo. Now we need your help to make Maximo a reality.The kit includes: a black and clear acrylic body with a set of screws, nuts and standoffs, 6x KING MAX High Torque Servo Motors, a bearing base, Arduino with Servo Shield, wiring, USB cable and a power supply. You also get the standard gripper head module, a Robotic Studio license and the Assembly Manual. Assembling the 230 parts of the arm is an easy process. In fact, the only thing required to build the robot is a Phillips-head screwdriver. We provide a simple step-by-step guide to help you build Maximo. Even a beginner can put Maximo together and get it to work in less than three hours.
In order to bring more features to Maximo, we’ve created several modular heads. These heads can be changed within seconds. They were designed to be easy to install and remove.In order to bring more features to Maximo, we created several modular heads. These heads can be changed within seconds. They were designed to be easy to instal and remove.The Standard gripper head module is the head included with every Maximo kit. It works like a pair of pliers, with the jaws opening and closing to grab all kinds of objects.
The Advanced gripper head module is more sophisticated than the standard claw and allows Maximo to grab objects by applying balanced pressure to the object. Very useful for grabbing small and rounded objects.
The Palletizer head module is a miniature reproduction of the ones used in factories and warehouses. A must-have to raise small wood pallets and other stuff.
The Pen-holder head module allows you to put various objects on Maximo’s head. You can use Maximo to draw, paint and even play music!
All parts of the robot are engineered to allow customization. Part sizes are meant to be compatible to allow different configurations. It’s simple to add more features to the arm by fixing additional components to its surfaces. For example, a webcam can easily be attached to Maximo to capture some cool footage from the perspective of the robot.The arm is controlled by an Arduino board combined with a servo shield. The additional connectors on the board makes it possible to operate way more than the servomotors. You can connect motion sensors, led lights and even wheels to make Maximo mobile. The Arduino board comes with Bluetooth compatibility which opens several interesting features such as wireless control from your computer.  The possibilities are simply endless.
Everyone who orders a robot will receive a free Robotic Studio license. Robotic Studio functions with Microsoft Windows only. This software is the result of thousands of hours of development by my team and I. It enhances what you can achieve with the robot by executing complex automations that would otherwise be impossible to do manually. Robotic Studio allows you to move the robot with a game controller and execute different series of recorded steps. You can connect up to 10 robots at the same time in Robotic Studio to create amazing automations.There is a wide selection of add-ons you can choose from to add to your bundle. Several head modules are available such as the pen, the advanced gripper, and the palletizer head. They can be added to your Maximo individually if they are not included in the reward you choose.We’ve worked very hard over the past year to design Maximo. With your support, we will be able to start the production and bring Maximo to the global market. We have already established a network of suppliers and manufacturers for the various components. By investing in our project, you will ensure our current prototype turns into a real product available to world at large. Our goal is to produce 500 units in the first batch.

25,"Spy v. sPi is a capture-the-flag style engineering adventure that puts real purpose to basic design and programming skills. You'll learn to program a robot kit while running your own spy operations!Ages 8-18Spy v. sPi can be played individually or in teams, at home, in a classroom, or a workshop.  In it, each “spy” is assigned a series of missions, each requiring them to write code to control an assortment of sensors that will allow them to protect their “jewel” in different ways, or capture the “jewel” of a competing spy.Spy v. sPi is based on the GrovePi, an easy-to-build robot kit that includes a rich collection of programmable, plug-and-play components — from sensors for things like distance, sound, light, and infrared; to buttons, buzzers and more. Thanks to the GrovePi’s combination of hardware and software, Spy v. sPi makes it easy to connect to a robot, start writing code, and get rewarding results right away. The GrovePi is built around the Raspberry Pi, a small computer developed by a foundation in the UK. This is why we call it Spy vs. sPi.  We’ve developed Spy v. sPi’s missions with a full range of skills and experience levels in mind, so no prior programming or electronics experience is required. Each spy will learn how to program the different sensors and components with step-by-step instructions, all while completing a mission. There are also missions for more advanced spies, and there’s no limit to how complex your solutions can get. Best of all, the entire program is designed by actual spies, so players will face  real-life engineering challenges they’ll solve just like spies do. Spy v. sPi is designed for everyone — so we have two different programming languages you can use. Scratch is for beginners, and is a drag-and-drop programming language developed by MIT. Python is available for more advanced spies, and is an open source text-based programming language. The Missions are step-by-step instructions that first teach you the basics of Scratch and then help you move on to more advanced programming in Python.We wanted to make the Spy v. sPi project as accessible and engaging as possible for all skill levels, so we developed the missions for the Spy v. sPi in both Scratch and Python. Scratch is an easy drag and drop language developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for teaching new programmers how to code. Rather than typical lines of code, you’ll use simple shapes and graphics to program your robot.
 Are you a more advanced spy?  We’ve also developed the mission in a more advanced programming language, Python.  While still accessible and usable for new programmers, Python uses traditional “lines” of code and has more power and flexibility than Scratch. Spy v. sPi Missions are activities in the form of a mission. Each spy will learn how to program the GrovePi and an assortment of sensors to accomplish different objectives, all within a story  created by real spies! See a sample Mission here.The Missions will come in a beautifully designed and illustrated full color printed booklet. It includes space to work on ideas and plan your solution to the challenge, as well as all the information you need to help you be a successful spy. The missions include bonus content available on our website that includes videos and helpful resources spies will find valuable along the way. Everyone that receives the printed missions will also have access to our online portal, including electronic versions of the missions. The electronic versions  follow an online learning style format and are non-printable. A Cyber Mission is an online-only version of the Missions that will be accessed through an all-new portal, Dexter Studio! These Cyber Missions are complete step-by-step instructions with pictures, diagrams, extra resources, and videos. It is not a PDF that you can download and print, but rather will be viewed in a web browser. For this option, it is best for you to have two computers available when working on this project — one for programming your GrovePi robot to protect your “jewel”, and another one to have the online instructions up and accessible for guiding you through the mission. We believe the best way to learn is while doing something fun and interesting. Some learners thrive in a competitive environment, and for them, GrovePi is perfect: you can play in teams or against an opponent. For solo learners or those that want a family game to play at home — some spies might want to equip their room with a spy device or alert them when another sibling enters! Spy v. sPi Missions support both styles of learning!   At Dexter, we believe that at its core, engineering is all about solving problems — and we’ve found that students stay more engaged, more excited, and retain more of what they learn when they solve those problems themselves.  Spy v. sPi challenges students to grow by giving them realistic obstacles they can only overcome by thinking, learning, and ultimately doing — all while running their own spy operation. Spies will learn simultaneously how to program and how to solve problems! The Spy v. sPi kit is not just a bunch of parts, it’s a whole learning system! You’re not just playing with a computer, you’re actually learning programming concepts without it ever feeling like a computer science class. The missions and real-life interactions make the whole coding and programming experience tangible and real.This is the full package!  You get the full hardware kit, delivered before the holidays.  Along with the hardware, you get a beautifully printed book of missions.  The missions are in a story form with step-by-step instructions that take you through the whole experience. You’ll have full access to our video library and support forums.  You’ll get a series of exciting missions and all the hardware you need to run them and kickoff your spy career!The GrovePi Base kit is the ultimate toolkit for building your spy device -- but you'll also need a Raspberry Pi. The main part of the robot is the GrovePi board which connects to the Raspberry Pi. The kit also comes with the following 12 modules/sensors:  This reward includes the GrovePi Base Kit and all of the accessories you need to get started on your spy missions:  A Raspberry Pi 3, wifi dongle, an SD Card with the custom Dexter Industries Software (Raspbian for Robots), an ethernet cable, and a power wall supply. The printed Spy v. sPi missions are detailed instructions that lead you through your challenge, and also give hints about how to code the solutions. Any Backer Reward level that has the printed Missions also includes access to the online version of the Cyber missions on Dexter Studio. Cyber Missions will be available through our online project portal, Dexter Studio. These online-only versions of the missions include all the step-by-step instructions, with pictures, resource links and videos.Sensor mounts help you secure GrovePi modules in place for the missions. Four different sizes allow you a few options for securing your sensors in the right place for your operation. These mounts make setting up modules in the real world fast and easy.  
The Raspberry Pi Camera -- classic spy tool.  Catch your opponent in the act of espionage with a small camera custom built for the Raspberry Pi.

We’re doing that through an engaging series of missions!For the past few months, we’ve been developing, testing and iterating on the Missions with individuals as well as teams. We’ve combined this knowledge with feedback from our previous projects like the GoBox, and developed a powerful, easy to use set of missions that are a lot of fun!

The main expense for Spy v. sPi is to fully develop the curriculum in a way that will make it accessible to spies of all ages and levels of expertise. This not only includes a written narrative, detailed explanations and videos, but also more software that takes you through the whole experience. This takes a team of hardware and software engineers, illustrators, writers, and professional educators to develop.  The result?  An engaging and rich experience that’s educational and fun!Missions will come in a Spy v. sPi booklet, with beautiful illustrations, charts, and space for planning your device. But the other huge component is a new online portal for digital content, called Dexter Studio! This is an all new way to view the Mission content, resource links, videos and more. It even comes equipped with instructor management settings, for folks using it in the classroom or workshops! Software - To really make Spy v. sPi an easy and fun to use project, we spent hundreds of hours designing and coding unique software.  Our software, including a custom operating system for the Raspberry Pi, makes it easy for beginners to start programming and still challenges more experienced users.  Our software lets you program your missions and the hardware in Scratch and Python.  It’s easy to use, intuitive, and eye-catching! We've embedded some secret commands that will make Spy v. sPi really exciting and engaging.Hardware - Most of the reward tiers also involve a lot of hardware.  Some of the hardware is designed and manufactured by us, and some is purchased and bundled as a kit.  We have worked hard to lower the price of the different reward tiers to make it affordable for most spies! Deliver by the Holidays! We’re committed to getting the Spy v. sPi shipped to you before the start of this holiday season. We anticipate the latest delivery being December 20th. Where we’re at right now… All of the hardware and the software are fully designed and ready to go. The Missions are in the final stages, as we are iterating based on our feedback from workshops over the last few months. We have a manufacturing plan in place as well as agreements set up with our suppliers. We are ready to pull the trigger and start production of the hardware and get the missions out into the world as soon as we successfully fund this project!  ",Dexter Industries,"$9,288","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sat, November 5 2016 3:59 AM UTC +00:00",Learn to code like a spy with robots!

It is a complete solution, which combines both hardware and software in a single extendable setup. The hardware part is modular and easy to assemble.Scratch Duino is reliable and designed to work under tough conditions: each sensor is protected by its individual plastic shield that can be mounted onto the motorized platform in a foolproof way. You can easily build a robot from scratch just combining the motorized platform and different types of sensors.The basic kit includes 2 light sensors, 2 contact sensors, 2 reflective object sensors and an infrared eye. Sensor modules are magnetic-mount, allowing for fast and easy reconfiguration and customization of the robot. Up to 5 sensors can be attached to the platform simultaneously.Our robot kit is built around Arduino, which is an open-source electronic prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software.The programming is done using the famous Scratch language developed by MIT. Right out of the box our robot is ready to collect data and process it according to a piece of code you design with Scratch. This makes our robots flexible and interactive.Are you eager to learn how to program code, but unsure where to start? - Go ahead and try our Scratch Duino robot kit. Scratch user interface gives a visual representation to your programs placing each command in an individual colored block and highlighting them as the command is being executed.Our Scratch Duino body comes in three versions:Plywood - a steampunk-style look Transparent plastic - we call it illustrative as one can see what’s inside Colored plastic (yellow, blue, red). Advanced users can dive deeper into programming of ScratchDuino robot kit utilizing Arduino IDE. In addition, two blank modules come with the kit. Inventors can use them to build their own sensor modules. Finally, being open source evangelists we provide all blueprints and assembly schematics for those who would like to create ScratchDuino from scratch completely.
Scratch Duino team consists of professional teachers, designers and programmers, working in educational software and hardware development. We got an idea to create our own robot kit for students and robotics amateurs 4 years ago. We found that most of commercial robot kits are too complex to assemble and are closed source, while we believe that educational software and hardware should be open source. Thus, we decided to start from scratch, literally: we developed our own robot kit using Arduino as the basic hardware platform and Scratch as the programming language, getting Scratch Duino as a result.  We designed the magnetic-mount sensor attachments to simplify the assembly process. Initial fundraising showed a lack of interest from banks and potential investors. They require commercial patents and closed source solutions, while we are open source evangelists. As a result we decided to go to Kickstarter, where we hope to meet people like us. Currently we manufacture our robots at Fablabs and hackerspaces, like Fablab Polytech, Fablab TVN and others. We will continue our cooperation with them for the sake of of global community development.Mezon.Ru is a group of companies, which includes our Scratch Duino development team. We are an international team, which consists of professionals and creative people from Russia and Finland, who work in the area of free and open source software and hardware for education since the year of 2000. In 2006 they started to use Scratch and Arduino in their educational projects, and carry out seminars for students and teachers. The idea of Scratch Duino was born in 2010 by Alexander Kazantsev, an experienced teacher and inventor from Russia. All ScratchDuino team products are free & open source. Scratch Duino Robot Construction Kit is a winner of Google Rise Awards 2013 and 2014.

I built my first crystal radio at age 10... old by today's standards...  arduino , open source tech, nano tech etc and robotics for children is going to surprise people how powerful children are...  why can children learn Chinese or Arabic in weeks?   can any adult reading this learn any language as fast as a child?  and why is that?   this project is poised to help kids create more and faster and more creatively...  open source right?  this means eventually we can 3d print our own components and make them work in our private homes... without even a shipment.. ok.. thanks again.. and thanks Kickstarter for hosting such fascinating projects..  This one might need to re-tool and re-launch, but it's a great combination, a synergy.   blessings~  This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.~  I know this team for several years, that's why I backed this project.I'm a director of Fab Lab Polytech where were produced small amount of ScratchDuino.~  I'm completely agree with Ben! As a father, I would like to get this kit for my kids, especially for my son, who loves to work with LEGO, assembling 9-16 yrs category's kits in his 6. I guess, this would be really interesting challenge to him to get a DIY version and to work on assembling his robot from scratch. So I vote for DIY version, of course, with lower price , LOL~  Hello ScratchDuino! Your idea of mixing scratch programming and arduino robots for children is nice, but why don't you offer DIY kits for parents with children? I think one big mistake that a lot of kickstarter teams make is to condescend to backers. What makes you think that a kid won't be attracted to the idea of building his own robot as opposed to simply buying one ready for use out of the box? As a kid, I was drawn more to toys that required me to construct, rather than ready-mades. It wasn't because I was especially smart. It's because I had good parents who took an interest in my development. So I think that DIY ScratchDuino kits will be much more pupular!~  @The Art Factory - completely agree with you. To use Scratch language for AI programming and to test result immediately is a very cool idea especially for kids education. So I guess, these guys are rocks with their idea. And I like these Russians and their peaceful vehicle :)~  personally, the moment I saw this project it was immediately obvious it's a very thoughtful, cool, useful and very new adaptation of modular robotics, adding scratch and arduino.. I think the budget is a bit high, but the technology and innovation is clear and very useful.   Russia is home to extraordinarily talented inventors... and we see more evidence of that in this project..  yet another reason we don't need wars or conflict between great nations.  let's all just get along and make cool things together!  including world peace.~  furthermore, may I ask you: what is your business? Are you working in the same industries, as these guys?~  Alexey Gavrilov - yes please, send me all you have against these guys, cause I'm a backer and I prefer to know the truth~  Djek - I have all decisions of the courts around this company. From Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novokuzneck. I can send copies to you if you want. And I just said my opinion. And this is your decision - supporting or not. You can found in my message link to other fraudulent project. Cheers!~  Alexey Gavrilov, why are you trying to compromise these guys? Do you have any real fact that would convince they are scammers?

27," Have you ever thought of programming wirelessly ?    WiLoader is the answer. But HOW ????
WiLoader easily connects to your WiFi network, then you can program your AVR, Arduino boards and Robots. It doesn't need any kind of cable for computer connection, especially those huge old USB ones. Because it employs WiFi, even your smartphone can be used to configure, communicate, control and monitor your targets via a WiFi-UART bridge.                                                                                We will publish “Connected Robots” eBook for beginners in robotics. In this book, different fields of robotic engineering will be introduced and explained such as mechanics, electronics and software. Designing robot body and chassis, designing mechanisms and choosing the right motors, analyzing electronic circuits and devices, using Arduino as a brain for robot, programming Arduino boards and designing useful algorithms are some points that will be discussed. With the help of this Do-It-Yourself book, you are going to enter the world of robotics and you will be capable of designing and building your own ideas. Furthermore, the Connected Robots concept will be explored. Contents of this eBook are simple, straightforward and easy to understand and employ.                                                          WiLoader is easy to set up, use and control. Since Arduino is an open source software and  also has a lot of cool features and rich libraries, we will release a software patch for Arduino IDE  to support and handle all WiLoader capabilities. WiLoader can be chosen like any  other programmers inside the Tools menu. It is compatible with all operating  systems and it performs flawlessly.WiLoader has a WiFi-UART bridge called WiCOM. You can send and receive serial data over WiFi by connecting WiLoader dedicated serial pins to AVR UART pins(RX, TX). Just like other COM ports that Arduino serial monitor uses for communicating and debugging MCUs.                                WiLoader is a really good and wise choice when you are working with robots or any kind of portable devices . It can program your boards on the go without stopping and connecting it to a computer every time.You can even create a customized app for PC or Phones to control your robots by sending commands over WiFi. Also this WiFi-UART Bridge can be used to monitor robot status and sensor values. So robotic fans are in for a treat.                                        Nowadays smartphones have become an important and fun part of our lives. Therefor 	we thought why not connect WiLoader to them as well ?! With this connection not only you can set up WiLoader but also you are able to chat with your device via its app. WiLoader app is developed for both iOS and Android phones. 
 You can use WiLoader app’s setting tab to configure its parameters such as scanning and connecting to desired WiFi network , choosing URAT port baud rate, naming your programmer and … We will release mobile apps source codes,  In order to make it simpler for you to create custom apps . So enjoy this smartphone connection and create anything you want. It is going to be an amazing journey. WiLoader is designed to fit on Arduino boards perfectly, so there is no need for any kind of cables or jumpers to connect WiLoader to the ICSP programming pins. Putting them together is really easy and straightforward, you just have to align the ICSP header with its counter parts on WiLoader. WiLoader is capable of a lot more than only programming Arduino. You can use its WiFi-UART bridge for creating startling projects, in order to use all of its capabilities  WiLoader connects to Rx/Tx pins (UART pins) on Arduino too. You don't need wires or jumpers to couple its UART pin; when you put WiLoader on ICSP headers its serial pins will fit Arduino Rx/Tx pins  without needing any further attention or care. Furthermore, since you might want to use shields with Arduino, WiLoader comes with extension headers for them too. You can enjoy working with any shield compatible with your board without any hassle. So in short, WiLoader is designed in a way that you can enjoy Arduino and its shields even more.
                                                            WiLoader can help you reach all the things you desire. If you are developing a product and you need to upgrade its firmware or change the programming but it is too heavy to move every time, if it’s somewhere too hard to reach, if it needs to be installed in a specific spot, if it’s a drone or robot that is too exhausting to catch each time or even if it’s some old design that you just have to update; Well, WiLoader is the key. Because it’s a wireless programmer, it doesn't need a physical connection to your computer. As a result, it can program your device when it’s moving or too far and hard to access . You can even use WiLoader, when you don't even see the target yourself. So, WiLoader will help you reach everything you want and it will make developing quite more enjoyable for you.

                                    These days, we are using more and more accessories and devices and each of these useful tools needs some sort of computer connection to work, mostly they require a USB port. The problem is that laptops and PCs have limited number of ports. As computer become smaller, sleeker and more compact the number shrinks too. Well, now you have one less connection to worry about and one more USB port to enjoy, because WiLoader doesn't need any physical connection to your Notebook, Laptop or Desktop computer. So, it frees up a USB port and adds  one more handy device to use.                          We believe that Open Source products are the best kind. These products evolve and grow a lot quicker and instead of a chosen few, everyone can be a part of their evolution. Everyone has the opportunity to work with them, use them and change them the way they desire. So, WiLoader is following this path too. All of its software components are totally Open Source. The smart phones apps and their source codes, the MCU’s firmware and every other part like them will be available for everyone. Also the schematics and BOM of WiLoader will be accessible too. We truly believe that together we can achieve anything.                    WiLoader uses WiFi for connection to computers, smartphone and other devices. It can connect to any existing network with just a few simple steps. So, WiLoader doesn't stop you from using the internet or anything connected to your network. Also, even if you don't have a WiFi network or for some reason you need another network for WiLoader, it is capable of creating one for you. You can rename its network and set its password. No matter what the situation is, WiLoader is ready to go.                               IoT is the concept of basically connecting any device with an on and off switch to the Internet (and/or to each other). This includes everything from cellphones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones, lamps, wearable devices and almost anything else you can think of. Because of all the potentials and possibilities it creates, almost every company and manufacturer is working on developing and designing components for IoT. But the problem is most of these modules and devices have to completely replace are old ones. WiLoader is designed with a new point of view. It can be added to old devices and projects and give them the capability of remote access, remote upgrade and all the features IoT offers. WiLoader is a way to bring even old and out dated designs, devices and projects to the new world of IoT.                                                                                                                                    In the spirit full transparency we are sharing the history and our estimated plan of WiLoader in detail, so you will know every step we are going to take.                                            
 INTERNET  Connected WiLoaderIf the campaign reaches this STRETCH  GOAL, we will upgrade the WiLoader's firmware, so users can connect to WiLoader and then to their Arduinos through internet. So Arduino’s sketch can be remotely updated using WiLoader and you can communicate with your Arduino using internet via the channel created by WiLoader and PetuniaTech's server.                            If the campaign reaches this STRETCH  GOAL,we will host “Connected Arduinos' Event ” !
In this event, Arduino owners around the world who have a WiLoader, will be able to connect to each other through the internet. Each Arduino fan can find and contact others with the same interests and hobbies.  Also they will be able to chat with each other using WiLoader communication features and will have the opportunity to form new friendships and groups.                                          We are a newly formed group of electrical, computer and systems engineers. Our goal is to break new grounds in Internet of Things (IoT) and create innovative products to elevate the quality of all our lives.  The reason for choosing Petunia Tech as our company name is the reproductive process of this flower. The petunia pollination is quite like communication methods used in IoT and the way various elements interact with each other inside its network.
 We are working in several IoT related fields and have multiple products in different stages of development.                                                                             ",Petunia Tech,"$12,262","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Mon, November 7 2016 12:51 PM UTC +00:00","The new generation of programmers that uses WiFi instead of cables.Program, control and monitor Robots, AVR and Arduino over WiFi.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,213," where is my product?give the money back~  Ok you are sending out updates and links but NO INFO ON HOW TO BUY WILOADER!!!!!

Does this use AVRDUDE as the programming toolchain? If not, will it be able to read and write avr fuses? What about reading and writing eeprom values? What kind of error checking is used for verifying hex files? Will the hardware board files be released as well?~  Hi~  Brilliant and nice idea!~  I have two questions: ~  Which is the function of two pushbuttons SW1 and SW2?~  Any way to put in low power mode, or sleep mode, Wiloader circuit?If Arduino can control trought GPIO, it will be interesting to activate when necessary, saving energy.~  Thanks!~  @creator, thanks for reduced shipping.

28,"After years of development, we've managed to take a bundle of sensors, circuits, motors, and plastic to create a revolutionary robotics experience.  Through a series of interfaces and controls the user is transported and able to see what mimic sees, do what mimic does, feel what mimic feels, and go where mimic goes.The key to bringing mimic to life is the mimic arm controller with patent pending Posi-Feel grip controllers. The user wears a device that allows the seamless control of mimic’s arms and grippers by moving his or her own hands and arms in natural ways while holding two simple handles with trigger style grip controllers. Mimic can also move around on its own power, controlled by the user with an IRS based foot controller. The user places both feet on the controller and tilts the device forward, back, left, or right to command mimic's movements in natural, hands free ways. To complete the user’s sense of immersion, immersion goggles receive 3d video from a pair of cameras in mimic's eyes. Not only does the user see what mimic sees in vibrant 3D, but using a series of sensors and motors the user’s head motion is duplicated by mimic's head, allowing the user to change view by simply moving his or her head. This assemblage of new technologies allows the user to see the world from a fresh, new point of view- that of a 12 inch tall, wide-eyed, rotund little robot. In the words of our founder ""mimic represents a technological breakthrough in think about human interfaces by adapting the robot to the user, rather than the other way around.""The mimic control system consists of three components: 3d immersion goggles, mimic arm controller with Posi-Feel Grippers, and the mimic foot controller.  The mimic arm controller is the key to all our mimic robots, while mimic:play, mimic:social, and mimic:3d also incorporate the foot controller.  video is included in mimic:social (2d TV receiver) and mimic:3d (3d immersion goggles).mimic:maker - Do what mimic does, feel what mimic feelsIncludes:mimic robot kit without cosmetic coversmimic arm controller kitAll electronics, servos, and motorsThe mimic:maker version comes in kit form for the user to assemble. The kit includes a robot with two arms and grippers, as well as a mimic arm controller. The kit does not include a body, however, so the user can tailor the robot to their needs or to make something new.  For even more flexibility, all the electronic inputs and outputs are exposed to be manipulated or utilized by the user, including recording and playback through an on board SD card.

29,"The Cosmoneer Proto is the first hackable robotic spacecraft platform to use off the shelf components and the widely accepted Arduino interface to provide a fun, learning space-like environment.  Space doesn't get any closer than this!  You can program and interact with basic spacecraft systems consisting of Command & Control, Power, Attitude Control and Communications all in a simulated zero gravity environment.Whether for your mad scientist lab or a classroom or a makerspace, the Cosmoneer bridges the gap between your spacecraft dreams and real hands on hardware.  See the second video below for a detailed explanation of how it works.   - Makers and Space Enthusiasts who are interested in staking a claim in advancing access to space and space related simulators.- Students and Schools that are interested in spacecraft, but want something that goes far beyond the electronics and sensor side of currently available spacecraft educational tools, including cubesat offerings.   The Cosmoneer represents high-tech spacecraft technology in a highly affordable hobby scale size.  Nothing else like it exists today.Think about it: there is no currently available affordable tool for enthusiasts or students to take an active role in regards to access to space or spacecraft development.As a civilization, we are going to space.  Question is, how do we get the experience needed to get there?  How are we going to develop and test them before we send them there? Because the Cosmoneer Proto is Open Source, we need YOU!  We need your input not only for design considerations (i.e.- what you expect from a desktop spacecraft simulator), we need your involvement!  Writing code, building 3D models, and most important of all, spreading the word that the Cosmoneer is available and is filling a void that has existed for far too long.And yes, just to confirm, your support will also enable us to buy parts in bulk, refine design and assembly processes, and perfect the end-user product.When we couldn't afford to send a real satellite into space, we set out to design a desktop spacecraft from low cost materials that mimics nearly every aspect of a real spacecraft and the challenges and risks that come with it, but without the high cost and disappointment when a failure occurs.The Proto is housed in a spherical volume instead of a cube. This makes it possible for future versions to simulate full three degrees of freedom (3DOF). However, its dimensions make it possible to deploy the Cosmoneer within the space-faring cubesat standard, should you pursue spaceflight.The Cosmoneer Proto consists of these basic spacecraft systems: Command & Control, Power, Attitude Control and Communications using low cost components, 3D printing, Open Source Hardware and Software.  All of these systems are represented in the diagram below, using as few components as possible. Building upon the inertial guidance and infrared communications, users can team up and experience spacecraft constellations via data relay races and other spacecraft mission challenges.  We can't wait to see what the user community comes up with!   

In the same manner that spacecraft are inaccessible once they are launched, the Cosmoneer is designed to be hands off while providing as real as possible facsimile of a spacecraft in space.Wireless induction power closely imitates solar power, suspension in the yaw axis simulates zero gravity and the string provides a low friction environment.  The micro controller acts as a CPU, controlling other components and systems programmatically.Attitude control is achieved via heading measurements from a compass and a CMG (Control Moment Gyro) that provides inertia and torque, or the ability to turn the Cosmoneer without touching anything, imitating the same systems used on the International Space Station.  The CMG's torque output is controlled by Pulse Width Modulation to a servo and brushless DC Motor speed controller.    Line-of-sight communications is achieved via infrared serial communications, which requires a degree of pointing accuracy and repeatability.  Leveraging a proven protocol based on infrared, called Serial IrDa, the complexities of establishing a reliable link are offloaded to a chip that manages the connection.  By using infrared very little power is used to maintain communications.We've packed quite a bit into this simple, hackable design.  We used portions of the main circuit board as attachment points for the two front support PCBs, should you choose to add sensors or other electronics.Using the Arduino Application, you can program your Cosmoneer Proto to execute many spacecraft missions right on your desktop!Want to do more with a Cosmoneer Proto?  Simply download the 3D design files, schematics or other tools required to help you modify them to suit your project/mission needs.  We've got all of our source files available on GitHub and a discussion forum for sharing of ideas, challenges and breakthroughs waiting for you! We strove to keep the rewards simple and low cost.  We're broken the tiers down into Assembled and non-Assembled kits.  We can ship the unassembled kits out sooner because there is less work involved.  If you want your kit sooner, or you like the satisfaction of knowing that you put it all together, then the unassembled kit is for you!

We've come to realize that a project of this magnitude can't be done in a vacuum.  Space is hard, and simulating it is nearly as difficult.  But the rewards of designing a desktop spacecraft simulator is something we wanted to share with the world.  So here we are.  If you'd like to review the current files, you'll find them here:https://github.com/cosmospioneering/CosmoneerJrIn October of 2014, we were one of ten exhibiting finalists in the Innovation Awards business plan competition presented by Innovation Coast, Space Florida.Gov and Florida SBDC. So, what's the hold up?  You!  The Cosmoneer is a ground breaking gadget that needs users like you who want to be a part of where it is going.  Our initial funding goal is $12,000.  This will allow us to do the following:
 Our vision and commitment for the Cosmoneer goes far beyond this Kickstarter campaign.  Our stretch goals reflect our continued dedication.  Your further support will allow us to expand our focus on the following:
 We want to add Orbital Simulation to the Cosmoneer's power stand.  This will require the addition of a micro controller, a servo and some support circuitry.  This simple modification will add immeasurable to the potential educational applications.  In addition, the designs will be publicly ""fleshed out"", meaning hackers and makers can contribute to the design every step of the way!We also want to develop a full 3DOF Cosmoneer we call the Cosmoneer Evolution.  Staying true to our ""first of it's kind"", The Cosmoneer Evolution will usher in a whole new level of student interaction, as well as a whole host of other uses for a desktop 3DOF experience.  This will require the following:We're very excited to bring our project to you.  We hope you can see from the timeline below that we're in this for the long haul.  Come grow with us and let your voice be heard as we develop products that revolutionize DIY space.  Your funding will go towards reaching the goals we have set forth above.

30,"A team of robotics experts and champions has come together to create the world’s first mini sumo robotics kit and has launched a campaign to raise money for mass production. It's becoming more and more obvious that at least basic programming skills will be essential for future professionals in almost all fields of work. That’s why we want to send a message to the youth that electronic and programming engineering can be a fun and exciting path to choose even for complete beginners!The SumoBoy Kit includes:We have tried out this kit many times in different robotics hobby groups along with electronics enthusiasts and made sure this kit embodies the best mini sumo-robot experience you can get! You can own this SumoBoy kit by pledging 330$!
We have written an extensive digital learning book explaining the basics of electronics and programming behind the sumo robotics. Get started by following the basic theory and practical worksheet tasks and build your knowledge step by step!

 Even if you are a complete beginner, SumoBoy kit in combination with the digital learning book is an excellent guide to the world of electronics and robotics! 
And we will continue to extend and complement this digital learning book in the future to address specific topics such as basic AI concepts and other fields with increasing complexity.
The SumoBoy Kit is more than just a fight robot! We have also included the prototyping board set that serves as a perfect learning platform. It will let you understand how dozens of electronic components - LED’s, resistors, capacitors, transistors, sensors - work and how you can program and control them with the well-known Arduino micro controller.
Digital learning book will guide you through numerous circuit diagram variations and programming algorithms so that later on you can create your own fun projects. 
For just 90$ you can get the training kit without a robot and make your first steps in Arduino programming.  The SumoBoy team has gained extensive experience organizing youth workshops and has made the learning process as easy as possible. We have selected only the highest quality components for our learning set and removed the need for risky soldering processes.Just take the components, place them in the correct spots, connect the board to a PC or laptop via USB cable and you are ready to start programming. The Arduino micro controller uses adapted C and C ++ programming languages, which are widely used in many real life applications, ranging from videogames to consumer electronics. 

Don’t feel confident with your first steps? Remember - just download our digital learning book and you’re ready to go!Robot sumo is a sport - where two robots attempt to push each other out of a ring (in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo). The main challenge and the excitement lies within their autonomy – they are not remote controlled during the battle. And the winner is the one with the best strategy chosen prior to the competition.The SumoBoy team has come up with the world’s first professional mini sumobot that is already assembled and complies with industry standards. The robot kit combines best practices of the sumo robotics team with a long track of wins in all the major competitions worldwide and the best materials available for a reasonable price.
In order to succeed with our goals, we need 100 000 USD to start mass production of our robot kits. Your help and support can make our dream a reality!Our mega reward is specially prepared for the most serious backers (pledge of 5,600$) who are ready to get involved into a real Mega Sumo robot battles.

We didn't win the Young Engineer for Britain for nothing, or reach the finals of Pitch at the Palace.Our engineering expertise and talent has won numerous prizes for our last robot, a wall climbing and painting unit, again looking to perform domesticated tasked and liberating the human from chores. We want to bring our robots into use in the household, sharing our skills for wider benefit. We plan to reach our goal to allow us to run our first production run of our first ever household robot. Thomas.Thomas is the worlds first seat and bowl cleaning robot, which self cleans after use. We've both left home recently and understand now that cleaning the toilet is more of a pain than we first realised. We would either ignore it, forget or just downright hate doing it, and lets not ignore the fact it's not the most pleasant of jobs.So, we worked together day and night to bring together Thomas. We want to share him with you, and hopefully save you some time too. So, what we have so far is a functioning robot. Thomas currently can wipe the seat, and he can apply bleach to the bowl, but there are a few more steps we want to complete before shipping.The plan is to use the money we raise from this kickstarter to invest in the brush mechanism and pay for the further development costs.Things we need funded to make Thomas a reality are:How we will produce:(BEWARE, WE ARE ABOUT TO GET TECHY)The outer case of Thomas will be made using a GRP layup technique similar to that seen in the production of shower trays. This will give a perfect, glossy surface and a strong material. The flash will then be hand trimmed and the edges burnished. The bleach system is largely proprietary, and the tank can then be installed into the outer case using Sikaflex. The track on which the wiper runs is an injection moulded affair, produced by the injection of nylon plastic into a specially designed mold. The wiper and internal gears will be made in a similar fashion. The brush lever arms and rotational linkage are machined on a centre lathe from billet aluminium stock, then assembled using Nyloc fasteners. Their linkage rods are jug bent then connected to the proprietary servos that control their movement. Thomas can then be wired up, using the custom made wiring harness produced on a bench jig, connecting the servos to a PCB hat has been made using a PCB mill. Thomas's battery cases are injection moulded ABS, the cells are inserted after being spot welded together and connected to off-the-shelf control circuitry. Each Thomas will then be quality control checked and tested before being packaged and dispatched.

We participate annually in the FIRST Robotics Competition, a cooperative challenge in which teams are given six weeks to build a functional robot that competes in a nationally broadcasted sports-like event. Even with financial strains, we have been successful in the past using ingenuity over expensive parts: our robots stand their ground against the most successful teams. Our shortage of money, however, has prevented us from reaching the top tier; we now need a financial push to advance to the next level.As a federally designated Title I school, North Hollywood High is unable to support STEM education, making us depend entirely on private donations. Each season, we spend between twenty to thirty thousand dollars to cover the costs of registration and materials. In the previous years, we had been able to meet this amount through the generous donations of parents and donors who supported our team at its inception. Last year, however, we used the remainder of these preliminary donations.The money funded by our Kickstarter campaign will help pay for some essential materials and a second competition.

37,"We established our company Oritha in 2011 with our friends and family members, who have great interest, vision and imagination in Engineering and Technology.
Our goal and aim is to improve the quality of people’s day-to-day life with new, essential and sustainable innovations, without having to change the lifestyle. We mainly focus on finding solution to existing problems. 
Our initial contemporary product was “Naveeno 95"", a semi-auto String Hopper machine. More details can be found on Oritha website (www.oritha.com)  Coconuts are part of the daily diets of million people around the world. In our home, the coconut is one of the important ingredients. 
Since our childhood, we have seen how difficult it is to scrape a coconut. Most of the scrapers are hand operated, which can cause shoulder pain. Some are too small, and some are too big. There are industrial electric machines in the market, but they are too heavy, have high rpm, extremely dangerous, and not suitable for household use or catering services. 
So, we decided to solve this problem and designed the K-drive with the following key features:1)	Electrically operated 
2)	Speed control
3)	Low rpm
4)	Light weight
5)	Table mounted
6)	Food grade materials
It’s very simple. Firstly, you need to wear your anti cut gloves to protect your hands. Then mount the scraper on the table, fix the scraper head to the machine, and plug the power cord. The red LED on the K-Drive will light once you turn the power on. As below image, there are three push buttons. The top button is to turn the K-Drive on and off. The button with (+) sign is to increase the speed, and the button with the (-) sign is to decrease the speed.
Press the start/stop button to start the K-Drive. It will start with three beep sounds. For safety measure, the cutter will start to rotate slowly first. Press the button with (+) sign to increase the speed. You can scrape the coconut with the preferred speed. 
Once you finish scraping the coconut, press the start/stop button to stop the drive. Remove the power cord and the scraper head.Speed We have taken every step to ensure safety of end users. Once you press the start button, the blade will not instantly turn. It will start to turn very slowly. We have designed the K-Drive in such a way that every user can select their comfortable speed and get used to it very easily.Anti cut gloves
To protect your hands we will provide anti cut gloves with the K-Drive unit.
We have been developing the K-Drive for a year now and as seen in the video, our product is complete and ready to be manufactured. Below, we have listed information and details from early stage to completion:Design stages we have accomplished Sketch and 3D design 3D design 1st prototype sampleMold 1st control board First sample injection  Control upgrade  Final productWhat we believeWe believe every single problem in our life has a solution. However, a problem can only be solved by people with creative mind and by people who don’t limit their thinking. 
The technology has advanced exceptionally in the past few decades and is available out there for us. How we utilise it to our problems is the big question.
As a team, we have decided to find solutions to existing problems within our home, and will continue to invent more products in the upcoming years.

It is an innovative and unique space where children ages 5-14 are invited to exercise their brains through a wide variety of computer applications, games, brain teaser puzzles and activities to stimulate both the left and right brain.
 
 Braintastics offers many choices to freely exercise the mind, not only through science and math, but through the visual and performing arts. Children explore in a space dedicated to the intersection of best research and ideas, a place that can quickly adapt to the dizzying changes in technology. Here, imagination takes on a life of it’s own, in the arts, through both directed and self created skits/plays, and personal websites based on student interests and through the sciences, completing inquiry based engineering design challenges.
 
 This is truly a place where the brain comes to play, where students independently and as groups, deepen and explore their knowledge, discovering their unlimited capacities to learn, constantly challenging the upper limits of their thinking. There are many choices to exercise the body, this is a space where kids have the freedom to be mentally stimulated. Imagine a space where research and ideas have an opportunity to take on a life of their own, the sky is the limit for what can transpire within this unique space. A chance to create skits/plays, personalized websites, music/lyrics/books, poems, learn computer coding, as well as engineer and design products. An opportunity to tap into further exploration of any subject or idea will come alive at Braintastics, where the brain comes to play!Imagine children coming into a space where Kickstarter backed projects are integrated into the learning experience. Many computer applications and technology products backed by Kickstarter developers would add so much and be perfect at Braintastics. Children would engage in opportunities, broadening their imagination for technology and play. Braintastics would recognize those products and parents would be aware they can be found in our learning center.Currently we have borrowed technology, puzzles, Legos, and some robots at our Braintastics learning center. We need more tablets/Ipads, robots, puzzles, games, and Lego kits, and as mentioned before, Kickstarter's innovative products, as well as a 3d printer.

40,"Our mission with ORV is to revolutionize the way we
do everyday yard work and chores.What
we’ve done is created a machine that’s easy to use for all ages, is capable of
performing multiple tasks, and removes us from the outside elements. ORV is a remote controlled vehicle designed to assist with all of your outdoor tasks. More specifically ORV uses tank style steering allowing easy control and zero radius turning on any terrain. Using the bucket as shown in our prototype makes clearing snow or spreading rock and dirt a breeze. Having quick change attachments will open even more uses. Never again will you have to struggle with a cumbersome wheelbarrow, or strain your body moving anything outdoors. With ORV's onboard camera you'll never have to venture out into the elements to do your tasks. Every year there are an average of 11,500 injuries in the U.S. caused by shoveling snow. With about another 5,700 injuries from snowblowers. With ORV the user is able to stay comfortable and safe indoors while the machine takes on the elements. In the warmer seasons ORV takes the strain off your body by doing the heavy lifting and hauling. This means less reliance on others. EVERYONE We designed ORV to be extremely easy to use by anyone from gamers to grandmas. Professionals will love the portability to move ORV from job to job in a van or pickup without the need to haul a large trailer. Those who want to remain indoors will love the easy to use controller with its attachable screen to see what ORV sees wherever you are.  In order to make ORV a reality we need to order parts in large amounts. In our video you see the fully functional ORV prototype. Now we're ready for a production version and to do that we NEED your support. Using kickstarter funding to order in bulk also allows us to keep our pricing lower versus if we sold one at a time. Plug in the screen, press the power button and watch ORV come to life. You now have control over all of ORV's functions in the palms of your hands. Two joysticks on a familiar game console controller give precise control of 24v motors driving the large 16"" wheels. Heavy duty bearings and ORV's all steel construction support the weight of whatever you need to carry. A series of easily customizable counterweights allow for a variation of weight to be lifted without the risk of tipping. Raising and lowering the bucket as well as tilting forward and back is accomplished with four electric actuators. The actuators use a quick connect system to easily switch between attachments while giving great functionality (such as a dumping flatbed).  ORV was designed to take on the extremes of all seasons, allowing you to stay inside while working in hot, cold, rain, or snow conditions. The pan and tilt camera lets you see all around you and high powered LED lights mean day or night, ORV will always be ready to work. Based on prototypeReward #1 - $1 Thanks!     Thank you so much for supporting ORV.

43,"The idea behind Limitless came to us when we saw a need for a high quality CNC that was smaller in size, but not small in features. We then also saw the capabilities of the 3D printer and how rapidly it is becoming a standard part of engineering tools. Then we thought, let’s put the two together. Behold, Limitless was born.Limitless is a revolutionary new automated multi-tool. With Limitless, projects and ideas can be brought to life using one of many methods. Inventors and engineers can bring projects to life using the milling machine, 3D printer and other tools we plan to add such as a laser cutter. Limitless is a dynamic platform which is always changing to suit the needs of its users.Unlike all other personal platforms, Limitless uses a robust controller, similar to the ones found in industrial machines. We do not use all-in-one controllers for our automation. Each one of our large stepper motors has its own motor driver with separate power supply. We also provide the largest work space out of any other brand! With a gantry clearance of 14 inches and a table size of 23.5 x 33 inches, we are the largest, most versatile CNC combo tool one can buy! We didn’t like that all small CNC machines and small 3D printers used all in one stepper drivers/controllers to save money. These type of controllers are limited on feature and upgradeability. Limitless uses a high quality state of the art controller that is user configurable. Not all the inputs and outputs are being used on the controller, which allows for a lot of flexibility for the user.                     Pictured, Limitless’s Controller With Limitless real prototypes can be produced! Since we have such a large work area, projects often do not need to be scaled down. By upgrading to our 6 axis controller, a lathe option can be added as well, adding even more versatility to the platform. Also, all of our tools (Spindle, 3D printer and potentially a laser) are always installed on the “Z” axis, so there is no need to swap out tool heads. You just choose the profile you plan on using then, you are good to go!Limitless comes with a spindle vs a router. The main difference between the two is, a spindle has a variable speed control. A router is fixed and usually has a slower rpm. With a spindle you have more control over the speed at which material can be cut and a much higher rpm can be achieved as well. Currently Limitless has a spindle with an rpm of 16,000. The other thing I really like about spindles are, they're very quiet. Spindles are usually found on higher quality machines, as they require a controller and usually cost more. Spindles are standard on our systems. We also include a semi-auto zero on our systems as well. What does this mean? When you have to change tools on the spindle, you simply put the next cutter to be used in the collet, set the zero plate on top of the material to be cut and click the auto zero button on the screen.  The machine will touch the zero plate and enter the values in the software automatically.Another great thing about a CNC machine is its versatility. We often find ourselves needing to cut gaskets. Sure we could buy a laser cutter, or maybe a water jet. But that would be expensive! A better option is to buy a drag knife. A drag knife is simply another tool that is inserted into the collet of the spindle. With a drag knife many types of material can be cut and offers another use for the machine. Other things a CNC is commonly used for is, printed circuit board making, engraving glass and embossing.Limitless will eventually be configured to have multiple extruders. Currently it comes with one extruder, however, the plan is to have four to six, depending on customer’s needs. We also have our own extruder that is in development. With our new style extruder, many types of material will be able to be extruded. Such as HDPE, PVC, PVD and polypropylene. With these materials, much tougher prototypes can be made. Also this new extruder will use powder or granules instead of filament rolls. This means that any prototypes that get scrapped can easily be ground down and immediately be used again with little effort.  Currently, we are using a standard extruder which operates on 24 volts.Another issue we saw with the 3D printers is the filament storage and how the filament can get tangled while the machine is working. To solve this, we simply made Limitless strong enough to carry its filament around where ever it is working. Limitless has storage enough for 4 - three pound rolls or many smaller rolls. This also means, when the multi-extruder option is available, there is no need to worry about where to put the extra rolls of filament.Limitless does not come with a heated bed, but is instead offered as an option. We are trying to keep the price for this high quality machine as low as we can, so we offer the heated bed separately. We feel that some customers may want to buy their own and this may allow for a cost savings. However we offer a heated bed for Limitless, but at an additional cost of $400. Our heated bed is a seamless 24” x 24”, very high quality bed. It is made from heated silicon, G-10 and aluminum.  Shown below unfinished.With Limitless, you get many features that would be considered extra in other table top machines. We offer an extra high gantry (about 14 inches), semi-auto zero, vacuum control, regulated compressed air (controlled by Limitless), automatic spindle control and a large work space (23.5 x 20 inches workable), plus many others.

Designed to answer theory questions at any time in any subject. The technology behind Grapheme allows everyone to insert content inside it and then we proceed with machine training. After this phase Grapheme is ready to simulate conversations like a private tutor.No matter if you are at home, travelling to school, making a break or just few moment before an exam or test...if you have some gaps you can always just ask a question about a school topic and receive instant answer.If you don't have questions but you want to study from zero a topic, you can also do it: guided step-by-step by the virtual tutor!Our technology is tested by more than 1.000 students coming from High Schools and Universities in Italy and Germany. We are testing our prototype via Facebook Messenger Bots. We collect data from a community of teachers. These data is taught to Grapheme and after a machine training phase, it's ready to teach what it has received by simulating a conversation. Our artificial intelligence can learn constantly: every single time that Grapheme can't provide an answer or it provides a wrong answer, it notifies us with that. So our technical team can train again the machine to be more productive and intelligent.Grapheme is available in different languages: English, Italian, German, Spanish, French and Russian. ( We are adding more languages! )We can have different teachers who made the same lesson but based on your grades, school and age we are able to tell you which one is perfect for your needs. Don't you like our choice? It's ok, you can choose the lesson by yourself and read other students' reviews on that.Teachers are motivated to write the best content on Grapheme. Why? Because every single time that his/her lesson is sold, he/she will earn 10% in commission so there is a possibility to have a little passive income.We are looking for funds to introduce the eLearning methodology into the High schools because these institutions mostly don't consider eLearning systems. We want to bring it to young teenagers. However our technology is ready to be used in different realities: from Universities to secondary schools to companies training.Our technology is in constant improvement phase and we need these funds to make this possibile and make the conversation more interactive.Our product is ready to be used but we have a lack of contents.

46,"The RCZTThe Radio Controlled Zero-Turn Tractor (RCZT) is a fully radio controlled tractor that wirelessly transmits HD video to your TV or mobile monitor. You can even mow your grass from inside your own home.VersatilityWhile the primary function of the RCZT is to mow grass, we don't want that to be the only function. The RCZT was designed to be modular so that any part can be easily removed or added. This allows us to make attachments for the RCZT that can extend it's usefulness. One such attachment is the snow plow. The plow can easily be attached to the front of the RCZT, and you don't even have to remove the mowing deck. With the RCZT and this attachment you can plow your driveway without having to set foot outside in the cold.Another attachment we are wanting to implement is a track system. Having a track system would dramatically increase the RCZT's slope mowing ability and allow it to plow snow more effectively. We also have many ideas for future attachments for the RCZT such as a bucket scoop and snow blower. We are also going to try and implement an autonomous package, which will allow the mower to do all the work for you.The RCZT also comes stock with a 2000 lb. super winch and a tow hitch. These features, along with the extra attachments will ensure that the RCZT is not a seasonal machine.SafetyThe Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reports an estimated 35,000 consumer injuries related to riding lawn mower accidents were treated annually during 2012-2014.  CPSC also reported that and average of 90 deaths were attributed to riding mowers from 2008-2010.The RCZT will address this issue by allowing the operator to control the machine from a safe location. The elderly and disabled can mow from inside their homes while watching the live video feed on their television. Department of Highways can park safe distances off the interstate and mow grass with the video transmitted onto a mobile monitor attached to radio controller. Military firing ranges that are to dangerous for people to mow can now be mowed with ease from a safe distance. The RCZT also comes equipped with safety sensors to ensure operator and pedestrian safety. A roll-over sensor is installed to make sure that the motor disengages if a turn-over should occur. The camera can rotate 360 degrees to ensure that the operator can see all around the vehicle and a laser scanner will be used to alert the operator of any nearby obstacles that could be out of his current field of view.RCZT SPECS(Options for Standard and Commercial

DESIGN OF RCZTThe Radio Controlled Zero-Turn
Tractor (RCZT) started out as a project for Robotics Class at Bluefield State
College in WV. It was designed and built
in my personal garage using recycled parts off an old zero turn lawn mower that
had a damaged frame. A new frame was designed using new steel donated by Con
Weld in Princeton WV. The new 2”x2”x1/4” frame was built reusing the
transmissions, motor, and cutting deck. The entire project took around 3-1/2
months to complete. VIDEO
TRANSMISSIONAfter the construction of the RCZT something
was missing. I knew this would help in dangerous locations but just like other
Radio Controlled Lawn Mowers it required line of sight for operation. This
means that the user must follow the lawn mower within viewing distance for an
accurate cut. This is were my team decided to install a video system allowing a
live video to be transmitted to a mobile monitor or television. After
experimenting with several audio/video systems we noticed that blades of grass
are very difficult to see without a High Definition Video Transmitter. Along
with the video transmission we wanted to allow the viewer to see 360 degrees of
surrounding area and installed the camera on a gimbal. Then the RCZT system was
completed.We need your help!The Radio Controlled Zero Turn Tractor (RCZT) started out as a school project for a college robotics course. This prototype was made with a recycled motor and transmissions from another mower, as well as a custom built frame made with donated steel. After the RCZT was completed, we brought it to a number of local shows meant to show people our school's robotics projects. The RCZT quickly gained popularity as people saw it in action. Many people showed interest in the RCZT and wanted to know when they would be able to buy one. It was after seeing the demand for this product that we decided to make a business to sell RCZTs. The city of Bluefield was more than helpful in getting us off the ground. They helped us become an LLC, write a business plan, and even gave us a place to manufacture at. The only thing missing is funding. Autonomous and Radio Controlled Equipment LLC (ARCE) is
seeking funds to start manufacturing the RCZT. ARCE currently has a provisional patent for the RCZT but will use funds
raised on Kickstarter to finance a full Utility Patent. Other areas that funds
will be used is a powder coating oven/paint booth, research and development of
new attachments, and construction of new RCZT (including materials and labor).ARCE already has a 13000 square feet warehouse and all tools needed to start the production of RCZT tractors. ARCE has secured our distributors for all major parts from
companies like Briggs and Stratton and Hydro Gear. With our custom frames and
assembly done in house, savings can be passed directly to our customers. Building
the RCZT with American made products will ensure when parts finally wear out
the customer will not be left waiting weeks for replacement parts.Please Consider backing our project so that the RCZT can become a reality!NEWS Coverage on RCZT (ARC Equipment)http://www.wvva.com/story/31541092/2016/03/22/senator-capito-visits-bluefield-commercialization-center?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter_courtdavis_WVVA",ARC Equipment LLC,$163,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Thu, April 21 2016 11:40 PM UTC +00:00",Allows disabled and elderly to mow from inside their house using High Definition Live Video Feed directly to users television.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,9, ,0,"$100,000",Radio Controlled Zero Turn Lawn Mower by ARC Equipment LLC — Kickstarter

work oriented. We wanted to create a robot platform that was not looked 
at as an appliance, but a friend. Introducing Sopo, a robot that 
entertains, communicates and can play some of your old favorite games 
with you. With the Graphical User Interface (GUI) software, from EZ-Robot, Sopo can easily be programmed by anyone. You will discover that Sopo has capabilities to be entertaining and educational.Looks, stability, and usefulness:We have designed Sopo to have a friendly, inviting look. Sopo's patented
 design enables stability on the canted two wheel system, which is 
inherently stable, without the need for casters, even when not in 
motion. Also, the unique design to use attachments gives Sopo the 
ability to do more than just one task. Some attachments include the serving tray, trash can, light bar, disco ball and fridge accessory.
 More are always being developed and we are always open to suggestions. What can Sopo do?Sopo can be used for learning, playing games, entertainment or, with the correct attachment, even help around the house. We have programs that can be downloaded to your devices that will enable Sopo to play along with games you may already have. UNO and Twister, for example, are just some of the games that Sopo can play along with. Of course Sopo is great for parties and events. Sopo can dance, keep you entertained and if you upload an MP3 into the soundboard, Sopo will play music. Time for bed? Sopo is also a great friend to have around bedtime, with the bedtime stories program for children. Now, all that aside, Sopo can be used for more than just entertainment purposes, with attachments like the serving tray and trashcan, Sopo can be a big help for guests. With the controls at your fingertips, using our app or an app that you create, you can also navigate Sopo to get you a canned beverage from his fridge accessory! Want Sopo to explore around, easily done with Sopo’s explore program. This enables Sopo to move around autonomously and explore the environment while avoiding obstacles, great for serving at events. Sounds good? What’s even better, with the GUI software, it is easy and fun to write your own programs. Great for learning to see what you can have your Sopo do! Structural beauty is more than skin deep:Sopo is a good size robot, standing about 28 inches tall, about 26 
inches wide and weighs about 23 lbs. Even a quick look reveals that Sopo
 is not a toy. An industrial-grade rechargeable battery, fabricated 
lower steel structure, strong plastic body panels, high-torque motors 
and cast aluminum gear boxes assures structural integrity throughout. 
Let's just say we wanted Sopo to last for years to come! Each wheel is 
independently driven, giving Sopo the ability to turn on a ""dime"". The 
center of gravity is very low, which prevents Sopo from tipping over, 
even while going up or down an incline.Safety is always first:Safety has also been designed into Sopo. We all know that no matter how 
many sensors a robot has, there is always a chance that a robot could 
accidentally bump into something. So with this in mind, we decided to 
give Sopo's wheels a limited slip. What this means is that 
although Sopo's wheels grip really well on all types of surfaces, they 
also allow slippage to occur if Sopo bumps into something. This will 
prevent any damage from occurring to the item accidentally bumped into, 
or to Sopo's drive system. This makes Sopo safe around the house and 
more importantly, people. Which is great, especially if you are learning
 to program for the first time!Control Sopo with your computer, phone or tablet:Keep in mind that Sopo is a mobile extension of your wireless devices. 
What that means, is your wireless device, whether it is your computer, 
phone or tablet, is Sopo's brain. Sopo interfaces with these devices, 
individually, using Wi-Fi technology with his built in micro-controller. Be inspiring:You don't have to wait on us for new programs, with the GUI software, 
it is easy and fun to write your own programs for Sopo. All of the 
programs you create can be shared, so be inspiring, create, share and 
learn! What can you have your Sopo do? Specifications:Why are we at Kickstarter?We have worked very hard to perfect Sopo for others to enjoy. We now need your help to finish setting up the manufacturing process, market the product and design new attachments.

50,"Loopy is an adventure into human/robot interaction which brings the latest advances in robotic technology to the dance floor. Loopy is not intended to replace DJs, but rather to create an immersive audio/visual experience between human and machine.Combining our knowledge of robotics, computer vision, and music theory, we've come up with Loopy; the ultimate robot performance that can augment the typical DJ experience: play killer tracks, make you dance, and even bust a move or two on its own. And like a true pro DJ, Loopy adapts to the crowd and plays exactly what you want to hear.Our goal is not to make a robot to sell, but instead create an amazing musical and animatronics experience powered by your own emotional expression and music preferences. We do, however, have some product plans in mind...    DJ Mixer Control Party go-ers will be able to remotely access Loopy via an iphone/android app to crowdsource track selection.     Social Music Integration Data-mining large datasets in combination with facial detection and recognition will guide Loopy in providing the tracks that YOU like. We're going to team up with music API providers and social media to customize the experience to the people enjoying the show. See below for more info on ""THE MUSIC"".    Human Performance Integration Loopy is designed to interact with human performers in new and innovative ways (see the exo-loop below).    Dance Moves The advanced motors and control systems allow Loopy to perform choreographed dance moves in sync with the beat. We'll be working with a choreographer to come up with some really cool moves throughout the show     Expression Loopy is a performer, first and foremost. We plan on adding interactive displays that illustrate Loopy's visual intake from the dancefloor. If Loopy knows he's doing a good job, he'll be sure to let you know!     Lighting Magic It's a stretch goal, but we plan to integrate into commercial lighting systems to provide an even more immersive experience that's linked directly to the music.The video shown is only the beginning. Future iterations will have bigger & better arms, as well as human-mounted machinery. The ""Exo-Loop"" project is a wearable loopy unit that will allow a DJ to accomplish unimaginable feats by combining the powers of man and machine.A large chunk of our efforts will be devoted to the sensor and mechatronic systems involved in each control arm; these are what will allow Loopy to watch over the dance floor and make decisions on the fly. With the improvements made on this technology over time, at Music Mechatronics we plan to develop a more compact standalone package that can be deployed anywhere, an exoskeleton for DJ's!With a easy to use interface, DJ Loopy ""The App"" will give DJ's the ability to remotely control Loopy from anywhere. Furthermore a powerful crowd analytics engine we use to automate Loopy can be made available to any artist.""The future is closer than you think.""Does this sound crazy? A little loopy perhaps? We know what we're doing.GIBSON HUGibson has extensive exposure to the world of commercial robotics technology and is bringing that expertise to make Loopy a truly state-of-the-art machine. His passion for bringing robotic technologies to the world is one of the major driving forces behind this project. He'll be in charge of the designing the crowd-sensing algorithms and helping with various software related tasks.MYSTERY MAN Due to circumstances of confidentiality our second engineer would like to remain a mystery for now. However he is known widely for his mastery in robot control systems and mechatronic design. We will reveal his identity soon once this project hits some serious traction. Or we could pull a Daft Punk and keep is identity a mystery... we'll let the community decide. 
We are avid supporters of open source, freedom of speech, and of course the things we know of as basic human rights. Our philosophy about the future involves a world where robots enhance our lives and make it more rich, just as technology has been doing this whole time.In line with that we do not wish to completely automate DJs and replace them with robots. Instead, the idea is to help them work together to achieve something even greater.We understand that in some ways robots, especially smart ones, can be intimidating. It is our goal that with this project more people will come to realize that robotics can be very fun, approachable, and more natural than the metal parts would have you believe. Their creators are human, after all!We need fans for this thing to take off. Not the spinning type.The robot in the video was a prototype made by our Mystery Man back in Australia; that prototype is currently dismantled and would need to be rebuilt from scratch. Of course, we have all the original schematics and are ready to recreate the design with more manpower and much better hardware. This fundraiser will give us the ability to purchase everything we need to get this thing ready to tour the world. By meeting our funding goal we'll be able to create Loopy at cost using our collective spare time (plus some blood, sweat, and of course tears). Further funding would allow us to invest 100% into working on Loopy full time, potentially bringing in more staff, and expanding our vision to create a more complete experience.No matter what, though, we're making this happen. Please join us in making the next evolution of robotics technology a reality.www.djloopy.com https://www.facebook.com/djloopy",Music Mechatronics,$150,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Thu, March 26 2015 5:15 AM UTC +00:00","""Technology is the campfire around which we tell our stories.""      --- Laurie Anderson",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,4, ,0,"$20,000",Loopy - World's First Robotic DJ by Music Mechatronics — Kickstarter

52,"I plan to design and build a Raspberry Pi based autonomous robot. The robot will be made using affordable readily available materials making it a cost effective project for anyone to undertake. The funds raised will allow me to properly research and develop the robot allowing me to try different materials and tech in order to find the best combination. I have began an initial plan and started to build the ""mark 1"" robot base that will be used to test all of the required sensors and motors etc. The robot will be programmed using Python which on completion will be made open source in order for others to use or adapt to there own projects. The finished robot will be able to navigate around an area by intellegent path planning incorporating obsticals avoidance. it will also contain a voice control function. As part of the human interaction function the robot will utilise several Python Api's in order to carry out functions such as Google search, Wikipedia searching, weather reporting, Twitter and facebook updates and RSS feed updates. The first stage of the robot development will be the initial build. This is the point where I will ensure all parts fit together correctly and are able to be changed easily in case of damage or malfunction. This stage will take around 3 months in order to allow for appropriate research. The second stage will be the design of the program. Various elements will come together in this stage ensuring all aspects of the robot function correctly. This stage will take 3 months with a further 2 months if required for debugging and program streamlining. The third stage will be the testing phase. This is where I will extensively test all aspects of the physical robot and programming, ensuring the robot fulfills all of the original objectives as set by the project outline.

Founder and Shareholder : Stephen de Sa ContoQui gère ce projet? SDSC  SARL  créée le 1  janvier 2014, immatriculée au greffe du tribunal de commerce de Bordeaux, B 799270749 kbis. Fondateur et actionnaire :
Stephen DE SA CONTO  En qualité de gérant, j’ai crée l’entreprise SDSC au  départ pour la réalisation  de prestations techniques d’analyses stratégiques et de management .Mais aujourd'hui, avec ce projet cette entreprise  a  également pour but  la création d’une nouvelle entité dédiée à la fabrication et à la vente d’un distributeur de carte a jouer pour le bridge dénommé ""Jetcards"". The Product / le produit The automatic cards distributor 'JetCards' is a new and innovative device ! It was invented by Jean-Paul Pic (my grandfather) in 1973. It was  primarly dedicated to bridge players that may represent 50 to 70 million people in the world, including approximatively 800 000 licence holders. A first experience of industrialization of ""JetCards"" took place  in the beginning of the 2000's, it failed for technical reasons. Today thanks to new technologies like 3D printers for adjustments and new vectors of sales like internet, the project is starting again!    Le distributeur automatique de jeux de cartes ""JetCards"" est un appareil totalement nouveau et unique au monde ! Il a été inventé par Jean-Paul Pic (mon grand-père) en 1973.
Il est destiné en priorité aux joueurs de Bridge dont le nombre est estimé entre 50 et 70 millions dans le monde, dont environ 800 000 licenciés.
Une première expérience d’industrialisation du produit JETCARDS a eu lieu au début des années 2000, elle a échoué pour des raisons techniques . Aujourd’hui fort de l’expérience passée mais aussi grâce aux nouvelles technologies de mise au point (telle que des imprimantes 3D)  mais aussi avec des vecteurs de vente tels que internet, le projet est relancé. Strategic objective / Objectif stratégique : State of the product / Etat du produit : The JETCARDS prototype exists and works. We can therefore demonstrate its utility and functionality. The patent is valid in France and in the United-States.Il existe un prototype Jetcards en parfait état de marche. Il est donc possible de démontrer son utilité et sa fonctionnalité. Le dépôt de modèle est toujours valable en France et aux USA.Today, modifications are under progress on the existing patent to allow a total control of the industrialization.Aujourd'hui des modifications sont en cours sur le brevet existant pour permettre une maitrise totale de l’industrialisation. Where can you buy the JetCards? Ou acheter JETCARDS ?The product will be sold mainly by Internet. An advertising campaign will be launched through social networks, all  the bridge clubs, leisure clubs, retired people 's home....Le vecteur de commercialisation sera essentiellement Internet un site dédié au produit étant  le vecteur de vente. Une campagne de pub via les réseaux sociaux sera lancée pour faire connaitre le site, tous les clubs de bridges, clubs de loisirs mais aussi les  maisons de retraite seront informées de l’existence du produit.

  Multi-game version /  Version Multi jeux :Once the version for bridge players launched, the marketing of the multi-game players will be developed. The aim is to touch all cards players in the world. A TV advertising campaign can be made during Christmas month for example. Une fois la version Bridge lancée, la commercialisation de la version Multi jeux sera  développée. Le but étant de toucher toutes les personnes jouant à des jeux de carte en France mais aussi dans le monde.
Une campagne de publicité télévisuelle est envisageable aux moments de fêtes de noël.Objective of the Kickstarter campaign / Objectifs de la campagne KICKSTARTER :  -1- New patent deposit taking into consideration modifications for serial product manufacturingDépôt du nouveau brevet prenant en compte les modifications identifiés pour une industrialisation à grande échelle. -2- Creation of a new company for  the manufacturing and the trading of the productCréation d’une nouvelle société de fabrication et commercialisation du produit. -3- New prototype starting from the existing elements and adding modifications from parts manufactured by 3D printers Réalisation d’un nouveau prototype à partir des éléments existant en y intégrant les modifications a partir de pièces fabriquées par des imprimantes 3D. -4- Creation of molds and toolings for serial product manufacturing création de moules  et outillages pour l’industrialisation du produit a grande échelle. -5- Completion of the multi-games programmable version study  by remote control or SmartphoneFinalisation de l’étude de la version multi jeux du produit programmable par Smartphone ou télécommande. FINANCIAL NEEDS / BESOINS FINANCIERS  Financial needs to start the operation comes mainly from molds, but also for the realization of tooling for the production of cut pieces. Cost of molds and cutting come from the study made in the early 2000s, that has been updated.Les besoins financiers pour démarrer l’opération proviennent  essentiellement des Moules , mais aussi pour la réalisation d’outillage pour la réalisation de pièces découpées.  Les données concernant les prix des moules et frais de décolletage proviennent  de l’étude réalisée au début des années 2000 réactualisée.Raising funds to finance pre-industrialization costslevée de fonds pour financer les coûts de pré-industrialisation.  	 CAD software drawing / logiciel dessin industriel/info = € 3 000Developing new molds  / mise au point nouveau moules =  € 50 000Piece of cutting / Pièce  de  découpe/décolletage=  € 20 000 Application Engineer (4 months) / ingénieur application-4 mois = € 24 000 Miscellaneous costs / frais divers = € 8,000Total Amount = € 120 000   Kickstarter fees included   With this total amount it will be possible to start the marketing of the Bridge version. If donations exceed this amount, multi-games version requiring more study will be launched soon and put on the market soon.Avec cette somme il sera possible de démarrer la commercialisation de la version Bridge .Si les dons dépassent cette  somme la version multi-jeux nécessitant plus d'étude  sera lancée rapidement et mise à la vente plus rapidement !!  Strategy of Development  / Stratégie de développement :Based on the product already developed to 90%, the strategy is to quickly create a production unit and marketing for the sale of the product for  Bridge players in early 2016. Secondly, study and fine tune the multi-games version and broadcast it  to all populations who play card games. To achieve these goals, SDSC will create initially within a team structure for the rapid deployment of the project. Basée sur le produit déjà développé à 90 %  la stratégie consiste à créer rapidement une unité de production et de commercialisation pour la mise en vente du produit version Bridge dès le début 2016. 
Dans un deuxième temps, étudier et mettre au point la version MULTIJEUX et avoir accès à toutes les populations qui pratiquent  des jeux de carte. Pour atteindre ces objectifs, SDSC devra créer dans un premier temps au sein
de sa structure une équipe pour le déploiement rapide du projet. 

PHASE 1 Creating a team made of  an engineer in industrial application and an administrative and commercial assistant. The objective of this team will focus on improvements to the new product and determining the components to manufacture the new prototype.-création d’une équipe constituée d’un ingénieur en application industrielle et d’une assistante administrative et commerciale. L’objectif  de cette équipe sera la mise au point des améliorations à apporter sur le nouveau produit et la détermination des composantes pour la fabrication du nouveau prototype. PHASE 2 Creating a production and marketing unit. The objective of this phase is to start the industrialization of the product. It's about creating a team of technicians trained in the manufacture of the distributor, the initial aim is to  achieve 100,000 products in the first 3 years.-Création d’une unité de production et de commercialisation.
L’objectif de cette phase est de démarrer l’industrialisation du produit.
Il s’agit de créer une équipe de techniciens formés à la fabrication du distributeur, l’objectif initial étant de réaliser 100000 produits  pendant les 3 premières années. 

PHASE 3Introducing on the market, in 2017, the multi-games version. The range will be made of 2 products :  JETCARDS for  bridge players and  JETCARDS for multiame players. Démarrage de la commercialisation du produit MULTIJEUX
à partir de 2017 en déclinant 2 produits dans la gamme.

principalement pour but le développement de la pratique du bridge dans
l’établissement scolaire. Ce projet s’inscrit dans le cadre de l’application du
plan pour les sciences et les technologies a l’école, lequel préconise l’usage
de jeux dans l’enseignement pour développer son coté ludique. Le bridge a investi
les écoles, les collèges et les lycées depuis une vingtaine d’années, les 9–15 ans peuvent s’initier à ce sport de l’esprit dont l’une des principales
qualités est d’entraîner aux raisonnements mathématiques en s’amusant. Près de
6000 enfants suivent chaque année des séances découvertes. La cible 35–55
ans Elle s’intéressera à
JETCARDS pour son aspect « gadget » et « idée cadeau». Les joueurs de Bridge de
cette tranche d’âge adhèrent généralement à un club et abordent plus le Bridge
comme un sport intellectuel et de compétition que comme un jeu ludique. Cette
cible est importante car dispose d’un pouvoir d’achat plus important que la
précédente. La Fédération française de bridge comporte près de 100000
adhérents. - La cible des

54,"this is a round the world solar boat challenge.an autonomous solar powered boat has not yet circumnavigated the world so this could be a first. my idea is that i want to keep things simple and reliable and also as light weight as possible. i think we all know this possible record attempt will be difficult and will have a 50/50 chance of actually completing the trip but there's only one way to find out right?.  you could place a pledge knowing that there's a chance of this actually making it around the world and if it did you would know you were apart of it and someone who helped make it happen but even it doesn't a GPS tracker will still work for around 36 months so you can still see where it goes or even washes up knowing that someone out there will find your messages inside. if the pledge is a success and gains more money than planned then that will give me the ability to travel to the boat if it run's into a problem so the higher the budget the higher the chance of success and possibly setting a new record. current planned path.with the idea of having this boat constructed wisely and on a budget the boat will have a simple GPS guided rudder to control the steering to way points around the world. things like battery charging and throttle control etc will all be controlled independently from one another using other systemsthe boats hull will be made from using a sea kayak. there cheap, strong and can easily be modified to be made unsinkable plus self right tipping if the boat where to capsize by giving the boat a keel. the hull's are generally super sleek and efficient which is exactly what we need.the drive train we're currently looking at using is a  brushless out-runner motor geared down to power an inboard driven propeller and run it at approximately 70-120 watts.  testing will let us know for sure at a later date tho.the boat will be attempted to run 24/7 which means the solar panels will power the boat during the day as well as charge a battery pack, when night arrives the motor will run at a lower RPM to reduce power usage and cruise threw the night running solely on the battery's  then when sun rise arrives it does it all over again.. we are also going to do tests to see if it may be more efficient to just have the solar panels power the propeller directly without the bulky battery bank on board   and let it simply drift at night only

SL Interphase- Electronics Design Services Have you ever wanted to learn more about FPGAs?  Looking for an easy platform to learn FPGA programming?  Logitraxx is an FPGA development platform at its core, only with some cool on-board sensors and a motor driver so that your logic creation can drive around.  We'll help you get started with some step-by-step tutorials and provide source code for sensor and robot builds.  Completely open source, schematics, bill-of-materials, even the gerbers.  I'll even provide a basic schematics class on how to read the schematic and explain how things work.Fun Programmable Gate Array, ok maybe that first word is really ""Field"", but you get the idea.  The Logitraxx is the most fun you can have with an FPGA anywhere.  Learn FPGA based motor-algorithms and hardware based autonomous decision logic. Logitraxx is also an ideal platform for mobile sensor-fusion projects.  See the specs further down.  Logitraxx Specs: InventorSpot      RoboticsTrends     Bot Bench     SimpleBotics    Sleibso's BlogThe video above is the Snow Cat in action with its decision logic displayed in a graphical manner.  The Snow Cat does not have a CPU and isn't running any software, yet processing sensor data and making decisions with its FPGA brain.  The Snow Cat's LX9 FPGA is running multiple simultaneous processes.  The FPGA utilization at this point is just 7%.  We are just barely scratching the surface here. If you would like to build your own Logitraxx Snowcat.   You can find the STL files on Thingiverse and print out your own body here -> snowcatthingiverse.Below is a Youtube video of an RC mod to the Snowcat.  It switches in and out of autonomous mode to RC mode by remote control.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYuB_UQ4jIYAbove is the Logitank running some basic obstacle avoidance with on-board IR sensors.  Just like the Snowcat, the Logitank relies on the FPGA for its drive algorithm and turret control and does not run any software.  You can build your own Logitank with the Logitraxx chassis by downloading the Tank body STL files and  printing them yourself here -> tankthingiverseField Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.  You can reprogram the Xilinx Spartan 6 as often as you like, constantly redesigning its functionality and capability. Watch the Sonic Tank in action on Youtube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnlI4pMppEkCan I drive the Logitraxx features and I/O from Arduino?Yes, you can.  You can access any I/O and control system on-board with your Arduino or any other microcontroller based system for that matter.  Or you can off-load some duties to hardware (FPGA) while keeping other control functions in the hands of your Arduino.  Use the FPGA to accelerate features in hardware that the Arduino may struggle with, similar to the way a modern PC relies on its external graphics card to handle hardware acceleration of 3D graphics.  Allow the two to work together while you learn more about FPGAs.  We'll have plenty of sample code for you to look at.See the ""Tech Talk"" video above for a more detailed explanation of the differences between FPGAs and CPUs and why an FPGA can get things done faster and more efficiently. Using the FPGA as the brain has a clear advantage over software based autonomous robots. Are there advantages to using an FPGA?Yes plenty, an FPGA based system can be very small and low power and yet have extreme amounts of computational horsepower. FPGAs can execute computational tasks in just 1 or 2 watt solutions that would require a traditional CPU/Software based system consuming hundreds of watts of power to duplicate.  Since there is no software to crash, an FPGA based robot is extremely reliable executing its programmed tasks without stopping for months, even years (with the appropriate power source) and never needs a reboot. Being field re-programmable makes them perfect for hardware design changes at the circuit board level without having to redesign the circuit board itself. This gives an FPGA very distinct design function upgrade possibilities while remaining in-the-field and without ever lifting the hood.A little more background on FPGAsIf you've ever worked in a company that engineers its own embedded or industrial products, you may be familiar with a world of components virtually unknown to the maker/hobbyist world.  Many hobbyists are programmers with a good working knowledge of C and those systems often require operating systems, drivers, and application layers, all of which saddle an already overwhelmed micro to duties that have little to do with their project, but are needed as the foundation layer prior to making their gadget to perform even the simplest task.But that wasn't always so.  Before the days of the microprocessor, many electronic gadgets relied on straight forward logic components to process data and control the I/O.  As the microprocessor became more mainstream, more and more logic was pulled into software and controlled by the CPU.  Today, to perform something as simple as an “AND” operation between two input signls can sometimes require tens of thousands of lines of OS/Application layer to be installed first!The world of logic driven devices hasn't gone away though.  They've been busy in the realm of programmable logic devices like PLDs and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array).  Quietly evolving in the background operating in electronic devices rarely seen by the average consumer all while the modern day CPU/Software structure reigned in the consumer electronics market.  And so today's FPGA is incredibly sophisticated with internal reconfigurable RAM blocks and DSP slices that you can assemble like silicon legos into some very powerful hardware.A properly configured FPGA can accelerate sensor and decision processes hundreds of times faster than most traditional CPUs. The difference is in the inherent design of the CPU.  Its designed to perform tasks ""sequentially"", one-at-a-time whereas the FPGA can be configured to perform many tasks at once.  FPGAs also work great has companion silicon to CPU based systems helping to off load redundant functions where they can be performed more efficiently.  This is the configuration most often implemented.Note on Shipping:I will ship this product international for a $25.00 fee, however I will not ship to any country who is currently on the US embargo ban list, nor will I ship to any country currently engaged in a civil war.

Schematic and board drawing information will be provided at product release.A tracked robot is a great way to learn how to program with an FPGA.  The Tamiya Vehicle Chassis Kit makes a great starting platform since it is not complex electrically, but includes the basic mechanicals to build out your robot. It has the motor and gearbox, but there is not much definition beyond a battery and switch. Our mock-up was literally drawing out where components could be placed on the wood chassis that comes in the kit. Stage 1: Grease Board Block Diagram Stage 2: Component Placement Planning Stage 3: Design Phase, Final Dimension Check Stage 4: Prototype PCB Fab and Component Assembly",Shane Lewis,"$4,910","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Mon, August 25 2014 6:09 AM UTC +00:00",Discover a new way to build robots with this highly configurable tracked robot kit built around the Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,32," Yes it is disappointing but I backed Logitraxx twice because I believed and appreciated what you were doing & for my own self edification.

Anyway, I hope to hear of your future launches. Regards & best wishes.~  It is a darn shame that it was not funded, Shane.  It is still a great project.  Let us know what you do next.~  Daniel~  Hi Shane. What I love about this project is that it is specifically about a FPGA and not a CPU-based environment. This is mainly due to my own research interest which argues that design of controllers for things that somehow parallel bioligical organisms should be done differently from conventional CPU-based programs. I mean, your platform can be seen as a mobile machine or autonomous tool, but it can also be seen as an artificial creature that needs an artificial brain based on biological brain concepts for its design.In fact, I don't promote VHDL as opposed to C programming because I believe any artificial brain design should be based on some form of modelling that works at a level of abstraction such that the same design can be executed in an FPGA or microcontroller. It is from a research point of view just more interesting to work with an FPGA basis which would force the designer to not think in conventional programming terms.Of course, by this I am promoting my own research field and currently I can only speak for myself. I do not know of many others agreeing with me. In any case, within this world of mine, the designer of the system would not need to learn VHDL, nor C language in the CPU case, since the design environment will look like LabView or the Lego Mindstorms graphical interface.Thus, in that case, what would then be the benefits of an FPGA-based vs a CPU-based platform? In addition to forcing someone to think outside the CPU-based programming box, I guess it will come to down to performance, that an FPGA-based solution outperforms the CPU version, but only if power considerations are taken into account. An FPGA is normally quite power hungry compared to microcontrollers. And also it would be easier to find third-party features such as wireless drivers. So, tools will be an issue.~  So my interest in your wonderful project is personal and I am sure will not motivate many to also use your platform at the moment. Maybe in that sense the main reason for using your product would be to make learning VHDL more fun! That is, wherever they teach VHDL across the world.~  Just some thought I had and wanted to share...~  Paul~  All good ideas, Shane.  Personally I think it is better to make things like a CPU board or Bluetooth available in a follow-on board or release.  ~  For instance, the LEGO SmartBrick project had a base goal to build a flat brick, and then there are several stretch goals that add more capability.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sbrick/sbrick-smart-way-to-control-all-your-lego-creation~  OK, so there are less than three weeks to go.  What do we need to do to see this project move forward?  Every ASIC/FPGA engineering college student would love to have one of these, they just can't afford it.  Not that they would think it is overpriced for what they are getting: they just don't have it.~  So who does have the money, is interested, but is sitting on the fence for other reasons?  Working engineers who would love to have one in their home or office but are afraid of what it will take to get it running or what other people will say?~  I don't think it is feature poor, it just needs to capture someone's attention.  What if you could buy different tops that assisted different tasks.  Like a coffee carrier so I could send it to the kitchen to wait until someone comes into the room and then ask them for half a cup of coffee, which it would bring back to my office.  Or maybe a mobile phone carrier which I could connect to with Facetime and then activate a search algorithm to go find the dog, kids or wife so I could say something to them without getting up.  Or maybe a tall poll to hold a movie or still camera, move around during a party and take photos and short movies so you put together a highlights video afterwards.~  There must be other cool ideas about what you can do with a Logitraxx that would capture a supporter's interest.~  I guess the big concern for backing this project are:People are afraid of the new language. There are really few, easy tutorials out there. Your project is a toy, so something to learn with. If you could offer a step-by-step tutorial for fpgas, it would encourage people to pledge. I would even go as far as saying this is the main thing, you want to do. ""And hey! By the way! I've got a great piece of technology here! With that one you could train your new skills: The Logitraxx!""~  But you asked for shields.How about a dual NTSC Camera Shield or something like this. This would give a more advanced way to control the robot.And another one: Something wireless. Bluetooth or WLAN.~  ",0,"$42,000",Logitraxx Tracked Robot Kit by Shane Lewis — Kickstarter

57," Our visionWe saw an opportunity for a device that incorporates 3 main ideas: it should be social, entertaining and delicious. After discussing several ideas, the holy grail of robotics was revealed to us in a flash of insight: we would strive to create a robotic cocktail-mixing bar. 
Not just any automated cocktail bar of course, because some were already available at the time. We wanted something that could serve as a focal point at parties, something that was impressive to look at and showed the party crowd the wonders of technology. It should not only focus on functionality and serve delicious cocktails, it should also be aesthetically pleasing and be the talk of the party. To achieve this we focused on moving parts and purposefully left components and wires visible.The idea behind our vision came to us several years ago. It was a magical evening during which anything was possible. As we discussed the evolution of society, technology and human interaction, we realised that open hardware platforms are a core component in this process. All we needed then was a good idea, and that evening provided the spark that started a revolutionary fire. As such, we expanded on the idea until we came up with Winston: a cocktail bar centered around a robotic arm that uses dispensers to take shots from bottles - just like a human bartender - and mixes those shots in the drink you ordered.Showcase: Winston v1 (click to enlarge)Winston v1 features:  Winston v1 before some hardware and software updates:

The best part is we're making our complete plans and build guides available to the public, so you can build one too! We're taking on the technical risk now to prove out the design in practice, so it will be much easier for you to build yours.
Good question! Look at nature. Can you name any animal that moves using wheels? Legs are the best solution for traversing extremely rough terrain, and nature figured this out long ago. A legged machine gives us the ability to travel where no wheeled machine could ever go. This means there are innumerable uses for a walking robot like the Mk I including serious uses like search and rescue, construction, forestry, and defense, to more playful uses like off-roading and mecha sports (combat robot dueling).A tremendous amount of research has been invested in walking machines in the last 15 years, and great strides have been made. But legged machines are still way too expensive for most people to get a hold of, and they are relegated to the research lab, so we intend to change that. Our design is specifically cost-conscious and low-complexity, and meant for the real world - not a research lab. Our goal is to make this build accessible to an average mechanically-inclined person with a reasonable budget, so that everyone can enjoy the fun and excitement of legged robots like we do. We can even envision selling kits if there's enough interest (stretch goal). So let us know how cool you think this is by supporting us here on Kickstarter!From Robotech to Pacific Rim, Transformers to MechWarrior Online, our team shares a love for giant robots. The unique coolness factor of walking robots such as the Imperial walkers on Hoth, Ripley fighting the Alien Mother, and innumerable Saturday morning cartoons, have long captivated audiences young and old. We live in a world of increasing virtual experiences, but with this project, our team makes the virtual a reality.Supporting this Kickstarter demonstrates public interest in walking vehicles for entertainment and recreation. Since we will be making our final Mk I design available to the public, we encourage other builders and hopefully even grassroots walking robot competition leagues. A successful campaign allows us to demonstrate our robot building skills. Of course, the lessons learned during the build apply directly to the larger follow-on efforts of the larger Mark II, and the more complex Mark III.Absolutely! We took great pains to have a realistic design concept, opting for a quadruped body shape to maximize stability without sacrificing speed. We anticipate speeds around 15mph on most terrains, while remaining very hard to topple. We elected to reduce our project risks by reconfiguring construction equipment for walking limbs, reducing build time and component cost. Our team dedicated the next few months to focus on the Mark I build exclusively, no side projects, no distractions. Maximum effort.We feel confident in our design due to extensive experience. Our team members spent years working on mobile hydraulic robotics at Boston Dynamics, honing our craft by designing and implementing major systems on Big Dog, LS3, Wildcat, Cheetah, Petman, DRC-Atlas, and Next Generation Atlas among others.Click here to check out the awesome robots we worked on!This Kickstarter is a true kick start, helping to get the ball rolling for the Big Dig Mk I. At a budget of $80,000 we can get the build done in three working months.

Pliny: ""Giant mecha once strode the earth alongside dinosaurs and dragons, only to fade into obscurity - but they never disappeared altogether.""Pliny: ""Mankind spent great effort to rediscover these ancient titans - Columbus sought them as did the Pilgrims. The American Colonies broke away to find them. It wasn't until Boston's so-called Big Dig Construction Project - itself an elaborate conspiracy concealing the hunt - that the discovery was finally made. A crew stumbled upon an ancient egg chamber quite by accident. Inside they found a delicate mechanical life-form in deep hibernation.""Our team adopted the Little Dig and with your help we will nurture it and guide its growth so it can one day take its place on the world stage.Here are some examples of our rewards. Also, be sure to check out the Big Dig Loyalty Club - we'll never forget those folks who supported us from the start!      Big Dig Loyalty Club Membership Our Mk.

62,"The DynamixShield is an electronics board that fits onto an Arduino Due microcontroller to give you the ability to control Dynamixel smart servos and regular servos, while also providing numerous Grove and RobotGeek connectors. Grove and RobotGeek are hardware frameworks for modular sensors and actuators. There are tons of off-the-shelf modules for these two frameworks that can be plugged into the shield with a single cable. This includes everything from GPS sensors, RFID scanners, and LCD displays that are plug-and-play ready for use with the shield. This makes it very easy to build your robots by combining modules and servos.Building robots is hard! You have to know a lot about a variety of different hardware systems, understand how to program them, and how to integrate all the parts together so it works as intended. Most of the work I do involves the use of smart servos. There are a few boards out there that let you control smart servos, but I really needed to use the newer, more powerful 32-bit Arduinos for my robots. When I started this project there was nothing on the market that would work with the newer systems and provide the control I needed. 

It was also important that I be able to quickly and easily use existing sensor modules. Why re-invent the wheel? It's so much easier to plug in a single cable and have an XBee wireless system ready to go, or integrate in a GPS module. What I really needed was a shield that combined these capabilities. So the idea behind the DynamixShield was born. It solves these issues, and makes it much easier to build robots in a modular fashion.An issue I encountered while working with the newer Arduinos is that they are 3.3V systems, and are not 5V tolerant. So you cannot just plug sensors or actuators into them like you could with the older Arduino Uno or Mega, because it would fry your board. So if I wanted to use those more powerful processors I would also need a way to make it work with existing 5V systems.The DynamixShield solves this problem by using high speed, bi-directional level shifters for a number of the Due's signal lines. This allows it to convert between 3.3 and 5 volts. The shield has a jumper that lets you power the Vin of the Arduino from your shield. This means you can power the shield, motors, and Arduino from a single battery cable if you want. The shield even comes with re-settable PTC fuses to help prevent damage to your board in case there is an accident and you try to draw too much power.

Since the DynamixShield uses stackable headers, the regular Arduino Due signal connectors are still available for use, including the SPI lines.It also has circuitry for converting one of Arduino's regular serial lines into the half-duplex protocol required to communicate with Dynamixel smart servos. Each smart servo connection has a jumper that lets you control whether it is powered from the shield, or from an independent supply on a hub. While the DynamixShield is capable of supporting large current draws, and has been tested with 21 Dynamixel servos, the jumpers are a really cool feature that gives you the option of distributing the power supply for your servos among several hubs instead. 

In addition, it has numerous Grove connectors, and standard 3-pin headers for regular servos and RobotGeek modules.

Here is a complete list of its features:This is a small video overview of the Dynamixel showing all of its features.The sky is the limit, but here are a few things that I have done. I will be adding more videos demonstrating these features, and how to use them, during the Kickstarter campaign.Control Dynamixel AX smart servos.Synchronous control of Dynamixel smart servos. Control Dynamixel XL smart servos.   Control a Phantom hexapod robot. Build a probing robot with a gripper arm.Check out this Instructable that shows how to build a 5 degree of freedom robot arm!Build a 5 degree of freedom (DOF) robot arm with pressure feedback.Check out this Instructable that shows how to build a 5 degree of freedom robot arm! Control DC motors using a Grove H-Bridge module.Control regular servos. Play R2-D2 sounds using a Grove MP3 player.Wireless serial communication between two Arduinos using a Grove XBee module. Use RobotGeek modules. How do I use it?Using the Grove and RobotGeek modules is almost effortless. Simply plug the cable from your module into the shield and use the example sketch provided for that module by the manufacturer. That's all there is to it. I have provided several example sketches in the project repository.To control smart servos you simply need to install the supplied library and use it to communicate with the servos. It provides methods for sending movement commands to any of the servos in your network, and for reading back important feedback information from them, such as their current position, velocity, load, and temperature. The library and sketches are available in the project repository. At the moment it works fully with AX and MX servos, but only has limited functionality for XL servos. I plan to refactor the library to work seamlessly with any of these servos as part of this Kickstarter if the XL cable stretch goal is reached. Please look through some of the videos listed above for more details on how to control the servos.We want the DynamixShield to be an ongoing project, and to do this we need strong feedback from the community. The best way to get this is to make the entire project Open Source. Once the Kickstarter has been completed, all hardware design and software files will be released as a Git repository to the public. The software libraries and examples are available now at https://github.com/NeuroRoboticTech/DynamixShield. So if you want to implement the DynamixShield software or hardware in your own project you can. This repository will include:   I have now gone through several iterations of the DynamixShield to work out the kinks, and streamline the features. I originally ordered the bare boards from SeeedStudio and built them by hand. After some extensive research I chose a manufacturing company (OurPCB), and have been working with them to optimize the parts selection to reduce cost and part count. I recently had them produce a batch of bare boards and I assembled some shields by hand using the new parts to make sure everything fits and still works great. However, the only way you can economically produce electronics at the moment is to build it in bulk. So I need to have orders for at least 100 boards to be able to produce them at a competitive price. That is where I need your help. If you are excited about all of the cool features of this board and would love to have one then please support this project so we can get the first production run of the boards completed. Here are the rewards that are available. Shipping is extra and will be $6 USD for shipping within the US, and $20 USD for shipping elsewhere in the world.We have two stretch goals that are really cool.

 $7,000: XL converter cable.
The Dynamixel XL is a much smaller smart servo than the other AX and MX versions. It also uses a newer communications protocol, and most importantly, it has a smaller cable connector. The underlying wiring is identical, but the connector itself is different. This means that you cannot simply plug-in an XL servo into the AX/MX connector that is on the DynamixShield. However, you can build a converter cable by hand and use the shield to control the XL servos. This is a bit of work though. To make things simpler I have been working with a major, global cable manufacturer to get estimates and test samples of a converter cable. Below are some images of the sample cables they produced. They work great and allow you to plug your XL servo directly into the DynamixShield and control it. If we can reach this stretch goal of $7000 then I will have these cables produced and include one cable for each reward that contains a DynamixShield. I will also re-factor the current DynamixSerial library to make it work fully with all three different servo types, AX, MX and XL.

$8,000: Modify PyPose and Nuke to work with the DynamixShield
The Nearly Universal Kinematics Engine (NUKE) is an easy to use PyPose tool that creates a customized Inverse Kinematics solution and gait engine for robots. It works for most popular configurations of quadrupeds and hexapods. PyPose is a python tool that captures poses and generates the Nuke code. Currently these tools only work with the Arbotix controller. If we can reach this stretch goal of $8,000 then I will modify these tools so they work with both the Arbotix and DynamixShield. These are very powerful tools, and having them support Dynamixshield will be a really awesome addition. Here is an overview of the budget for this project. We were concerned about setting the project goal too high, so we decided to cover some of the costs ourselves to make it more likely we could attain the funding. It will be important for us to try and reach the stretch goals if possible to recoup as much of that as possible. My primary area of interest is building intelligent, adaptive robots by using what is known about how the brains of real animals work. To do this, I emulate the brains of insects using either deep neural networks (DNN), or more biologically realistic spiking neural networks (NN). These neural nets run in parallel on a GPU. I am focusing on getting this all running on the NVIDIA Jetson TK1 or TX1. The Jetson is a small, embedded computer with a powerful CUDA core that is perfect for vision processing and nerual networks. However, interfacing the Jetson with other robotic components is still a bit of a challenge. Producing the DynamixShield is my first step towards making it easy for anyone to build robots with the Jetson. I plan to combine the DynamixShield together with some interface circuitry to produce a new product called the Jetduino. This new board will fit over the Jetson and have Grove and RobotGeek connectors for interfacing directly to its GPIO lines, or you can use an Arduino Due and the integrated DynamixShield as a bridge between the rest of your robot and the massive CUDA processing available on the Jetson. First though, I need to get the DynamixShield out there and field tested!    I also have versions of the DynamixShield designed for the Arduino Mega and the newer Zero. However, before going any further with those I want to see what the demand is for this version. If you would be interested in either of these in the future then please let me know!If you still have other questions, you can post a comment or send an email to me at: dcofer@NeuroRoboticTech.com

63,"My goal here is to build and market a budget robot arm for smaller company's.  In order to be more competitive, small company's must auto mate to compete with larger corporations. Right now the cost is just to high to have a real chance. So i invented my Sexy Six Axis Robotic Arm. I want to provide a quality low cost solution to system automation. For example the cost for a ready to use system with the same abilities would be over $10,000.00. And that does not include Site preparations that's just the robot cost. Our system complete delivered would cost only $5,000.00 ready to work right out of the box. runs on 110 volts ac, and 120 lbs of air pressure. This will allow small shops and company's to either build there own robot arm from plans and software, or buy a kit to assemble, or finally to purchase the unit ready to go, no assembly required. We want to offer the plans for 100.00 for the robot arm, and if you want software 500.00A kit would be 3000.00 you just follow the how to video and instruction manual and save even more. If you don't have time you can purchase the whole enchilada for 5000.00 plus shipping.As you can see from the video we are already testing the advanced prototype all that is needed is work on the software, add minor changes to the looks to make it more appealing, and tool up for production with some refinements that we have already identified. The robot will have some very advanced features such as Vision for locating parts or object for pick and place. Lifting capacity will be over 40 lbs. The ease of manufacturing  the robot components and the ability to modify the robot to suit your needs, will make this a very appealing robotic arm.The arm is sectional so you can add different length arm segments for unique or varied operations.

64,"Once upon a time a child scanned the internet to find a zero turn air conditioned lawnmower. A fabrication company had built one for a customer and put pictures of it on the internet. It must've cost that guy $10,000.00 in labor alone. A few years later an internet search reveals a guy opened a business in the UK selling small zero turn air conditioned lawnmowers. When asked about price it was over $50,000.00. This was for a basic no name brand commercial zero turn lawnmower with a cab and air conditioning! Well that was way out of that teenagers price range. So moving along, the guy makes one. This thing was built hardcore and heavy duty taking years of engineering. It even had internal fans, a heater for the fall and winter, and even a place to mount a tv!That teenager is now a 31 year old man. He is selling the lawnmower now in a better looking manufactured version, brand new.We pretty much buy a brand new commercial mower dealer cost. We install the frame custom built for the lawnmower. It is not a universal frame. The frames are made on a jig and every frame is the same. Next we put a giant alternator with custom brackets onto the lawnmower, along with the custom 1/8"" thick aluminum frame and the 3/16"" thick lexan side panels.Then the air conditioner is installed. It is an 8000 btu window unit built and tested to last thousands of hours. A thermostat connected to a heater keeps you comfortable in the cold season.The frame that goes on top of the mower (cab) is all brand new and built at a medical equipment manufacturing facility. It is designed to be strong enough to handle a rollover, and be able to hit small tree limbs without damaging the frame. The frame has been tested extensive and found able to break 2"" thick limbs without bending or denting.The lawnmower has a patent pending on the removable cab, however the lawnmower concept is very basic and non patentable. This means right about the time the big brands copy this lawnmower you will see them for sale in ads for likely 12-20,000.00. I am selling the entire package ready to mow commercial or residential for $7,900.00. The commercial mower by itself is retail priced at $6,000.00, plus tax! So by buying on kickstarter you are buying a mower that does not yet exist for the public, a mower that one day you cannot afford, yet are able to thanks to kickstarter. This is a mower that is name brand, and a frame built at a facility that specializes in medical equipment! Does it get any more U.S.A. made? So your thinking where is the catch? There is not a catch.  The air conditioned cabin will be built on a husqvarna MZT61"" or MZT52"" 27 horsepower lawnmower. M-ZT 61The new M-ZT series zero-turn mower from Husqvarna takes performance, productivity, and comfort to a whole new entry-commercial level. The intuitive operator interface, heavy-duty steel frame and commercial rated hydraulic system create the ultimate mowing experience.

65,"Once you start discovering the beautiful world of robotics, you will realize that are are plenty of excellent electronic options available. You will probably find proper tools, tons of Arduino/Raspberry modules, and several other excellent electronic kits. The problem appears when you actually want to create ""real"" things that interact with those electronics. For the beginner, it's easy to get lost into the thousands of mechanical pieces, servos, motors, aluminium parts and beams available. It's likely that you will spend a lot of money buying some pieces that are not the proper ones, or that cannot be joined together; and eventually spending a lot of time across the several DIY websites to understand what's available and what you could do with those pieces. This kit bridges the gap between DIY electronics and mechanics.

For example, assume you want to create a robotic arm with your specific customization, or you want to create a fan that swings according to some instructions, or a linear rail to place a camera, or a large enclosure for your Arduino projects. Instead of scavenging through internet, it would be easier to get a kit containing all the stuff that your need.Broadly speaking, this Kit includes: A) lots of aluminium extrusions and accessories to connect them for general applications B) other mechanical pieces that can easily be connected to the aforementioned extrusions for more specific applications C) motors and servos that you would typically use in your live projects. For example, this kit allows you to build a robotic arm (for which you can build a support structure using the aluminium extrusions from (A), mount the servo brackets, servo discs, and U-frames from (B), and finally mount the actual servos from (C).In particular the pieces contained on this Kit are:Some of the pieces are standard ones, whereas some of them are specifically designed by us.The parts come in a high-end 68cm x 30cm x 19cm aluminium case for the standard versions. The lower-end ones come in cardboard box with proper packaging foam.We know how frustrating it is for the beginner, to understand how to place the pieces, how to foresee when the acting forces will be just too high, or what's each piece for.We feel that this kit will help a lot of people translate those crazy hardware ideas into real projects. But in order to achieve that, we also want to provide the backers (and eventually whoever buys this) with general ideas, explanations, pictures regarding how to use this kit. For example, we want to explain using a set of pictures (and possibly video), how you would typically assemble  a linear rail system. We will upload this material to our website. Probably this will consist:A) One video per project explaining the final resultB) Another video explaining the mechanical forces acting, and what are the permissible limits of each designC) Additional discussions, links to other websites, and possibly a forum per projectD) Arduino code with explanations1) Is this compatible with Arduino/Raspberry? Absolutely. The servos, stepper motor, and cooler can be easily driven by most micro controllers, with an external 6V(Servos) or 12V battery (Cooler or Stepper Motor). Naturally, the mechanical pieces are hardware-software agnostic.2) Can I build a 3d printer? Many pieces contained here will be useful, but you will need lots of additional pieces. 3) I want to mount these pieces over a tank chassis, can I do it? Yes, aluminium is naturally very light and will be an excellent choice. 4) What are the servo limitations? What are the implications regarding what I can assemble? These are Hi-Torque servos (that stall at around 16kg / cm - that's around 1.5 Newtons per Meter), but their effectiveness decays dramatically as the length of the pieces they work on increases. Typically, you don't want them to work on pieces longer than 20-30cm. 5) Do the pieces come in anodized aluminium? The black pieces come in anodized aluminium6) Do you plan to add more pieces? We might add more pieces if we feel the backers will have difficulties assembling certain types of structures. 7) What are the project ideas you will provide? What are the explanations you will provide? We will add tutorials with tips, videos, pictures, and discussions.  8) Assuming i buy this, what else would i be missing to begin my projects? You will typically be missing an Arduino, cables, batteries and a stepper motor driver.This kit requires pieces from different suppliers and manufacturers. If we don't achieve a minimum amount of backers, the components prices would be just too high (specially for the components designed by ourselves).The amount of backers will also determine the quality of the presentation: the stickers quality, whether we can afford foam slot inserts, the quality of the instructions we provide for assembly, etc.The standard parts will be bulk bought. Most of the non-standard ones will be produced in China by aluminium design factories we have been working with. We might be forced to change some of the pieces, and replace them by alternative ones, should we encounter logistic difficulties.",Francisco Juretig,£274,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Wed, April 20 2016 7:50 PM UTC +00:00","A kit for building home robots, hardware and small technology projects",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,4," Very cool idea!~  Best of luck,Mark~  ",0,"£6,000",PurpleKit by Francisco Juretig — Kickstarter

Currently, these UGS are replacing high-risk human work mostly in the following areas: space, military, and disaster relief. Inadequate terrain navigation is one of the biggest disadvantages of current UGS. Specifically, one capability that is currently lacking in rover systems is the capability to descend vertical or near-vertical terrain.

68,"Our goal in this project is to launch low costs RC competitions that are easily accessible to everyone and much more than just racing. This highly competitive team based competition will be 3V3 and will require strategy with complex objectives such as capture the flag, king of the hill, death match (with paint), sensor feedback etc... To support this we have developed a WiFi Receiver for RC vehicles which provides sensor inputs in addition to motor outputs and allows you to control your vehicle with USB game controllers on the computer with simplicity our highest priority for younger kids as well. To complete more technical tasks than racing, we will also be hosting 3D models of add-ons for RC vehicles that are 3D printable! This will make getting involved much easier and cost effective.We hope to inspire both people in the RC community as well as hobbyist to develop and design their own solutions to compete and accomplish goals.The WiFi Receiver (Radix Board) is a direct receiver replacement for your RC vehicle. Simply connect the receiver, turn on the car and a WiFi hot-spot pops up that says ""RCCAR...""  The software allows you to select a controller (game pad, joystick, steering wheel etc..). Simply link each motor to the available axis on the selected controller and you are up and running! Additionally the Radix board provides 5 motor outputs and 9 analog inputs, effectively making your RC vehicle a robotics platform that can interface with a computer or smart phone! The five motor inputs are along the bottom and the 8 sensor inputs are along the side. The ""JP1"" is for special compatibility and does not need to be moved. The base software will be free for download for Windows. Additionally we have professional grade competition software which will have profiles that can be loaded and saved, Macros that can be recorded to execute precision moves, and conditional motor values that can be linked to 1 of the 8 sensor inputs.Now that your RC vehicle has been upgraded to a Robot, we intend to launch an open source community of 3d models for add-ons to RC vehicles. The birth of 3D printers has made manufacturing small parts accessible to everyone for low cost. What used to be an expensive hobby now allows you to obtain a parts for cents! If you don't have access to a 3D printer, you will be able to purchase the parts from us and we can print them for you! As time goes on this community of parts and add-ons will grow. We also intend to have universal vehicle linking. If you observe in the video, only two parts were printed white. These parts represent the linking parts. For the video we chose a Losi Night Crawler. The two white pieces are the mounting pieces that connect the add-on to the RC car. This way only a few minimal pieces will need to be designed to attach the add-on to your favorite vehicle. The following pictures and links are to provide an idea of the types of add-on's that would be available and how you can access and interact with the 3D models so you can print these yourself! For this, click the ""3D view"" for the ""Robot Arm Rev4.SLDASM"". Then click the ""Explode"" button and you can move the slider around to see exactly how it all fits together!One of the incentives is obtaining a 3D add-on. The add-on includes all of the 3D parts (though if you use a different base vehicle the two mounting brackets won't be compatible) and all of the hardware. The quality of servo's you decide to use is up to you (not included in the add-on package). The video shows the arm being printed on my own 3D printer. Being InvolvedAs part of this project we are creating a highly competitive/cooperative, strategic, team based robotics competition. Now that your favorite vehicle can be upgraded to a robot, and there is an open source community 3D models for add-on parts, each participant can use their own creativity in designing a vehicle for the competition and for low cost! If you notice in our video we used paper clips to secure of arm's linkage. The point is that it works, and we can compete and you can too! For our entire add-on there were two radio shack servo's, some nuts and bolts from the hardware store, some epoxy for gluing of the 3D printed parts. All of this costs about $75 (of course we admit we had access to a 3D printer).Competition ConceptsThe game will be teams of 3V3 and may include elements of capture the flag, king of the hill, racing, driving without seeing your car??...and any other elements which will require a variety of robotic capabilities. As long as each vehicle doesn't intentionally break other vehicles, any add-ons will be allowed. Included as part of the kick starter project will be the first event with pre-built RC vehicles for participants to use. So if you elect for a participation seat you don't have to build your own vehicle (unless you want to then we will check it out the day of).As this competition grows the add-on library and RC vehicles will 
evolve. With the use of 3D printing everyone can become competitive for low cost , and when things break, a new part can cheaply be remade.The incentives include pre-selling attendance seats, and participant seats. We will be having food, and will attempt to get various vendors and hobby stores at the event as well. The first event can be used for people to meet other hobbyist and to form some early stage teams!Finally we will create a league to establish a permanent robotics competitions. Members will have league ID cards. Teams and individual will have standings and ranks; a history of wins and loses. For some this will be a chance to make a name for themselves within our community. If you are good enough to win the league competition you will even recorded in the Hanoratus! Good luck and may fame follow you!For this project we have targeted the bare minimum to launch this. To show our dedication I have not included any salaries or even a shop to set up. We will be doing this out of our house. We feel we want to do everything to give the public the best value, and for me this is simply my passion!

70,"The Airport Personal Transport (APT) is a semi-autonomous, electric,  2-passenger vehicle designed to navigate you through the airport. When you make an airline reservation simply reserve an APT. As you approach the airport, the APT System will notify you where to park. An APT will be waiting for you. Simply roll on your bags. Sit down. Identify yourself via your credit card or mobile device. And then you are whisked off to your terminal safely and at three times your walking speed. APT can also take you from security checks to your gate, from terminal to terminal, and from baggage claim to your car.  APT can become your personal automated chauffeur. 
An APT can go anywhere! For high maneuverability an APT can turn 360 degrees in one place.The proposed APT model will carry two people with bags at speeds up to 12mph and avoid 
obstacles with greater accuracy and dependability than airport electric carts. Autonomous vehicles have been used in factories and hospitals for over a decade.  Latest technological advances make the APT System the safest available. Each APT has multiple obstacle detectors, similar to the ones used in collision avoidance sensors available in automobiles.  Using this monitoring system our software can control the APT’s speed, direction, and final destination.We reached out to MassPort to get real world feedback from a team of airport executives. The Logan Airport staff provided advice, access, and figures to help us think through the feasibility of our APT system. We look forward to continuing this synergy on our Kickstarter project.
With the latest autonomous system controls of APT, costly guideways are now no longer needed.Unsightly guideways represent up to 80% of the capital cost of other advanced systems, such as the Personal Rapid Transit capsule system at Heathrow Airport.The $40,000,000 Heathrow Airport PRT requires guideways and stations that take up valuable real estate and caused constant airport disruption.The estimated cost for a 5,000 foot PRT guideway and twenty 4 passenger cars come to a whopping $25,000,000.30 APTs at Logan Airport is estimated to total under $10,000,000. The APT system can be introduced seamlessly to Logan without any major construction.The goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to build an APT prototype which will prove its basic safety, convenience and plausibility. It will show the APT's ability to sense and react to obstacles many times faster than a human can. This working, full-scale model will demonstrate its capabilities and safety to the public and airline officials, such as those at Logan Airport.

73,"We have been developing a Robotics STEAM education solutions since early 2013 with the goal of increasing the number of STEAM skills in an undergraduate engineering programs and more recently in the K-12 primary and secondary school domains.  We are seeking funding to finish the development of our flagship Robotics STEAM package focused on an open source robot we lovingly call Mazey.Students who may have an interest or passion for STEAM concepts and skills but currently do not receive an opportunity at their school will benefit from our packages.  We want to implement our STEAM packages into schools to allow students to identify their love of science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics earlier so they can decide to pursue engineering or other related STEAM fields at the university level.  And of course our backers benefit!!! They will be able to support our cause and, for some pledges, obtain a Mazey robot and a do-it-yourself education guide to teach themselves, and possibly even get their children interested in STEAM.  Watch the testimonial video below of Natalie, who recently completed a course where the Mazey Robotics STEAM solution was implemented.  Click here for more testimonials! The original intent was for the STEAM package to be implemented in a foundations level course in students first year at the university level to keep engineering majors interested.  Now Mazey is so much more!  Mazey is the conduit to teach STEAM topics and skills to anyone, young and old, novice or expert.  One function of Mazey involves it acting as a ""micromouse"" to autonomously solve a maze.  Below is a video of the lab version of Mazey winning an IEEE Region 2 Student Activities Conference Competition.The evolution of Mazey, technology development, and curriculum was presented at the 2016 American Society of Engineering Education Northeast Annual Conference at the University of Rhode Island.  Click here to view the poster below in more detail.

 
Connecting to a program in Mazey is so simple.  Mazey broadcasts a Wi-Fi network that any device can connect too.  The user simply uses SSH to connect to the network where they are able to navigate Mazey's Linux operating system and execute commands. The user can also use an FTP program to transfer files they compose on their host computer. The Do-It-Yourself education guide is all someone needs to get started.  The actual packaged curriculum we would send to schools can be implemented as a block class, normal 180 day course, or can be modified to fit any type of undergraduate term.Mazey started out as a way for engineering majors to see their true potential and get them excited about engineering.  It is so much more than that!  We have gotten the package in front of high school students and all they want to do is INSTANTLY work with the technology.  They actually WANT to learn!  We are running after-school programs to collect data to provide evidence of what we claim in addition to the evidence collected over the past four years.  Read more about one of our after school programs by clicking here.We need to get packages into schools in the hands of students in our communities!  These Kickstarter development funds will get Mazey into the hands of many people and allow us to finish the development.  We will also be able to increase our inventory and gain exposure.  Your pledges would mean so much to us and would enable MORE students to be exposed to STEAM.Nicholas P.

74,"Wouldn't it be great, if connecting to your drone, was as easy as using an app?

Meet Airstring. Airstring connects your drone to the internet using the mobile phone network.Once your drone is online, you can simply connect to it via your internet connected smartphone or PC, using common apps, like Tower and Mission Planner, allowing you to upload missions, check flight parameters and send commands like Return-To-Home, wherever your drone is. If it has mobile network coverage, it is connected.

Airstring is easy to set up, and comes with a DF13 connector that plugs directly into your Pixhawk telemetry port. Once your drone is switched on, Airstring immediately starts sending telemetry to the server.Airstring is designed to make drone connectivity easy. The air module sends telemetry information to a server, which then forwards this information to the ground stations AirString is composed of the following components, explained below.The Air module reads telemetry data from the pixhawk autopilot and relays them to the Airstring Server. It works with any SIM card.The following picture depicts how to set up Airstring - Air.The Airstring companion app connects to the server via the Internet and to the Air module via bluetooth. It has 2 main features:Although the Air module will attempt to configure itself with the information your SIM carrier provides, having a dedicated Android App makes it easier to make any possible changes to the configuration. Using an App is much more comfortable than running scripts or editing configuration files.Network communications aren't easy. Even less so when you are communicating through the phone Network and need a stable data stream. That is why we are offering our own servers to receive your telemetry and forward it to your smartphone or PC based ground control station. The service will be available for a 6$ monthly subscription fee.However, we are aware that some users might prefer not to rely on 3rd parties when operating their drone. That is why we will release the server code Open Source, allowing you to run your own server at no cost, should you choose to do so.The AirString Server offers the following functionalities:All these extra functionalities are further explained in the following sections.You can use a common Ground Control Station such as Mission Planner, Tower, etc.The Ground Control Stations integrate seamlessly with the Airstring app, allowing you to monitor and control your drone, just like a regular radio.You don't always want to share your flight data, neither do we. Communication from Airstring to the Ground Control Station will be end-to-end encrypted, meaning no one (not even us!) has access to your flight data. If you decide to share your location we will read that before encrypting the traffic.AirString also provides several additional functionalities, explained below.Have all your flight history stored in the server and access it whenever you need. We are in talks to partner with online flight analysis services, to let you analyze these flights right from your browser.
Imagine being on the field and having a problem with your drone that you can't solve on your own. Just get your drone online and let the manufacturers' support team see your telemetry, and make changes right from their office.
You have a fleet of drones, that fly in different locations, or maybe you rent your drones to other operators. Are they operating them safely? With Airstring, you can monitor all your drones from anywhere, without bothering your employees or customers
Keep your location private, or make it available online, it's up to you. In the long run, knowing where every UAV is flying will improve safety and awareness from other airspace users, manned or unmanned.We will even implement a transparent UART feature, letting you connect any UART device (Drones, robots, arduinos, alarms, etc.) and access the data stream via UDP. If you do this, just know that the UDP transmission might change the order of your packets so you will have to re-order them later! Airstring is designed and tested for the Pixhawk autopilot. We even provide the necessary DF13 connector. If you're using this flight controller, compatibility is guaranteed.UPDATE: We received confirmation that Airstring will work with Pixhawk2 and ErleBrain.Updated list of compatible devices.3DR Solo!, 3DR Iris, 3DR X8, 3DR X8-M, 3DR Aero, 3DR Aero-M, Erle Rover, Erle Spider, Erle CopterHowever, other autopilots and drones can also be compatible with the Airstring air module. To use the module you need to access the UART telemetry port on your drone and build a cable that fits the Airstring connector.The input used for telemetry in the Airstring Air module is an UART port. If your drone uses a different port, like the CAN Bus in DJI Drones, it will not be compatible.Airstring is designed for the Mavlink protocol. If the telemetry protocol of your drone is Mavlink, there are good chances that Airstring will work without extra configuration. This might be the case with the APM Flight Controllers or the 3DR Solo, but Airstring is NOT tested on these devices. We only own Pixhawk based drones so we currently cannot test on other platforms.If your drone uses another telemetry protocol, you can try the experimental ""Transparent UART mode"", which transmits the UART port without verifying the data.If you have questions about compatibility for a particular UAV or Flight Controller please contact us for advice. We plan to extend compatibility to other flight controllers in the future.We are two telecommunications engineers with a passion for robotics and UAVs in particular.

We have successfully taken part in ambitious projects like the integration of sensors for self driving cars, or the development of mission control software for a gasoline powered helicopter UAV.For the last 2 years we have been building and operating drones regularly and were never satisfied with the communication systems available.

 We started creating GSM telemetry for our own use, but we can make a much better contribution by offering high quality telemetry systems for drone operators worldwide.

75,"Starting in 2009, I noticed the need for LiDAR. Ground and aerial bots need good data from their physical surroundings to ""prime the pump"" of navigation methodologies like SLAM. Seeing others and myself having to cope with this ""sensory-bottle-neck"" was frustrating. We'd have this great microprocessor system, advanced program code, and really capable bot, but without LiDAR and SLAM, we couldn't trust the machine to fly around autonomously. So, wanting to participate in the 2011 International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC), I started looking at sensory solutions. Some of the teams could afford the Hokuyo LiDARs. These were 1200 to 6500 US$,  and the modern ones are USB only. Other teams used home made solutions like scanned ultrasound, crossed laser beams and so on. But until I saw the Neato XV-11 hack challenge, I wasn't sure where to go next. Fortunately, seeing autonomous flight attempts from 2011 to 2013 in Grand Forks North Dakota, I became more and more convinced that sensory and telemetry systems are the key to getting our UAV's to be more than just expensive toys.At CSU Chico, my Electronic Engineering and Computer Science peers and I followed the XV-11 LiDAR and Microsoft Kinect reverse engineering bounty. Including some reverse engineering and operating of the structured light optical train ourselves (really cool by the way!). But seeing the CMU cam 4 and the XV-11 LiDAR really brought my mind to focus. A spinning LiDAR is unavoidable for the hobbyist, high school through college students, and experts alike. The lack of -  and need for - an affordable open source LiDAR has become an intolerable obstacle, and this must change. I want this device to follow the spirit of the CMU cams and Pixy 5 optical flow cameras. This LiDAR should be easy to attach to Arduino's, PICs, STM32s and Basic Stamps. The interface and coding should be simple, and will be thoroughly documented in a PDF. Example code and sample setups will be included. This LiDAR is meant for High School teachers and students all the way up to college professors and students. My goal is for more LiDARs in the market place, at lower cost.Pixy (CMUcam 5) : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/254449872/pixy-cmucam5-a-fast-easy-to-use-vision-sensorLike the XV-11, it will have a mechanically scanned sensor. This method has been used in industry for decades for radar and other sensors. The sensor is from the PulsedLight3D LLC group and this device, the ""LidarLite"" version, is already proven and certified for human eye safety. The turret housing the LED and detector will spin 3 times per second, and the data will be returned serially through a slip ring commutator. The motor will be held at a constant RPM with a closed loop speed regulator. each of the 100 pulses per second distance measurements, will be indexed to the degrees of a compass, as in other common devices. Ive put in more than 2,000 hours and 4,000 dollars of my own time and money researching, building and learning. I wouldn't be asking others to do the same if I didn't believe in the critical importance of this technology. So, I currently have the rotating test device, which has verified the geometry and signal timings. next up, there will be code written for a STM32L1 discovery board to interface with an actual lidar lite.
Seen in this clip, the rotating turret and oscilloscope. Ill have the STM32L1 attached soon, to read the IR break beam encoder.For this project, its important for potential backers to know that I have all the necessary instruments, and knowledge to use them. Oscilloscopes, Logic analyzers, Volt meters, Logic programming, soldering, CNC milling, Circuit board etching tank and so on. So this isn't my first rodeo :) And feel free to look at my previous work in UAV's and High Voltage projects. Further, Im using our purchasing power in quantity to press the price down.

Sie ist dann mit Drahtseilen (durch ein Schlauch) mit der Steuerbox verbunden.Diese Roboterhand ist extrem einfach aufgebaut, so das das Erlernen des Hardware Aufbaus sehr einfach ist. Somit ist auch gegeben, das Schüler diese selbst reparieren können und somit wiederum Kosten sparen.Mit dieser sehr kostengünstigen Roboterhand können dann Schüler an Hochschulen, Universitäten und Firmen das programmieren von Künstlicher Intelligenz an lebensechter Hardware erlernen. Die meisten , selbst einfachsten Roboter kosten zu viel.Deep Learning muss auf realer Hardware getestet werden, nicht nur in der Simulation. Mach dies für Alle MöglichHereby you support the construction of a ready-to-production prototype. This robot hand is modeled on humans. The diameter of a finger is 8 mm, which allows the Hand to be ideally integrated into a silicone mold of a human hand.In the pictures one can see that the electronics was installed fairly simple. With a PVC control box each electronic device should get its proper place.Hiermit unterstützt du die Herstellung eines produktionsreifen Prototypen. Diese

Many public and private spaces aren’t suitable for free and easily movement of these people. Only few places have installed a special purpose lifts or access ramps. Moreover, even these usually are unpresentable, cumbersome, requiring special skills of the specialists for installations and also they are expensive.  

We want to create a stair lift, which would be affordable for everyone by its price and also won’t demand much effort in installation works. It is universally installed stair-lift of serial production, which you can easily install both indoors and outdoors according to the chosen model. 

We believe that a special purpose device can be compact, aesthetical, elegantly adapted to interior / exterior, working without noise. But we need your help for the improvement of this stair-lift and in order to make it affordable to everyone. Only together we can transform this idea to reality.

81,"Thankyou for taking a look at my project, My name is Rickey and I'm a electronics enthusiast who enjoys building machines that can think for themselves, without the aid of any programming. I would like to share with you 3 projects I am currently developing. If successful this will help me continue what I love doing and be able to share it with you!PCB - WalkmanOut of the 3 boards offered here this has to be the most advanced, giving a robot the ability to think for itself. it uses inverters as artificial neurons built into the driver chips (included). This robot will be able to automatically teach itself to walk after powering up the board. This is called adaptive robotics in-which the circuit will compensate to changes in it's environment. Making modifications to its walking style, if the robot obtains any damage to the legs, the robot will reteach itself how to move.The board is based on designs from roboticist Mark Tilden. As you can see the board is wider than the one used in the picture above.  This is to make assembling the board as easy as possible. Using cheap through hole components and solder tabs for including your own types of switches,sensors and motors. Making a truly customisable robot. examples below: Features:4 motor + Waist motor,crab-walking, reversing, reversing and turning (photo-taxis), hind leg lifting (Out of hole function) and photo-tropic behaviour (light seeking) Other sensors can also be easily incorporated. Adding connectors to the board means that this board can easily be swapped out and placed inside different robot chassis's.Kit includes; PCB Board + IC sockets & Driver chips + Instructions. (other components are not included)PCB - Moon walkerCheck back in a few minutes!Features,Moon-Walker is a 2-motor walker with light seeking abilities, left,right and reverse functions, The is also 2 red and 2 green LED's incorporated into the circuit to show the various neural processes.Kit includes; PCB Board + IC sockets & Driver chips + Instructions. (other components are not included) PCB - Head walkerFeatures:
HeadWalker is conceptually based on Justin Johnson's ""PhotoWalker"", It refers to a modular type of walker that responds to signal from both a head and other types of sensors. The main modules are:
A reversing master bicore - slave monocore to control the walking motors.
A Power Smart Head 1 complete with integrators to seek (or avoid) light.
A selection of higher level control circuits which include touch sensors and regulate the walker's response to light. Kit includes; PCB Board + IC sockets & Driver chips + Instructions. (other components are not included)Items crossed out in red are included in the kit, the other components have to be self sourced. These components are basic and very cheap so sourcing shouldn't be a issue. (Please note component count/values may be changed while the design and manufacturing process is taking place) Most motors can be used,but servo motors are probably the best (with the electronics taken out the top of the servo)",RICKWARE,£399,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sat, May 16 2015 8:49 PM UTC +00:00","A excellent platform for anyone to get into robotics, just simply solder in the required parts & see you creations come to life!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,14," Which schematic are you using for the Walkman PCB?

82,"Introduction: As you can see from the video, the prototype device uses a PID implementation that allows the arm that is connected to the motor to adjust itself via the Infrared Sensor and the micro-controller processor to follow my hand. (Still image below)What is PID:Proportional-Integral-Derivative is a a closed loop feedback controller that allows a system to minimize the error by adjusting the process through the use of a manipulated variable. Block Diagram for PID:Setpoint: Is a value that I set as a reference/distance between IR sensor and my hand. (This controls the arm of the DC motor to either turn clockwise or counter- clockwise) Error: Is the error generated from the IR sensor in trying to establish the value set from the setpoint.Process: Is the actual value readings from the IR sensor.Actual: Using a summation from a previous process, the Setpoint and the actual are subtracted to try to minimize the error between them.Quick Explanation using my video:If my hand gets too close to the IR sensor, the value I assigned as the  distance would be below it. So the IR sensor would try to correct itself by communicating with the DC motor to rotate away from my hand to try to reach the value that I had set. The same process is done if I pull away far from the IR sensor. Basically, the values gained from the IR sensor have errors and the PID tries to reach no errors (stability) as fast as possible. This gives the motion of the motor, a smooth motion as it tries to reach that setpoint. If PID was not used, the motor would skip and the smoothness would not be there. What is my goal:As a Engineering Graduate Student there are a lot of concepts to understand and never really any hands on learning as the classes get more rigorous. Having built and implemented a PID to a physical device has taught me to grasp the concepts even further and I wish to pass on this knowledge to undergraduate students at CSULA.My goal is to teach undergraduate students how to implement Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) by hands on learning experience through my workshop. This would require the necessary components to build a set of 5 devices to show undergraduate students;1. How to properly connect the device  - using a micro-controller  - DC Motor  - Infrared Sensor2. How to implement the algorithm (coding) to the device  - the algorithm using C++ and an IDE to impliment on processor 3. Visually see and understand how PID affects the device  - Upon completion of the device  -  Implement the algorithm and explain how PID improves the system Why I need you?This is basically the only means of supporting this project to make this workshop into a reality.

84,"PawBot is world's only wet food feeder which can automatically open and serve multiple food cans (18 cans capacity) to cats and dogs without human intervention. Our patented method is unique from any other pet food dispenser on the market. You don't need to manually open cans and there are no ice packs to freeze. PawBot is fully automated and thoroughly tested.Simply load up fresh cans and bowls, tell PawBot how many cans a day should be opened and dispensed and you are done. Optionally, you can setup feeding times. Any old stale food will be put into trash by PawBot before a new pet food can is opened and dispensed. You might be wondering for such a sophisticated robot, why are we looking to raise such a low amount? The answer is easy. We the creators of PawBot have already pooled in our personal money to get all the research, setup and tooling of all parts completed. Parts include electronics, plastic parts and metal fabricated parts.The current challenge is our parts manufacturers need us to meet a minimum order quantity to start the parts manufacturing process. Your pledge will help us establish market demand for PawBot and we will be using your pledge to make the initial deposit to our parts manufacturers and make that commitment to start this production process.   As you know KickStarter funding is ""all or nothing"", which means if we don't meet our goal, you will not be charged for the amount of your pledge.PawBot team also guarantees delivery of PawBot unit to you. We guarantee that if for any reason we decide to not go through with this project, we will refund you your deposit amount we receive from KickStarter. Your pledge will give us the market demand commitment and deposit money we need to kick off our production process. We will ask you for the remainder of the money prior to shipping your PawBot unit to you. This will help us with the needed cash flow and fastest production cycle for PawBot.We are really excited to bring this functional, helpful robot to your home.

Now, anyone, even those without programming knowledge, can design, 3D print, and control their own robot.First, download our intuitive, open-source software, BowlerStudio. BowlerStudio is available at Launch in an Alpha release! BowlerStudio and all software for the Bowler Operating system is Free Software, and will be distributed free of cost forever. For the first-time robot builder, start with a easily customizable, ready-to-run script. Load some of the sample robot templates and watch them walk as a virtual model. Modify them with an easy to use function of the software.  Then, if you have a 3D printer, click print, and watch the parts of your new robot appear.Once the parts are printed, install the WiFi DyIO, and BowlerStudio will connect the hardware to a virtual robot model you designed. With the WiFi capabilities of the latest DyIO generation, your robot will now be ready to be controlled from a computer or Android phone from across the room, or around the globe. It’s that easy. The WiFi DyIO can be used with BowlerStudio, a powerful robotics development and app-running framework. BowlerStudio lets you write code and events in:The WiFi DyIO also works with any device you would normally connect to a microcontroller, and links that device to your PC through BowlerStudio. These devices are accessed at 3ms update rate over USB. Simple enough to teach 5th grade students, and powerful enough to be used by research doctors. The WiFi DyIO was designed after years of working with university researchers and school teachers. The first generation USB-only DyIO can be purchased at all Micro Center stores, and now, we want to create a wireless version. That's where you come in. With your help, we'll be able to manufacture the WiFi-enabled version and bring it into classrooms, homes, and for medical research. So far, we’ve successfully tested prototypes of the second generation. Once we reach our Kickstarter goal, we will be able to put the final touches, complete quality testing, and start manufacturing WiFi DyIO within a four months. Neuron Robotics Cooperative is a community-based, open-source robotics research organization located in Worcester, Massachusetts. We are worker-owned and worker-managed, and operate out of our local makerspace, Technocopia.We regularly teach classes in the Central Massachusetts community for 5th graders through college students and professionals. Your support allows us to complete testing and development, add more community outreach campaigns, and bring robotics to a wider audience. Plus, spreading the word on how easy and accessible robots can be with the WiFi DyIO makes each one cheaper to produce, and more affordable to own for everyone! Even a $1 pledge let’s others on Kickstarter know that people believe in the WiFi DyIO and making customizable, powerful robots something anybody can learn and use.The DyIO has two banks (Fused, 6.5a each) with 12 ports each. All ports can be servo or digital I/O. Select ports can be used to drive a H bridge and stepper motor drivers and read analog voltages, encoders, PPM signals and SPI/UART devices.The channels each consist of 3 pins. GND, power, and signal. The voltage is selected between external battery (motors) and 5V USB (sensors) using a jumper. The current DyIO can be connected to via a 5v serial port or USB. The WIFi version will also allow for wireless connections.The DyIO Also has 8 on-device PID controllers that can take any input as an error signal and control any output. These PID controllers run without intervention from the PC and asynchronously update the PC on their state as they run.Internally, the DyIO uses a PIC32mx440f128h for USB Comms, and advanced features like encoder counting, servo motion profiles, stepper motor control and PPM control. IO is handled by a companion ATMEGA644P that connects to the PIC and runs at 5V. Both cores can be re-programmed using a USB bootloader that runs on the PIC.Communications between the DyIO and the PC use Bowler Packets and the Bowler protocol. The Bowler protocol is stateless and RPC based. RPCs come in groups called Namespaces. The Bowler protocol is fully introspective and allows the PC to interrogate the device and build a list of Namespaces and RPCs. The protocol is documented on our wiki.

They learn to build mechanical, electrical, pneumatic systems, as well as computer aided design (CAD) and modeling software. They
learn programming in LabView, C++ or Java. It’s
as close to real world science and engineering as you can get. Most of our students come from disadvantaged schools where attaining college can be but a dream. However, through the guidance and support of mentors and IMF staff The Impossible Mission Force Robotics team becomes engaged in an innovative program that motivates them to pursue career opportunities science and technology.  By working as a valued member in a culturally diverse team, they are able to build their self-confidence and hone their leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills all while becoming eligible to compete for some $20 million in college

89,"Hello World, this is ALAN. ALAN, meet the rest of the world! Interacting with robots face-to-face will be common in the future.Designing, personalizing, and modifying ALAN is just the beginning. We hope that interaction with ALAN will further shape the types of projects and programming builders have access to. We encourage users to explore. Share your Mods, color schemes, programming and sensor additions with our network of builders around the world.   Free up your hands and have ALAN hear and speak with you using speech synthesis and speech recognition. Build a personality by creating or editing a Chatbot.  Create databases and train ALAN to recognize friends and family, even greeting them when they enter the room. We set out to design a new robot builder experience that allows users to explore humanoid robotics in both form and function. ALAN provides opportunities for creativity, inspiration, and modifications that aren't easily found in the current marketplace. Our kits are designed to support flexibility and creativity. Whether you are a beginning builder, or advanced programmer we have a kit that is right for you. Whatever rewards you choose, ALAN will help you Get Ahead In Robotics™. Using the powerful EZ Robots' EZB™ as the micro-processor and the EZ Builder interface, face-to-face interactions with ALAN are easily accomplished. No programming knowledge is needed to get started, simply use the click and drop controls. EZ Builder supports these advanced functions:RoboRealm™ or EZ-AI™ (not included) can extend Alan's functions and include: counting objects, shape matching, pupil detection, path planning and so much more.With ALAN, you can take your building and programming skills to the next level. Whether you use our electronics package or source your own,  once assembled, your ALAN will support innovation through:To support ALAN innovators that are just beginning to explore humanoid bots, we suggest our Silver Innovator Kit with the EZB™ micro-controller and camera.  This is the micro-controller used at Robomodix with our ALAN. EZB™  utilizes Windows environment to run its software.Building not your thing? Want to start interacting with ALAN right away? This is the reward for you. Platinum kit includes a fully assembled, programmed, and painted ALAN with a Tablet PC. It comes with the customized LED light array seen on our prototype. Backers at this level will also be able to choose a voice and color scheme (3 options) for ALAN. After considering numerous factors from material costs to tooling we determined that $125,000 goal would allow us to bring Robomodix to the marketplace. We have broken down general cost categories above. Pre-Production and the handmade production of the physical parts comprise 80% of our estimated budget for this funding goal. We have worked hard to negotiate cost effective suppliers to minimize production costs as well as secure a manufacturing team. To ensure we can deliver ALAN to our backers, we have also included a risk mitigation factor to account for unforeseen costs. ",Robomodix,"$31,253","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sun, December 13 2015 6:03 PM UTC +00:00",The first modular robot kit designed to explore android and human interactions.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,45," @Creators, I apoligize that I responded to the attack on myself in such a way, And I am sorry that your project did not meet goal. but I stand by my original post and hope that the information in it may be useful in a redesign of your product and reintroducing at a lower pricepoint. Good luck to you.~  Dear pompous arrogant ass, I was going to type out a response to you and decided that you and your unintelligent opinion really wasn't worth my time for a well thought out and explained reply, in which I will save except to tell you that when you are ready to educate yourself further, to Google ""Uncanny Valley"" (for starters as this is one of perhaps more than a hundred studies on the problem that this campaign product faces)~  I backed both projects with the full knowledge that both are really nothing more than objects.. One is a toy with toy features, the other is a toy made to look more sophisticated with a pricetag to attract elitist asshole Sharper Image and Fao Schwartz consumers such as yourself. Mine was purchases for my child to get her interested in a growing future field. with thoughts for the future of using the ""Pipecleaner"" components as a base for rebuilding. while I considered if I really thought that Alan was worth it's pricepoint and if there was any value in it for her that Ohbot did not offer. It would appear that on pricepoint, the fellow backers proved that Alan was not a viable project to invest their money into. At least she will have one to interact with while you are staring at the blank space on your desk where you thought your Alan would be sitting.~  I also would like to note, that my question of what does Alan do that Ohbot cannot was never answered. therefore I am left to assume that for all the hype, extra plastic and fancy skins. I was correct in assuming that this project lacked anything notable that would encourage me to increase my pledge to include Alan as an alternate or replacement for the Dobot as a learning gift for her.~  Enjoy the empty spot on your desk while you talk to yourself.~  Otaku, if Alan, ""wasn't so damn expensive"", he would look like a child's toy, like the OhBot.If you have really been following this project you would know that Robomodix has many things in store for Alan such as different faces. For instance a female face.  Your not scared of females, are you?  Also, Alan will be made of much better materials than colored plastic and what looks like pipe cleaners for lips and tin for a nose.  If you wan't something that looks like a toy and doesn't make you ""uncomfortable"" by all means pay the $149 for the OhBot, or put on your big boy pants and INVEST in ALAN, a more elegant Robot, that will still be teaching and interacting with your grandchildren, while the other robots with their plastic flat planed features and exposed wires have been laid to rest in the back of a closet, because they look like a child's toy.  I think ALAN is what you truly want, even though he will give you ""nightmares"", or you wouldn't have been following this ""great project with interest.""So, do what I did, and scrape the money together, because when ALAN is ready, and if you are truly interested in Robotics, you won't want to be left wondering why you didn't save that $149. and come up with $350. more, so that you could have the Robot that is going to be the ""next revolution in robotics.""~  @Barbara Howlett-Perez, it's subjective if the robot should be too perfect or too smart like Apple Siri or Echo vs some robots or AI can be quite natural in communicative. Each have their own targeted market and remember uptime and warranty is a must.~  I hope the creator could develop a full-sized robot that can help out with house chores, play with the dog and take care of elderly.~  If only it wasn't so damn expensive.. for something that is just going to scare me every time I walk into the room, or give me the nightmares I used to get from the ""Clown"" pictures I had hanging in my room as a child... I'm sure more people would back it!  The Silicone face, and even without the face, it's just too... unnerving... for lack of a better word, for me to want to interact with it. Although I think it is a great project that I have been following with interest. I can't help but keep wondering what Alan can do at $699 that the Ohbot can't do at $149 and less ""uncomfortable"" factor?~  How do I convince people that ALAN can do much more than Siri or Echo by Amazon?   Any quick examples?~  I love this project but it is not looking good at this stage... I am going to share it with other who might want to support it and urge others to do likewise...

90,"Although we still are a small company, we are very proud and grateful to present you some facts which witness the happiness and satisfaction of those who have already experienced Keelcrab.Help us to continue in the right way! First installation  of Keelcrab Sail Pack on Cobra 41 Sail Boat.Mr. Bernt Fernström of the company http://dalarobatvard.se/ first importer who believed in us and our project, has obtained a 50% subsidy for the purchase of keelcrab in Sweden from Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management since Keelcrab has been recognized as Eco-friendly investment in water quality improvement. Not only that Gothenburg University invited him on their research vessel ”Hrimfare” for using and evaluating the KeelCrab drone. They are already ten the harbours which have become Keelcrab point and have chosen Keelcrab drones for the hulls maintenance. Soon it will be the remedy most used on our shores.  Capt. Diego Comuni, currently embarked on ""Xasteria"" (Perini Yacht) has chosen Keelcrab for the care and maintenance of the hull.  Even Costa Crociere Ltd. chose Keelcrab for the cleaning of the waterline.       From the passion for sea and boats KeelCrab project took life!! Keelcrab is an underwater drone able to carry out cleaning and hull
inspection activities. Designed mainly for cleaning the hull
of sailing boats (of any size), yachts and maxi yachts, with
a particularly pleasing result at the waterline and on the
planing parts. MAIN FUNCTION: OPTIMIZING HULL MAINTENANCE THROUGH THE REMOVAL OF THE BIO-FOULING ALGAE AND VEGETATION THAT CONSTANTLY APPEAR ON ITS SURFACE.                                            DO IT YOUR SELF !! 
                                            WHERE YOU WANT                                            WHEN YOU WANT 
                                    WITHOUT MOVING THE BOAT !       KEELCRAB is characterized by an exoskeleton in plastic
material with neutral hydrostatic balance. TECHNICAL INFOThe vacuum /
aspiration force is generated by a central impeller or turbine
(propeller), driven by an brushless motor, which performs the
dual function of keeping the robot attached to the hull and
removing algae formed thereunder. The movement is driven
by rubber brushes on tracks that allow movements in all
directions. VERY SIMPLE ! Keelcrab can be used by everyone . . . .  by you, your son or by the person who takes care of the maintenance of your boat. It has been developed to be a user-friendly drone and as such it can be commanded by anyone on his own in order to perform the hull cleaning . This is made possible thanks to a remote control device with
display and to a IP68 video camera with LED lights installed on the drone. By looking at the screen you are able to maneuver your
Keelcrab through simple directional buttons on the remote control as well as to monitor and check the conditions of your hull on the same time. Yes, sure it is. Keelcrab drone is a solution that respects the waters and the marine environment. Why?First of all, in order to perform efficiently its function Keelcrab is equipped with certified brushes ( soft-medium-hard ) with nylon bristles. Their certification (A.N.C.C.P. ), obtained after several tests performed in a simulated environment , establishes that such brushes are not able to remove neither toxic fixed anti-fouling paints streched on the hulls nor the biocidal substances present in them but  just the overlying vegetation. When the vegetation begins to grow it means that the anti-foluing is losing its biocidal effect and in fact, numerous tests have demonstrated that the constant removal of the first layer of algae (3 mm) dramatically prolongs the efficiency of the anti-fouling agent making it possible to reduce the quantity used over time. As a result of that barnacles cannot form in the medium term as they don't find vegetation and then a cleaner hull allows the boat to perform better reducing on the same time the fuel consumption.Now, think to lay the anti-fouling only on some technical parts of the hull leaving the rest of the hull to keelcrab drone, so that you can benefit in terms of less costs of maintenance and less pollution .In this regard, take a look to the videos and to the tables below.  A clean difference can be seen between the used amounts of anti-fouling and the related costs that need to be beared depending on whether you are using keelcrab or not .1) Less Pollution 2) Savings 3) Comfort because of the possibility to clean your boat whenever you      want according to your need4) Top performance of your boatWHY KEELCRAB BAG CAN BE USED? Even though the residual material is just natural compound, it seemed necessary to us to design a system which would allow the users to easily collect and dispose the vegation removed by keelcrab. In this way, as a matter of good manners and civility we aim to keep port waters as clean and clear as possible by recovering all the waste or at least most of it. 
THERE IS ALSO A VERY IMPORTANT TECHNICAL REASON....Usually, once a cleaning operation has been performed, it should be better to make the boat moving and navigating in order to avoid that removed algae stick again to the hull. So, thank to this nylon filter and to its ability to keep and to retain the waste collected, it will no longer needed to move the boat.IS IT POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE KEELCRAB WITH NEW GREEN PRODUCTS ? Yes, indeed by solving the problem acting on the effect and not on the cause, Keelcrab can be perfectly integrated with green solutions (ultrasound or biocides free paints) you are already using for your boat. Numerous tests have demonstrated that its calibrated cleaning ability, by simulating the navigation motion and  self-cleaning effect, can fit efficiently with green paints giving as a result a perfect and 100% ecological combination for the  maintenance of the hulls.THINKING ALWAYS GREENER .  .  .  .  .  . . We would like to conclude this section giving you some food for thought as:what would happen to our seas if all the boats used even less than 80% of the anti- fouling they normally use yearly , without changing the coonsumption rate as well as the the performance?and as a consequent of that how would the marine environment change ? Could it improve the quality of our fish ?In any of the rewards levels of Keelcrab Sail One, the basic package will include:        - 3 transportation cases:

Few but with great energy, creativity and passion.Aeffe s.r.l. derives from a strong enterprising spirit and a passion for automated mechanical solutions; the beating heart of the company is a team of young people able to boast a variety of excellent skills ranging from electronics to mechanical design, as well as information technology and diving. After honing its technical and marketing skills with the Keelcrab series of underwater drones (European patent filed in Italy on 18 May 2009), today the company designs and manufactures also custom-built underwater vehicles .
Although Keelcrab core business is the production of underwater drones for hull maintenance, the team can boast a high specialization in modern construction techniques, a strong engagement in on-going research and development, a flexible approach to customisation according to the customer’s needs and at last an efficient service and post-sales customer care.  F.A.Q.Technical questions about the product -	What’s the voltage ? 220v or 110v ( american standard) , converted in low voltage 48v -	What’s its power consumption? Maximum is 250 watt/hour and average consumption is 200 Watt/hour -	What’s the standard length of the drone power cable? Its length is 20 meters
-	Is the power cable reinforced ? Yes, it is reinforced with Kevlar (120Kg traction) -	Can I use the drone cable to transport or manovreur Keelcrab? Not exactly. It is possible to move Keelcrab and pull it carefully by the cable only when the drone is in the water. Instead, either you have to take it out the water or you have to immerse it, we strongly advice to use the handle ( standard dotation). -	What’s the standard lenght of remote control cable? The remote control cable lenght is 5 Meters. -	What’s the Led power? The Led power is 200 Lumen -	How to collect the vegetation removed by keelcrab?  In the claw pack we provide the keelcrab bag kit that is able to recover part of the vegetation removed through a nylon filter bag( meglio non parlare di micrometria). In this way, you can avoid that part of the vegetation removed is able to stick again on the hull’s surface.
-	How deep could it be used ? The maximux depth is 10 meters.
Keelcrab cleaning ability -	What is keelcrab drone able to remove? Keelcrab cleaning function is set to make the drone able to remove algae and vegetation; numerous tests have proven its effectiveness even on boats moored in port waters since 6-12 months; -	Does keelcrab remove mussels or barnacles ? If not why ? It doesn’t for valid reasons.
First of all, in case such organisms grow up on hull’s surface, it could mean two things: either the anti- fouling paint used  is not suitable for the waters where the boat is moored or it’s been too long since the last time the anti-fouling has been drafted on the hull’s surface.
Secondly, our experience  has taught us that their removal on the water could be very dangerous for the safety of the hull and for its life cycle. Such organisms normally stick so hardly on the hull that their forcible removal through a large abrasion, is be able to provoke for sure the detachment of the paintings and in the worst cases this opreation could compromise the physical integrity of gel coat causing as a result problems of moisture infiltration and osmosis.
In such cases there’s no other solution but to take the boat out of the water and to let the dockyard make the standard  cleaning cycle usually performer by  raising the boat with crane. THEREFORE, BY REMOVING  THE VEGETATION LAYER  KEELCRAB PREVENTS THEIR RISE SINCE THEY DO   NOT FIND FERTILE GROUND  FOR THEIR PROLIFERATION-	Can I potentially clean all the hull’s surface using keelcrab? In terms of percentage, keelcrab is able to clean 80/90% of the hull of a sail boat and motor boat with planing hull by 40 feet and up leaving to the shipowner  or professionals the shafts, propellers, rudders and corners-	How many times do I need to use Keelcrab ? It depends from several factors such as the temperature and the type of water,  presence of fresh water tributaries and seasonality. However, our experience allows us to say that if water temperature exceeds 22/23 degrees it is advisable to use it even once a month;
Keelcrab Accessories Questions-	Is it possible to order an extension of the cable ? Yes of course, it possible to customize the length of both the drone cable either the remote control cable: 
1. Cable pack: 10 meters of additional cable on the remote control and 10 meters of additional cable on the drone = 130 euros; send an email to info@keelcrab.com after purchase. 2. Customization of cable length; € 5 / meter remote control cable & Euro 12 / meter drone  cable; send an email to info@keelcrab.com after purchase. -	Can I replace the brush on my self? The brushes are easy and fast to replace ( Allen key 4) . 
We have 3 different models of which one ( medium brush ) is part of the standard dotation instead the other two (Soft and Hard) are part of the adventure pack. Soft = very thin vegetation/ possibly on ablative anti-fouling paints (even though Keelcrab use is not recommended with this type of paints) Medium = standard brush very effective on different conditions of medium dirt / ideal for routine maintenance Hard = for hard dirt tending to coral (incrostazione) SHIPMENT QUESTIONS --- Measures of reward ""keelcrab sail one drone"" 36x45x77 18 kg --- Measures of reward ""keelcrab sail one professional pack"": 75X80X50 25 kg --- Measures of reward  ""dubble pack"": 72x90x18 36 kg --- Hs code: 84795000 SPARE PARTS:  request spare parts price list to info@keelcrab.comTECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT ANTI-FOULING-	Further considerations on anti-fouling
Keelcrab  is perfectly compatible with fixed anti- foulings. Nylon bristles aren’t strong enough neither to remove the anti-fouling layer nor to be compared with sanding machines or high pressure washers.
Any type of  fixed silicon base paint.
Instead, it mustn’t be used with ablative anti-fouling paints right because they need that boat is motion in order to perform their cleaning function on the surface. So, they are different from the others since they keep the hull clean by detaching gradually from the surface due to the navigation. In this case,  the use of keelcrab is strongly discourage.Technical Course -	In a specific area of our website they will be available for all our customers (free subscription) tutorial videos about  basic assistance ( send a mail to info@keelcrab.com with drone serial number in order to receive the access password) -	Only for the Keelcrab points, we will provide a dedicated area with tutorial videos regarding extraordinary assistance.Warranty, lifetime  components  subject to wear and drone maintenance -	500 hours or 2 year warranty on engine block, camera, led lights, electronics box and remote control excluding nylon brushes and rubber that depend on use but generally do more than 50/100 hours;
-	Maintenance= thorough rinsing in fresh water after every use; once completed the cleaning operation take care to use connector plugs and make sure  to put away(store) electronics box and remote control in dry environment. supported by http://kickingitforward.org

 The circle of customers: people who want to adjust their weight every day and monitor their health and proper nutrition
 
 This program is built on the basis of neural networks
.Functions:
 1. Analysis of the data on the need to correct the weight indices in an individual order, taking into account: height, weight, blood group, age, physiological data and pulse measurement, etc.
 2. Counts the number of calories during the day that a person receives during the day.
 3. Counts the number of calories during the day, which are expended for walking, sleeping, running, etc;
 4. Gives recommendations for each day on the number of calories needed and the cost for individual calculations;
 5. The program independently determines how much weight needs to be adjusted during the day, week, month, etc., taking into account the individual characteristics of the organism.
 6. Gives recommendations on correct and balanced nutrition, gives recommendations on the compatibility of products individually, taking into account physiological factors and blood group, as well as taking into account the time of day.An example of an application.
On the basis of individual indicators, the program calculates the need for weight correction or maintenance of these weights. The calculation is for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month. The program analyzes for each day how many people have received and spent calories. And also whether it is possible, for example, to eat a hamburger in a particular case and a specific time of day. The analysis is conducted on-line. For example, a person can eat a hamburger only in the morning, someone can not at all today, and someone can be at 6 o'clock in the evening. Each person can ask the program the question: ""Can I eat it now?"" The program will answer ""yes"", ""no"", in what quantity and will give recommendations.",Yuliya Manin,$31,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sun, December 10 2017 6:42 PM UTC +00:00",Weight correction program online,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,3, удачи!~  ,0,"$15,000","Robot nutritionist ""Misha"" by Yuliya Manin — Kickstarter"
92,"THE STORY:  A physically disabled friend of mine has a large yard that even a person in perfect physical health couldn't cut with a push mower and even the best zero turn mowers he has tried leave him in pain for days due to the rough ride.  So I began tinkering with scrap parts I either had around the house or picked up from Craigslist cheap to see if I was able to build a remote operated lawnmower that could handle larger yards, not fall apart when running over roots or limbs, and provide a cut as good as any other lawn mower I had seen.  THE CONCEPT BUILD: The concept build consisting of mainly components that would have been typically thrown away is what you see in the video and isn't indicative of the appearance on the final design. This build allowed me to test many basic functions and to have a clear picture of what the final design should be. Even with this cheap build (The frame and front casters are part of a $40 clothing rack) it was able to walk through every reasonable and some unreasonable obstacles I put in its path and come out with an excellent cut.SAFETY: All Mow-BillyT Bots will be designed and built with a safety first mentality. My goal here to provide a product that is helpful and fun. Precautions like automatic cut offs will be in place to prevent any of these bots from running out of control. Mass Appeal:  One of the most amazing things to me personally was the wide appeal it has with people. I brought this to a family reunion and watched as the control was passed from the hands of elderly men, to middle aged women, and on down to young kids and then back up the chain. This was when I realized not only did have have something that could be extremely beneficial to many, but it was simply fun for everyone.  OFFICIAL VERSION: There was a wealth of knowledge gained not only through my experimenting with changes to the concept build, but from allowing friends, family, and complete strangers of all ages and backgrounds to use this bot and provide any and all input they could think of. Taking all this into account the final build will offer everything the one in the video offers + a few additional things such as automatic height adjustment from the remote, a mountable area to add on a wireless camera for streaming, better front casters, heavier duty components, plus much more. These will be built to order and will allow for some customization to accommodate different yards, budgets, and personal touches such as color scheme.  FUNDING:  If you decide this is a project worth sharing with the world and this campaign turns out to be successful I will do the following:1) Build The Official Mow-BillyT Bot for demonstrations and for people to have a basis to work off of for their own customization. I will include videos on the site showing functions and basic troubleshooting. 2) Get the website built to allow online customization and purchases.3) Continually work on features to improve the lives of those who are not physically capable of doing typical day to day tasks. 4) Keep it fun.

I’ve seen many Children smile through demonstrations.  This project has launched to overcome the language barrier and deliver smiles to people living outside of Japan.  We would do demonstrations in Hollywood with the help from Chikako Suzuki, the producer of the Japan Film Festival Los Angeles. I want to use this opportunity and expand possibilities in overseas with Ms. Keromi.  I would send you merchandise of Ms. Keromi as the reward.  It’s been five years since I created Ms. Keromi, and many people fell in love with her through these years.  I always wanted to give merchandise of Ms. Keromi to her fans. This is the chance I was waiting for. There are two purposes of this project.  The first, to overcome the language barrier and have people in Los Angeles jump rope with Ms. Keromi.  The second, to deliver merchandise of Ms. Keromi to her fans. 
Please support this project so I can achieve my goals.
 ●	About the achievement rate of cloud fundingThe goal is set to $200,000 which is the minimum amount we would need.  The way we transport Ms. Keromi depend on the amount we raise through this campaign.  We can use the safest way to transport Ms. Keromi if we raise more than $ 200,000.  The plan B would cost about $300,000 (150% achievement ratio).  The plan C would cost more than $300, 000.  Please support this project so that we can surely achieve the jump rope demonstration with Ms. Keromi in Hollywood.

95,"Robotics
in industry, education, and personal interests have become an outstanding part
of our lives and are quickly emerging as a factor in the way we will live in
our future. For this reason it is becoming increasingly important to make
robotic products easier to interact with, easier to find, easier to understand,
and easier to purchase. ""As robots take on an increasingly ubiquitous role in society, they must be easy for the average citizen to use and interact with. They must also appeal to persons of different age, gender, income, education, and so forth. This raises the important question of how to properly interface untrained humans with these sophisticated technologies in a manner that is intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use. What might such an interface look like?"" (Cynthia Breazeal, 2002, Massachusetts Institute of Technology) ""G.E.N.E.S.I.S."" is an acronym that stands for: ""General Engineering Network of Electronically Simulated Intelligent Systems"" and is an animatronic head project that is designed to be
interactive with its surroundings via sensors, speech synthesizer, voice
recognition, and a relatively large array of servo-motors. The primary
objective of this project is to create a low-budget android head that may act
as an expandable robotic base for future development.  G.E.N.E.S.I.S. has 16 degrees of freedom (DOF) which are actuated by the sixteen servo motors in the head.  Each servo controls movement of one specific part of the face and head. While it is possible to emulate simple expressions with fewer than sixteen motors, sixteen motors placed strategically can effectively emulate almost every common human expression with a wide range of attitude for each expression such as an open-mouth smile or a wide-eyed wink. The figure below shows the G.E.N.E.S.I.S. prototype expressing various emotional expressions using facial servo motors which control mouth, eye, eye-lid, eye-brow, and head positioning.Some of these servos, such as the ones used for ear, cheek and lip movement, are under-utilized at this stage of development since certain parts of the face are under constant re-design and construction. To supplement a visually interactive face, G.E.N.E.S.I.S. uses a voice synthesizer to emulate a female voice (male voice now available!) . All of the vocal responses are pre-programmed words or statements that are used commonly in human interaction. The current response vocabulary is around one-hundred phrases but is updated and expanded periodically. The system used is a stand-alone EMIC Text-to-Speech module that has been used since the original creation of the project. This system will eventually be phased out and replaced with an integrated voice synthesizer that will draw words and phrases from its voice recognition vocabulary which is controlled by the Parallax Propeller chip. When this stage is implemented, it will have the ability to expand its vocabulary by simply interacting with its user. The extent of the vocabulary could potentially hold several thousand words however, at this point; the vocabulary is limited to around one hundred basic commands used for teaching and debugging purposes. Any funding raised by this campaign will go solely to the further development of this project and its components. Funds will be used for:Raw materials such as ABS plastic, Aluminum, Steel, and assembly hardware (screws, nuts, washers, etc.)Electrical materials such as: circuit boards, wire, solder, electrical components (processors, Integrated Circuits, resistors, capacitors, etc.)Tools such as: precision tools, additional 3d printer, cutting and shaping tools, and electronic test equipment (oscilloscopes, multi-meters, signal generators, etc.)We will also acquire a modest, but functional work space which will allow us to develop our products more effectively and quickly.",Jeffrey Rick,$156,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sat, June 25 2016 2:21 PM UTC +00:00","G.E.N.E.S.I.S. is an affordable, expandable, and interactive robot, w/ sensors, voice recognition, speech, and an array of servo-motors",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,5," ""Estimated delivery: Aug 2016""In time for Halloween.

96,"Our Mission:Create an affordable stable platform for filming that was full featured and outperformed similar quads on the market. After months of testing and revising our design we have achieved success. We have created a super light extremely rigid frame that has superb flight time is easy to repair and takes amazingly stable video. Our complete system weighs in right at 3.5kg and includes a 16ah Li-polly battery, a Pixhawk flight controller, Ublox m8n GPS, Bluetooth telemetry radio, 2 axis Alexmos Gimbal, 500Kv brushless 22 pole motors, 30Amp Simon-k ESC’s, and 15” T-style carbon fiber propellers.
3D printing is actually a good fit for a drone air frame. It has a few unique aspects that you can't get with injection molding. 3D printed objects have a good weight to strength ratio this is due to a honeycomb interior structure. 3D printed objects are built 1 layer at a time allowing for complex shapes that would never release from an injection mold.
Most quads on the market have a 15 to 20 minute flight time can barely carry a GoPro and can only reach speeds of 20MPH. We find that this is unacceptable. With such short flight times, we were finding that we were missing some of the best action. We set out to extend that time, little did we know how far we could go. We almost tripled that time without losing performance or stability. We were able to get up to 40 minutes of smooth uninterrupted flight time and video. Our quad can also reach speeds up to 40 MPH and carry a much heaver DSLR camera with little to no modification. The best part our system is that it uses readily available off the shelf electronics that can be replaced easily for that inevitable crash.That's 120 pounds  Color OptionsWhy Pixhawk:168 MHz / 252 MIPS Cortex-M4F14 PWM / Servo outputs (8 with fail safe and manual override, 6 auxiliary, high-power compatible)Abundant connectivity options for additional peripherals (UART, I2C, CAN)Integrated backup system for in-flight recovery and manual override with dedicated processor and stand-alone power supply (fixed-wing use) Backup system integrates mixing, providing consistent autopilot and manual override mixing modes (fixed wing use)Redundant power supply inputs and automatic fail overExternal safety switchMulticolor LED main visual indicatorHigh-power, multi-tone piezo audio indicatormicro SD card for high-rate logging over extended periods of time      What does all that mean It means it’s a state of the art feature packed fully autonomous flight controller .What it does :It allows you to Get Telemetry data, plan full autonomous missions, do a return to launch in emergency situation, and allows for follow me so you can have your drone automatically follow you for those amazing third person aerial shots all from any android tablet or smart phone.low Battery Return To Launch Or Land Feature Follow Me Mode With Any Android Smart phone Return To Launch With The Flick Of A Switch Fully Stabilized With Altitude Hold And GPS Position Hold  Capable Of 40MPH Up To 40 Min Of Flight TimeFully Autonomous With Programmable Missions Using A PC Or Android Smart phoneRC Remote Or App Based Control Of Vehicle6 Channel 2.4ghz RC Radio With Programmable Push Button 6 Mode Selection 2 Axis AlexMoss Stabilized GimbalFor Go Pro Or Sjcam15” Carbon Fiber T Style Propellers Bluetooth Wireless Telemetry On Your Tablet Or Smartphone  View Flight Path Data In Google Earth  Sjcam 5000Remotely view in HD and control from your smartphone or tablet wit the SJCAM HD APP on the Google play store 2 Axis Gimbal stabilization:What is a gimbal?

When cameras with CMOS sensors are subjected to shaking or vibrations the recorded images are often full of CMOS distortions like wobble, jello, vibration jitter, and skew.These issues are a real challenge for typical video stabilizers, which can smooth bumps and shakes, but can’t do anything for CMOS distortions.

97,"The purpose of this project is to design and develop a robot that will rove an area autonomously using  sensors to guide it.  A micro-controller controls the camera that is equipped with night vision capabilities and connects to the network and internet to stream live video feed that will be viewed by the Operator, and anyone else with access. This can be viewed virtually anywhere in the world from a computer connected to the internet when ported. The Sentry_Bot will allow the user or technician, to set it up in the establishment by initially connecting to it using a PC and connecting it to your LAN. This isn't necessary to see the autonomous functioning, however to view the live video feed it will need to initially be connected to the network (router). After the initialization (given by instruction in the instruction manual), the robot will continuously rove the perimeter guided by its collision detection and avoidance system I refer to as AGS (autonomous guide system).Business automation is one of the fastest growing industries today, and with good reason. Automation such as a climate control and security system make everyday living simpler and safer. Automation, such as washing dishes and clothes can save time and money. After considering the many lacking aspects and menial tasks of everyday life, I have decided to tackle one of the biggest hurdles of everyday life, which is security.
The goal of this project is to create a robot that is capable of providing additional security to any location with boundaries set. The end goal will be that users will simply place the robot in any location with in a set perimeter, and it will autonomously rove its environment. It will continuously transmit live video feed and serial data to the operator. Thus far I have completed a functioning prototype, and am continually testing the integrated systems for both prototypes, and making changes to the code and design as needed to optimize performance. Work still needs to be done to complete this project such as a protective shell for each model, and additional sensors for increased accuracy and performance.

98,"GroundRig is a multi-functional, remote controlled ground vehicle. We, at times, refer to it as a UGV which stands for Un-manned Ground Vehicle.This particular GroundRig, shown in the video, we call Wildlife Edition. This is the first and only UGV we have built so far, and thus has been dubbed our prototype. GroundRig has many possible uses. It can be used for professional inspections,  photography and videography, night filming with infrared or FLIR cameras, search and rescue, wildlife photography and videography, and storm chasing. Who knows, you may have uses we have never even heard of, and if that is the case, we want to hear from you! Our goal is to make many different versions of GroundRig in order to fill the many different needs and uses in the world. This is a condense basic description of what went into making the GroundRig. We basically start with a complex remote controlled vehicle which will vary in scale depending on what the GroundRig will be used for. This GroundRig prototype is a 1/10 scale UGV. Again, for this prototype, we then designed and cut a mounting adapter using CAD software, and with the help of a CNC router we cut the needed parts to attach the gimbal in place and hold other related components. Once the gimbal was installed we balanced and tuned it using the software that comes with it. We programed the transmitter so that the controls are as desired for the operation of the vehicle (right stick controls direction of the UGV, left sticks control gimbal operation). For this prototype, we then went back to our CAD software and CNC router to design a shield which would serve to protect the camera equipment since this prototype was to be used for wildlife photography. We then upgraded  the tires so that it would be able to handle a rougher terrain, soldered wires, installed batteries, installed FPV and installed a screen onto the transmitter. We also modified the suspension so that we could add more weight to the gimbal if we wanted to. After all that, we tested and Voila! We had created our first GroundRig Wildlife Edition. We are wanting to develop many different types of GroundRig. We want to build a GroundRig specifically for inspections, another specifically for weather or storm chasing which would be all weather and water resistant, another for professional photographers and videographers who need to add more weight, and another for search and rescue with infrared technology. We are also looking into adding robotic arms for grabbing things! Research, development, and creating parts for these units is not cheap, and because we are a small group of individuals, we just do not have the capital needed to do all these things. With your help, you would be growing the UGVs capabilities, such as allowing us to research into adding arms to our vehicles to grab objects, expanding their use via autopilots and way points, among other equipment.

99,"One of the most complex areas in robotics and animation is Inverse Kinematics. It is fairly easy to do a forward solution, when movements of the machine elements are known and the final result should be found. More complex task is to specify the final result and find movements of the machine to achieve this result. What is machine? In fact, it can be a robot, a car, a human body, an animal, a game avatar, a prosthesis etc. Anything that requires complex trajectories and precise control.The applications are wide. Some of them are:The problem is, that there is no known approach, which can handle arbitrary machine configuration and do it fast. Either it is a special configuration of the machine like wrist configuration, which has inverse analytical solution, simplifications like in this article or very intensive computations, which take a lot of time.TIME TO MOVE FORWARD!This project is about writing the software that can solve theoretically arbitrary complex machines and do it fast.If you want to understand better what it will be, take a look at the project video. The video shows 2 stages of the work in progress. The first part is a working prototype for the 7-axis industrial robot, written in HTML, Javascript and using a three.js library for rendering. It shows a standard Kuka 7-axis robot. The first part shows forward kinematics, then inverse. In the last part of the video the work in progress is shown over production version of the software, which will allow to create complex machine, calculate their movements based on paths, directions, optimizations, etc. As graphics system Ogre3D project was selected, which is well known in the game industry for its advanced rendering capabilities. Video here shows commercial implementation of the similar algorithm, but with less capabilities and speed than is under development in the proposed project. In fact, the algorithm was successfully tested and used on 12+ axis of Fanuc robot configurations.  The video below shows the work of the commercial implementation of the current algorithm predecessorAnd you can use this example to test the early prototype.Backers of the proposed project will have a chance to make the impossible possible. New amazing games, machines, which cannot be controlled yet, agile robots, sophisticated prosthetics! Don't miss a chance!More information on the elements used in the project, project progress will be available on the MeerCAD site. Project backers and all interested are encouraged to register at this site. Alpha and beta releases will be available there for download, bug reporting and feature request tools. The features will be enabled depending on the supporter level as described in the Rewards section of the project.Features:For the minimal level of funding the following features will be included:Future development will include features like:LIVE EXAMPLES:Chase the ball:Dancing together: PARALLEL CHAINS:Following the question about parallel chain robotics the live example was written:This is a random robotic chain generator with inverse solution. The limit in 200 axis and 50 parallel chains is not really a limit. The browser will not be able to survive with more workload. C++ code is in the development and 1000 axes was successfully tested. Even on the 6-axis robots with wrist configuration solutions was found about 4 times faster, than analytical method allows. There is no limit on both, only computer resources. And the code is here.

100,"  Archer is a revolutionary desktop combat robot controlled by your smartphone or tablet, with a proprietary omnidirectional movement technology. Our robots can move so freakishly fast in any direction because they are equipped with our 3 legs omnidirectional movement Mechanism. The movement control system uses advanced calculations to make sure all of your Archer robot’s movements are quick and coordinated. Your robot is able to move as fast and as freely as you do. The laser weapon, on the right hand, is able to attack targets within 5 meters. The anti-laser shield, on the left hand, can defend the attack from your enemy. We offer several kinds of weapons with different effects in the control APP. You can use varied tactics with these weapons during movement. For better user experience and user interface, we added gravity sensing to the design of the control system, in order to provide a more accurate counting algorithm for its movement. This allows your robot to move naturally and respond precisely to your moving commands. You are able to control it just like driving a drone.  The Archer robot team is dedicated to giving you the most fun, most personalized playing experience. So we’ve made it so that you can design every aspect of your robot’s armor. Your robot will be a true reflection of you. You are able to update your robot by purchasing the latest Archer components or designing and 3D printing by yourself.  Archer robot is equipped with a sensor to detect laser attack. When your robot is shot by other’s laser weapon, the health point is deducted. If your “blood” level reaches zero, you lose the match. Simple as that. Try to control your robot and choose weapons freely to win this game! It’s a good choice to enjoy a robot combat when you need relax from the working pressure. This will make your working environment more avant-garde and have sense of science and technology.  Archer robots are a great hobby for kids and their parents to enjoy together, or have fun with your lovely pets. The App control system, which can be used on IOS/Android, is so intuitive that everybody in the family will be able to enjoy robot fighting action. It is important to mention that Archer robots are 100% safe for young children. Archer is powered by a 3.7V Li-ion rechargeable battery. You can charge the battery through the USB port of the robot, or swap another battery directly to get back to the battle field quickly.   We designed Archer to be simple and elegant, with no comprise on design and details, inspired by the Game and Animation industry, to fully unlock the imagination of our customer.  Archer is much more than a toy.

103,"We are building a real-time, small-parts robotic inspection system.  The prototype has already been built.  We are seeking funds to With the LVR system, a manufacturer can accurately scan parts in production, compare the scans to a reference part and make accurate measurements and calculations in near real time. LVR has a unique, dual comparison system that minimizes the escape rate of defective parts. The scanners are coupled to robots to automate the inspection and measurement process.Pricing is comparable to optical comparators and CMMs without the tedious hand measurement.  Inspection System RenderingOur technology controls a robot arm to position a part — in this case, a bone screw — between a light source and high resolution digital camera. As the robot rotates the screw, the software makes 18 images (every 20 degrees) to create a two-dimensional representation of the screw and compare them to a previously imaged reference, or “golden” screw. As the images are processed, it displays an easy to interpret visual comparison of the reference and part under inspection.The same images are compared against part overlays in an independent inspection step for parts that pass the golden image comparison.  As a result, the defect miss rate is the product of the probability of a miss on the golden image comparison and the probability of a miss on the overlay comparison.  Our dual-inspection software offers an extremely small probability of passing a defect.Our inspection accuracy is +/- 10 pixels with the standard 5 megapixel camera, resulting in a measurement accuracy of .0198mm (.00078″).  For screws, calculations based on pitch, flank angles, and major/minor diameters can replace separate gauging as a measure of pull-out strength.  An auto-calibration cycle can be configured as part of the normal inspection or performed at the discretion of the operator.The hand labor required for current inspection and measurement technologies, and their associated costs, are significantly reduced using the inspection technology.  Our system will cost approximately $75,000 and replace up to 2.5 people while reducing rejects.Integrated measurement means your quality control engineers can make accurate, on screen measurements and include these measurements in the automated inspection protocol.Read more on our website, http://lvrsystems.com",Ernest Ciccone,$207,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Tue, January 20 2015 9:34 PM UTC +00:00",LVR has developed a low cost robotic quality control system for the orthopedic implant marketplace and manufacturers of small parts.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,5," I find your project absolutely intriguing, however I wish there was more support.~  ",0,"$109,000",Robotic Inspection by Ernest Ciccone — Kickstarter

Please allow us to briefly introduce our team. We refer to
our robotic team as the ""Robo Titans"". We are a group of 7 highly motivated 6th
graders who attend Suzanne Middle School in Walnut, California. One of our
primary goals as members of this highly accomplished team is to motivate,
educate, and inspire kids of all ages by sharing the importance of STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) Education for a brighter and
better society of tomorrow. As a group of 7 rising young engineering students,
we have earned one of the top spots from the State of California to represent
the Los Angeles/Santa Barbara First Lego League Region at the 2018 FLL World
Championship. This Championship event showcases Champion Award-Winning teams
from around the world.  It can be
categorized as the “Olympics of the Lego League Robotics World”.  The 2018 FLL World Championship event will
be hosted at the Houston Texas Convention Center in April 2018. The
annual FIRST Championship, presented by Qualcomm Inc., is the culmination for
student teams who participated in regional competitions held around the world. Participation
in the FLL World Championship is quite an accomplishment, and we have worked
very hard throughout the school year to achieve such an amazing opportunity.
Unfortunately the Walnut Valley Unified School District does not benefit from
the type of funding that could financially assist us with this endeavor, and therefore,
our team’s ability to attend this prestigious event is based solely on
fundraising campaigns. We are making every effort to reach out to various
businesses, residents, companies and agencies far and wide throughout many
communities in hopes of seeking sponsors. Our goal is to raise $17,000 to cover
the cost of tournament registration, airfare, lodging and tournament supplies.
This much-needed sponsorship will assist our team in achieving their dream of
attending the 2018 FLL World Championship while also providing us with the
opportunity to share positive experiences with youth from around the world as
we continue our journey of exploration in the fields of engineering, robotics,
programming and various other technological fields.  We appreciate any contribution you can provide.
 What
is FIRST LEGO League?  Tomorrow's innovators practice imaginative thinking and teamwork. Guided by two or more adult Coaches, FIRST LEGO League teams (up to 10 members, grades 4-8*) research a real-world problem such as food safety, recycling, energy, etc., and are challenged to develop a solution. They also must design, build, program a robot using LEGO® MINDSTORMS®, then compete on a table-top playing field.

It all adds up to tons of fun while they learn to apply science, technology, engineering, and math concepts (STEM), plus a big dose of imagination, to solve a problem. Along their journey, they develop critical thinking and team-building skills, basic STEM applications, and even presentation skills, as they must present their solutions with a dash of creativity to judges. They also practice the Program’s Core Values, which emphasize Discovery, Teamwork and Good Sportsmanship.ROBO

About FIRST Robotics CompetitionFIRST LEGO League (FLL) is
a robotics program for 9-to-14 year olds, which is designed to get children
excited about science and technology -- and teach them valuable employment and
life skills. In FLL, children are immersed in real-world science
and technology challenges. The goal of the FLL is to expose students to professions
in computer science and help them discover and develop a passion for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) To learn more about the FIRST LEGO League, please visit: www.firstlegoleague.orgWe will start three FLL robotics teams that will register with the United States FIRST LEGO League. Each team will order a 2014-2015 Challenge field setup kit and a LEGO MINDSTORMS® (robot) set. The teams will design, build, and program their team’s robot. The teams will research for the project and brainstorm ideas for innovative solutions. There will also be a practice scrimmage between the three teams here in Bakersfield before attending our first tournament.There are several upfront costs to starting a team, such as purchasing the LEGO MINDSTORMS® kit and building Robot Game tables, which are one-time expenses. These assets can be reused in subsequent years. There are also recurring expenses, such as National Team Registration, the Challenge field setup kit, tournament fees, and any travel and insurance expenses. This means it costs a little more than $1,600 to start a new team but only about $850 per team per year to keep them going. Our goal is for team members to fund raise throughout the year so that starting in year two we will only need to raise $500 per team per year from our sponsors. Case For ActionAccording to the 2012 Kern Economic Development Corporation Labor Study  only 29% of high school graduates in Kern County were prepared for college. California-wide this figure is substantially higher at 40%. Also, only 41% of young adults aged 18-24 in Kern County have post-secondary training or a degree, which is far lower than the 54% of young adults nationwide that have post-secondary training or a degree. 
In contrast, FLL participants reported being more academically motivated, with 89% more interested in doing well at school and 88% more interested in going to college. FLL participants reported wanting to learn more about science and technology (89%), computers and robotics (93%), and how science and technology could be used to solve real-world problems (88%); 77% reported that they were more interested in a job using science or technology, and 63% said they wanted to become engineers. Over 90% of FLL participants also reported a better understanding of the role of science and technology in solving everyday problems. Over 90% reported gains in life and workplace-related skills including the ability to work with others on a team, find information, manage time, use trial-and-error to solve problems, and make presentations.
The FLL provides a way for upper-elementary and middle school students to explore and learn STEM concepts in a playful, fun, and exciting way. Establishing a network of FLL teams in Bakersfield can help to guide our local youth and future workforce towards careers in STEM-related fields. The FLL also introduces younger students to real-world engineering challenges through building LEGO-based robots to complete tasks on a thematic playing surface. FLL teams, guided by their imagination and adult coaches, discover exciting career possibilities and, through the process, learn to make positive contributions to society.
The FLL Core Values are the cornerstones of the program. By embracing the Core Values, participants learn that friendly competition and mutual gains are not separate goals, and that helping one another is the foundation of teamwork.
In early fall, FLL releases a Challenge based on a real-world scientific topic. Each Challenge has three parts: the Robot Game, the Project, and the FLL Core Values. Teams participate in the Challenge by programming an autonomous robot to score points on a themed playing field (Robot Game), developing a solution to a problem they have identified (Project), all guided by the FLL Core Values. Teams may then choose to attend an official tournament, hosted by FLL Operational Partners. Past Challenges have been based on topics such as nanotechnology, climate, quality of life for the handicapped population, and transportation. By designing Challenges around these topics, participants are exposed to potential career paths within a chosen Challenge topic. In addition to solidifying the STEM principles that naturally come from participating in a robotics program, team members also learn valuable life and employment skills.",Chris Frank,"$2,321","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Fri, May 2 2014 10:31 PM UTC +00:00",Please help us start 3 FIRST Lego League (FLL) teams in Bakersfield that will compete in the Central Valley Robotics tournaments.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,28, ,0,"$5,000",Bakersfield Lego Robotics Teams by Chris Frank — Kickstarter
106,"     This is the ShopArm. It is a 3D printed robot arm that is made with 3D printing components and can be trained using a vision system, speech, or a standard graphical interface.We are on Kickstarter to fund the manufacture of the first round of ShopArms, and pay for the continued growth of the software and design of the ShopArm.At Slant we build robots every day. Industrial robots, home robots, STEM robots. We have worked with or developed all of these.Early in 2016 we were working with a large industrial robot for a client. A behemoth that could kill you if you got too close at the wrong time. While working with this arm and others like it we realized that we could make an arm 10x cheaper and 100x easier to use.Working on that premise, we started developing the ShopArm. A robot for basically anyone, who would like a little physical automation in their life.We had three requirements when we started.We achieved all of these.We identified the components that could make it affordable. We determined the design that would make it reliable. And we found the functionalities that would make it easy and useful.After several months of working on the project on the side we are ready to release the ShopArm into the world. So builders, small business owners, and overworked cookie decorators can start using it.Inspired by 3D printersHave you noticed how you can get a 3D printer for $300? We decided to take a cue from 3D printers when we designed the ShopArm. Inspired by 3D printers, and how they have come to be made affordably, we utilized many of the methodologies and a few of the parts that are used in these machines.3D PrintedWe also decided to utilize 3D printing to manufacture the ShopArm. We have a farm of the printers on hand for just such production so it was a no-brainer. Every plastic component of the ShopArm is 3D printed. And we will be releasing the designs during this campaign.3D printing also has the advantage of making the ShopArm very light, but still strong. The mechanical properties created by good design in 3D printing are great.  Interchangeable GrippersThe ShopArm has one primary gripper. But we have built several others for various tasks.Here are a few.

 Of course there are many others that can and will be created. That's partly why we are releasing the designs to the arm. We can't create all the grippers that people will want, so we will let them build them.Any end effector can be applied in less then a minute with just two screws.  PrecisionThe ShopArm has a repeatability of less than a millimeter (.5 mm to be precise, and getting better). But why does that matter? If you are feeding the fish or topping off drinks at a party your precision just needs to be less than a few inches. Well, in the future we are going to continue to add software to ShopArm, some of that software will allow ShopArm to perform 3D printing and laser engraving, which do need higher precision. It is also nice to take some pride in your work and do a dang good job. The ShopArm software is quick to install and easy to use. It can be installed on Linux or Windows computers in a couple of minutes. From there all you have to do is plug a USB cable into the ShopArm and start using it.  DrawingThe UI of the ShopArm lets you record a few individual waypoints and motions. But if you would like to create a highly custom trajectory, like handwriting, all you have to do is start writing. Click in the workspace of the arm and drag. It will record the drawing. You can't get much easier than that.The only problem thus far has been that the arm is more precise than the user, showing all the imperfections in our writing as we draw with the mouse. We are working on smoothing out the recording as well as adding the capability to import images.  Visual trackingThe UI is pretty easy to use. But it does require that you have a screen nearby. That's a bit unhandy. It is also ungainly to control the arm through a broad range of motions one point at a time. So we have started creating a vision tracking program. All you need is a tracking marker and a few basic gestures to train the arm. It doesn't get much easier than literally showing the arm what you want it to do.SpeechThe Speech module for the ShopArm only has a few simple commands. This was meant to be used by someone who wants a real third hand. Having the ShopArm to move your work to a better position or even hold a camera is incredibly useful. We are all building one for each of our workstations.Playback and LoopingRobots are great at repetitive tasks. So, obviously, we built repetition in. Once you show the ShopArm what you want it to do, you can make it do it for infinity. Maybe you have a a few boxes that need filling, or a bunch of invitations that need stamps. The ShopArm could save you a lot of effort with just a couple minutes of training. Show it what to do and then leave it.The ShopArm is controlled by an Arduino Mega. This keeps the arm simple and easy to modify. The main computer that we use is a Raspberry Pi. But our software can be downloaded onto any Windows or Linux computer.General Specs  $5 - ThanksYou'll get a shout out on Twitter with a thanks for your support.

The main product I want to bring to market are the ""hives"" themselves. The concept is that each 'hive' will act as a recharging platform for 3 or 4 'bees'.  With a combination of laser trip wires and facial recognition capable cameras, the system will be able to respond to threats on its own, with a main security station where a human operator can manually assume control, with a bare minimum of training. In addition to simple cameras, the 'bees' can optionally be fitted with shotgun microphones, additional cameras, or even Less Than Lethal (LTL) weapons platforms, for example a unit mounted with a pepper spray cannon for use in crowd control operations.Overall, i really believe what I'm offering here is a money maker. The market is already well established, and I've personally not seen anyone else offering anything similar. Its an un tapped market with nearly limitless potential. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you decide to join me in building my dream.",Gary Martin,$0,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sun, January 1 2017 3:05 PM UTC +00:00","Beehive Security systems will be a semi-autonomous surveillance and security platform, able to scan and identify objects in real time.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,0, ,0,"$36,000",Beehive Security by Gary Martin — Kickstarter
112,"Meet Growver, the lawn-watering hero your grass has been waiting for. Growver is a robot that attaches to your garden hose. Using its wire sensing technology, Growver intelligently navigates and irrigates your lawn. Water sensors in the robot detect which areas of your yard are dry so Growver can revive them. And with the connected app, you can track how your lawn is doing over time, adjust water levels, and even control Growver remotely.Every other lawn watering device irrigates by spraying water. But sprinkling water through the air is a fundamentally inefficient way to water plants. And there are other issues too, in additional to leaks, over-spray and evaporation, our data shows a 6:1 variation in water coverage.The only way to distribute water efficiently and evenly is to place it directly where it’s needed. That’s what Growver does – by driving back and forth on the lawn and watering a 20-inch (500mm) wide path. First Growver’s sensors guide it along the boundary wire. After watering the perimeter, Growver fills in the entire area using patent-pending sensor technology to follow the wet-dry transition. Measurements from grass moisture sensors and water-flow data let Growver intelligently adjust watering depth. Growver stops automatically when the entire area is watered.Here’s a complete video of a recent test run. Growver takes about 18 minutes to water the 240 sq-ft area. The entire process completes without wasting a drop of water on the pavement. Irregular areas like this are a real problem for sprinklers!There are 3 ways to use Growver:I'm Jon Guy, inventor of Growver and resident of Austin Texas. My experience building robots started in high-school where, for 3 years in a row, I entered robots in the science fair. Now after 20 years developing hardware and software for start-ups and large corporations, I am back in the robot business. It's an exciting time because recent technology advances now enable us to build the robots we used to dream of.
As a homeowner it didn't take me long to figure out that my lawn sprinkler system wasted a lot of water, was costly to maintain, and basically did a poor job of keeping my grass alive. After years of looking at alternatives, it became clear that effective irrigation requires carrying water and placing it exactly where it's needed. Guided by this goal Growver development started in May 2014.Building an entirely new type of product requires a lot of prototypes and what-if testing. The prototype photos tell some that story. Growver is being developed in both hose-attached and hose-less designs. Both approaches work and the hose-attached design is now ready for field testing and production. Growver has already generated a lot of attention. The local news channel has run two stories including Growver and we were also seen nationally on CNBC’s Make Me A Millionaire Inventor Season 1 Episode 4. Until this point I’ve been self-funding Growver. Now, with your support, Growver will move quickly from an invention to your lawn!OperationGrowver is running in yards using the sensors and algorithms we've spent the last 2 years developing.  SoftwareThe Growver mobile app is running on Android and will be released on iOS and Windows phone platforms before we ship. Note too, that all main functions can be started simply by pressing a button on Growver - no mobile device needed!HardwareToday Growver uses the fourth revision of the control board set.Future hardware changes will be minor refinements to the current design. Major items on our to-do list are:
 TestingGrowver's Bluetooth radio lets us stream thousands of data points to a computer for analysis. Other measurements get collected the hard way - by collecting water over a grid in the lawn. The following charts show results conventional in-ground sprinklers (20 mm variation) and for Growver (<5 mm variation). Q: I have a robot lawnmower. Can I use the mower's existing perimeter wire?A: The existing wire can be used if: 1) the distance of the wire to the actual boundary is acceptable (about 10 -in), 2) The Growver Wire Drive Module is used, and 3) The layout ensures the hose will not get stuck.Q: Can Growver navigate around obstacles?A: Growver can detect if he gets stuck and will pause irrigation if that happens. However the lawn area should be clear of obstacles such as toys and large branches. Permanent obstacles should be outside of the perimeter wire loop.Q: Why is a perimeter wire necessary? Why not use GPS?A: While GPS related technologies continue to improve, there are no appropriately priced systems that can consistently provide the sub-1-inch accuracy needed for lawn robots. Attempts to make a lawn mowing robot without a boundary wire have been largely unsuccessful. Perimeter wires provide a reliable, well-defined boundary to keep robots on-task and out of trouble!",Revely,"$4,884","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Thu, May 12 2016 1:30 AM UTC +00:00",Growver saves water by precisely and intelligently irrigating as it navigates your lawn.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,36, This is a great idea.~  ,0,"$100,000",Growver: Lawn Watering Robot by Revely — Kickstarter

114,"            History Of Aeroponics      Aeroponics is a technique of growing plants without the help of soil. The plants are suspended in mid air and they are supplied with nutrients by using a spray that ha water in it. When the roots absorb oxygen they also absorb all the essential nutrients through the spray. Scientists have observed that the plant growth in the system of aeroponics is ten times higher than the soil method. Soil only plays a role of storage house of nutrients for the plant and the roots absorb them. If the nutrients can be provided to the roots through some other means, then we do not need the soil. A system like aeroponics is useful because plants can be grown in arid landscapes like the desert. The system of aeroponics was first developed by scientists in 1920. Botanists actually observed that the absence of soil promoted plant growth in many ways. Also, it was much simpler to observe the plant growth in this system. However, in 1920 it was just an academic study. In 1970, hydroponics was also developed and both the systems were first put into use. Hydroponics is actually an offshoot of aeroponics. However, aeroponics made a big debut in 1982 when an entire set up was made in Disney Epcot Center. Also, NASA took a special interest in it because it has several uses for this system.Why grow your food     Growing food crops on rooftops and in apartments, to use another example, reveal some obvious advantages. Growing one's own food has become increasingly attractive as food prices have increased, but those same food prices are based on an environmental threat. Let us explain: Each food item has a transportation cost, the amount of money and resources dedicated to moving it from its area of origin to your dinner table. Many involved in the urban gardening movement believe that local food production cuts down on both prices and environmental impact. It takes a lot of carbon dioxide emissions to move a grapefruit from Florida to New York; growing food locally -- especially in a communal aeroponic system in an apartment building -- reduces those impacts dramatically.Water has also become a point of contention among humans in the 21st century. About 70 percent of the water consumed by humans is used for agriculture, and about 45 percent of that is lost due to shoddy irrigation techniques [source: UNESCO, WAPA]. Aeroponics' use of water, in an enclosed system that recirculates it, drastically cuts down on water consumption by as much as 98 percent [source: NASA].Aeroponic systems cut costs like water, fertilizer, and soil: Ultimately, all you need is the nutrient solution and the water required to mix it. It also reduces space requirements.ReferencesRocket Swag. (2017, 5 5). Retrieved from http://www.rocketswag.com/gardening/Hydroponics/aeroponics/History-Of-Aeroponics.htmlWikipedia. (2017, 5 5).

115,"What Is E-Bot ?E-bot is short for educational robots. It is a simple programmable robot that wirelessly connects and controls from any android device, E-Bot is Arduino based that uses an app for control and learning. The goal of E-Bot is to achieve a level of stimulation for our users who are interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. E-Bots stand for communication, learning and fun!What's Included In E-Bot ?Hi! Kickstarter, We Need Your Help And Here's Why :)Ever wanted a robot  but couldn't afford it because they seemed too expensive.The OpenSource educational swarm robot is a project that will make well researched and highly developed robots cheaper and more affordable at the lowest possible prices. The programmable robots can be built from surrounding objects found in an average home using arduino, mod kit micro and babuino wireless micro-controllers with ported user interface design onto an android smartphone device for wireless control and programming.  Mostly the behavior of the programmable robot will be determined off the android device with Scratch and StarLogo programming languages.Our vision of the project is to have educational robots available to users in every home, workplace, educational institution, worship centres worldwide by 2020. To address the silent epidemic but ever soaring drop-out rates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs because colleges and universities have become too boring for students and young teens because the world around them is accelerating technologically at a faster rate than the four-walls of the institution, there should be a balance and this should retain students in school when faced with challenges that may seem appealing but instead are detrimental to the future of education. The robot will help in areas that the targeted user is lacking such as aiding in mathematical proficiency for aspiring engineering users, but who go into college and find out they should have had a stronger mathematical background before enrolling for engineering school. The robot will teach and educate the user long before they become engineers to prepare them through fun and interactive means of learning in core mathematics curriculum. Help Students like KevinOne reason for this is, there was once a student; Kevin who aspired to study engineering at the university level, but had foregone core advanced mathematics during high school when he enrolled into college, Kevin struggled all through the term trying to reach the cut-off score to be admitted into the university to study engineering, Kevin never made it into the university to study engineering but later switched to a different degree program. However, the major problem was that he lacked the mathematical proficiency to survive in college, this is what the robot will face, it'll will ground the user from basic to complex mathematical skills to suit the users preference to build the user from ground up, it'll monitor and enhance the user's progress in these technical areas by using fun and interactive ways that will appeal to the user more than ever before and increase the user's learning experience.  HOW IT WORKSThe Open-Source educational Robot tends to the the problems of mathematical proficiency, coding basics and engineering principlesThe programmable robot or etoy as a means to explore mathematics. Research has proven that programmable robots can instill mathematical interest in young kids from ages four to eight years old.The idea is to entice users from a tender age to cultivate the love for a subject such as mathematics. To achieve this goal mathematical packages will be programmed into the robot to demonstrate in real-time. These subjects will be chosen to create value in the user's learning experience in areas such as shapes, geometry and trigonometry. As a result, the robot will be able to demonstrate simple geometric shapes that the user can program into the robot.The use of educational programming languages which have a simple and visual programming effect on the user such as Scratch and StarLogo visual programming languages will be used to develop basic programming principles in the user which will be ported onto the android device so that users can program the behaviour of the robot with these simple tools.Simple machines and basic mechanics will be the subject of choice, the subject will be taught in physical and visual forms using the combination of the robot and the software program so that the user gets a realistic application of the concept being described.The programmable robot will also serve as a companion that connects with
 peers who have the same robot so a robot social network online 
community easily accessible from any computer communication device allows the users to have fun and extend communication between other to exchange information and 
increase each others learning progress through peer-to-peer collaboration as the robots evolves with the user.We have a clear cut vision with a concise mission and for the first time programmable robots are being used to imbibe education and none of these can be achieved without your help to reach our goal.

120,"Do you or your kids love Legos and toy cars? I do. I especially love to play with Lego Mindstorms, including NXT, the earlier version, and EV3, the newer version. Lego Mindstorms are powerful and multifunctional. If you own a Lego Mindstorms, do you like to use the parts to create a new kind of Lego car? By doing so, you will be able to not only have fun playing with your new Lego car, but also enjoy learning making and programming by doing.For many kids (and adults), learning making and programing can be boring. If your child is one of them, you are not alone. In particular, many kids have not discovered their joy and talents in electronics and programming. As parents and teachers work very hard to get more kids interested in being a maker, and/or programmer, there is an urgent need for kids-appropriate and fun ways to help ignite and sustain kids’ interest in electronics and programming. This will ultimately allow them to discover their talents and imagination to generate innovative ideas and create better products for the future. To meet such need, we created WiCarL, a DIY Wi-Fi controlled Lego car, using IoT (Internet of Things) and a specialized iPhone App.WiCarL, the DIY Wi-Fi-controlled Smart Lego car, is a new kind of toy car. With WiCarL, you get to have fun in creating your own toy car, and learning making and programming, and ultimately playing with your own toy car. You can control the car using voice or buttons using a dedicated iPhone App.Legos and cars are among the most popular toys for kids. They are the favorite for millions of kids. To add fun for kids in learning programing and making, we utilize IoT and create WiCarL (stands for WiCar Lego), a DIY kit including a hardware set and a specialized iPhone App to control DIY Lego cars through a Wi-Fi network. To control WiCarL, kids can use iPhone through the iOS WiCar App, a free App available in Apple Store for download. In the WiCar app, you can control your own Lego car in 2 ways: (1) by using buttons, or (2) through voice control. WiCarL is currently compatible with the Mindstorms NXT and EV3 motors.No gaming or driving skills required. WiCarL is easy to use. It uses an iPhone with the WiCar App installed. You can follow the instructions in the App and the kit, and will be ready to play with your DIY WiCarL within minutes. The WiCar App provides the following functions: voice control, speed control, and programmability.Versatile designWiCarL is compatible with both EV3 and NXT Lego Mindstorms motors. You can build your WiCarL using either version. WiCarL has built-in Lego cable connectors.
 
You can also create your own Lego chassis using your selected motors to have desired features. For example, you can add phone holders for video recording, platforms for holding weight, or a platform for your controller. WiCarL uses tank style controlling, not steering. Keep this in mind when making your chassis.
  Simple to make and use
WiCarL is very simple to assemble and use. The main components are the motors and the controller. The setup is easy too. Hook up the battery and the motors, download and open the WiCar app, and play.  
  Programmable
You can type in the code in the WiCar App to control the WiCarL. The WiCar app is available in Apple Store for free download. It lets kids (and adults) to learn programming and electronics. The Car is also programmable through the arduino IDE. 
Wi-Fi control
Wi-Fi has several advantages over other communication ways such as Bluetooth. For example, Bluetooth is only for one-on-one device communication within a shorter range (e.g., less than 30 feet), whereas Wi-Fi can wirelessly control and connect multiple devices with a greater range (e.g., up to 300 feet) through the Internet. Wi-Fi offers more flexibility for range requirement between WiCarL and the iOS device. It is also possible to control the car with more than 1 phone.Technology
WiCarL uses Wi-Fi enabling technology and App to control a DIY Lego car within a Wi-Fi network range. (This means that it is possible to control WiCarL through a wall!) This is the result of two years of development and testing. 

 
Jeffrey Huang, a maker and developer since he was 10 years old, is the developer of WiCarL. He is a big fan of remote-controlled cars and Legos. But he wanted to make his own car that can be controlled by newer technology and programmable. So he decided to make a Wi-Fi-controlled Lego car, WiCarL. He has two Apps in App Store. He also runs a Youtube channel on iOS programming (https://www.youtube.com/user/JeffreyApp). Jeffrey had so much fun in developing the App (software) and the WiCarL hardware. He looks forward to sharing his excitement and fun with other kids and adults. WiCarL is self-financed.After about two years of development and testing, we have created a functional prototype for WiCarL. We have developed the WiCar App, available in Apple Store for free download. The next stage is to improve the design by reducing the cost and size of WiCarL controller and add more functions to WiCarL, such as additional sensors and cameras.

122,"     A controller moves his/her instrumented hands, and on a TV screen, watches  a robot’s hands duplicate the actions of his/her instrumented hands. This extends the manipulative  ability of  the human’s hands to a remote clone’s, enabling thousands of military and civilian tasks to  be performed remotely.      Development of a system to do this has lagged because capturing the complex motions of the human hand was seen as technically daunting. In particular, the problem of tracking the position of all the joints of a hand in action, with any kind of precision, was not solved. The use of resistant gum and other solutions across the joints did not give consistent results and required constant calibration.     To solve this problem I have invented a small sensor that treats the joint as an isosceles triangle, establishes its base dimension and measures its height. From  these measurements the angle of the joint is easily calculated and provides a standard language for programming diverse robot hands.      With the problem of tracking joint positions solved by my invention, the more significant hand motions can now be sensed and copied. To demonstrate this I have developed a crude but functional control console.  
	It is instrumented to produce electrical data defining a controller’s hand configurations and their hand positions relative to the controller’s body.      	I now need to manufacture a sophisticated  prototype I can use in demonstrating its use.  It can be something simple, like using a robotic hand to manipulate a computer mouse, or to pick up, turn, or move things.      Because precision linear measurement sensors for machine tools are very expensive, I am seeking $30,000 to construct a basic demonstration prototype.

124,"Our vision is to prepare and motivate next generations of researchers, engineers, and scientists using robotics.- Dr. Gottfried Koppensteiner, COO of PRIAWe developed Hedgehog to be simple, flexible and affordable. The Hedgehog Educational Robotics Controller is the centerpiece of this platform, that you combine with your smartphone or computer. Its simplicity makes it suitable for beginners, and Hedgehog is powerful enough to grow with your needs.We are the Practical Robotics Institute Austria (PRIA) located in Vienna, Austria. We are an independent non-profit organization with the aim to promote scientific and technical excellence in schools. To do so, we use robotics in education and various research projects, where we involve students with exciting scientific and engineering topics.Most robotics controllers on the market are „black boxes“: You can't see what's inside, and how the thing works. That's okay for beginners, but if you hit a limit, there's not much you can do. Hedgehog is not like that: from case to software, the controller is open for you to explore and tinker with. Another key differentiator to other robotics platforms is the closely integrated debugging functionality: from within the Hedgehog app, you are able to manually pause the execution of your program, set breakpoints and take a look at current variable values. Whether you want a controller that just works, or customize every last part, whether you’re a beginner or a pro: Hedgehog is for you! If you have a smartphone, you are in good company. Most people today have smartphones, so why not use them for new exciting stuff! We’ve set ourselves the goal to provide an intuitive and handy user experience for the Hedgehog Controller. Since robots tend to move a lot, we decided for a remote user interface – an app on the smartphone or similar devices – instead of an integrated display.
Smartphones provide a rich user interface via touch screen, internet access as well as a variety of built-in sensors that can even be used as part of the robot or for remote controlling it. All these features open up a wide area of applications in and beyond education. These benefits make Hedgehog a worthwhile long term investment.Hardware ControllerSoftware ControllerMiscAt the moment, we have several working prototypes: We can deliver the controller as seen in the promotion video.

125,"  When you design robots using Arduino, you will certainly need lots of components. This will imply dozens of connections, lots of cables, and several modules that will require proper mounting. As you know, the more complex the project, the more likely you are to make mistakes possibly damaging your equipment, and losing valuable time understanding where that unconnected pin should go!This motherboard is designed to be mounted on top of Arduino Mega (or its clones).  If your Mega stops working for any reason, you can just mount this on top of a different Mega (the Mega is not included in this campaign)We designed this board aiming at people building their own robots, and it includes:The 12V input is assumed. You can operate the motherboard without it, but you won't certainly be able to: use the mosfet, drive the servos, move the DC motors, move the stepper motor. The assumption of 12V appears because for robotic applications you will typically need 12V DC motors.We have all experienced the situation of starting a project and then not remembering how all those cables should be connected. This is true specially for small robotic applications - where you need DC motors, communications, servos, current sensing, etc. Our idea is to ensure maximum applicability (no need to remember which pin was doing what?). Since everything here is internally connected, you just connect, load your program using our library and you are ready to go.  The DC motors, servos, and stepper motor are not included.In the video you can see how the library looks like. It's essentially a couple of C headers that you can include in your Arduino environment, As you can imagine, the great thing is that you don't need to edit the pin numbers, as everything is internally connected (unless you are attaching extra things).We plan to allocate 2 small extra pre-production runs, fine tuning some things, possibly adding some proper fuses, and achieving a more rugged design. We MIGHT add a Wifi module and two extra servos, but that will depend on several factors, and we cannot commit to that.Naturally, the more successful the campaign is, the more components we can order our PCB manufacturers to assemble by themselves (not only is that more ""appealing"" visually, but it also reduces the amount of errors (and hence cost).We might decide to add new capabilities to the motherboard (maybe an extra sensor or something along those line). We will certainly try to minimise the changes to the current appearance.  My long term goal is to manufacture non-expensive motherboards for Arduino that facilitates replicating projects (that feeling when you don't remember how you were connecting those cables...) and helps you maintain a clean hardware development cycle.The next version will have 40+ servo control, two - dual channel DC drivers (4 motors), and a WIFI module. It will be at least 30% larger in size.In the video, the IRF540 mosfet is not active/connected in the video, as I added that later based on the feedback of some hobbyists.

126,"ETV launched over three years ago in Alamogordo, NM, focused on the development of ""Robotics for Humankind"" in areas including precision agriculture, environmental management, and infrastructure inspection. Our goal is to design, produce, and safely integrate robotic solutions to address challenges being faced in everyday life.The AGRowBot is the first robot in a family of ground and air platforms to support the small and medium-sized farmer, the backbone of rural communities across the United States. America's small farms are disappearing at an alarming rate, and it is having an adverse impact on our rural communities.The AGRowBot has been in development since the Summer of 2016 and will address critical issues facing the small farmer such as the availability of labor and the cost of production. The AGRowBot will provide the farmer with real-time crop assessment to identify weeds, pests, disease, and nutrition requirements. Because the assessment is at the plant level, fertilizers and pesticides can be applied only where needed, lowering the cost of the crop and minimizing the environmental impact. Additionally, plans can be constructed to direct farmhands to where weeds need to be removed.We've formed a dedicated AGRowBot product team that works from our ETV HQ in Alamogordo, NM to design, manufacture, ship, and support the robots. The combination of the dedication of our internal R&D team (many of whom were originally ETV interns) and our experienced manufacturing and support team ensures the AGRowBot will meet customers needs now and in the future. Software and Embedded Systems TeamJoey Cahill (system architecture and navigation), Alex Martinez (artificial intelligence and vision), and Jordan Michael (graphical user interface and farm planning tools) are graduates of New Mexico State University in Computer Science. They've been a part of ETV, first as interns, and now as the systems development team. Jordan Gonzalez is our newest software intern attending New Mexico State University.Hardware and Production TeamRichard Kernohan, Carter Taylor, Daniel Contreras, and Sandoval Begay lead the hardware development and production operations team. Each has 10+ years of industry experience in hardware layout (mechanical and electrical) and design for production. They will be optimizing the platform electronics for size, weight, and power, and developing the production line to ensure a quality product is delivered. CommunicationsAmanda Hudson will be leading the Kickstarter communications and AGRowBot marketing efforts. Amanda will ensure that Kickstarter supporters are regularly informed of the project's progress and maintain the development board for the AGRowBot community.Your support is vital for the transition of the AGRowBot from prototype to production.

127,"Sentribots use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect potential threats and to raise an alarm without any human supervision. Sentribots  are not robots, they are inanimate, stationary devices strategically placed as an effective look-out and also give the impression that there is someone there.Sentribot sensors combined with Artificial Intelligence collectively assist in identifying potential threats. They are an Internet of Things technology whereby sensor data from multiple sensors is captured and processed in real time, 24/7/365.   Applications include home security, property protection, car theft deterrent, autonomous Security Guards for retail, Banks, Jewellery stores or protecting anything of value. Over 40% of burglaries happen to properties even with traditional security systems installed if no-one is there, however, less than 1% of burglaries happen when someone is watching. Sentribot is that someone. Research has shown that machines are better at identifying objects than humans and this has been demonstrated by autonomous self-driving vehicles. Sentribot is reusing this AI technology for crime prevention.Sentribots do not perform face recognition nor does Sentribot have access to Government or Private faceprint databases. 
 Sentribot identifies threat situations or objects in real time in order to prevent crime. For example, someone entering a shop wearing a balaclava or carrying something identified as a weapon, or something that is out of place, like carrying a hammer into a Pharmacy. Sentribot threat detection is neutral in that it does not discriminate between race, gender, clothing, age, or any other social profiling. However, a covered face or motorcycle helmet inside a shop will raise an alert. We are aware of the potential for AI to be misused, however, prevention is better than cure and typically its human beings that are more dangerous than AI.  Sentribot has gone back to the drawing board to re-imagine the future of autonomous security. We plan to build the ultimate security appliance by using the latest technologies and the most innovative ideas. Sentribot will be a Cloud connected autonomous device using Artificial Intelligence that will continuously look, listen and learn about its environment so that it can detect anomalies, obvious threats, and identify objects that are out of place. Over time we will develop a threat detection database that combines the collective knowledge gathered from all Sentribots. Potential applications include;Security Guards need more help than ever before. Sentribot provides augmented reality support in real time and based on actual local video streams that the security guard may not be able to see. The web based control panel also allows you to see what your Sentribot sees, perform remote control, remote configuration, check status and make connections to other Sentribots.
Sentribots solve the security problems of…We have decided to make Sentribot an open source project for anyone to get involved and contribute. Sentribots rely on open source and programmable API and SDK that make it a great development platform for anyone wanting to explore machine intelligence, IoT and image processing with all of their potential applications. Registered Developers will get access to all project resources and become part of the Sentribot team as we collectively innovate towards the best possible solution.Sentribot is the ideal learning platform as well as a showcase for innovative solutions to the complex world of security. There is no end to improvements and additional capability enhancements and we look forward to your contribution to the Sentribot project. Sentribot includes cameras, sensors, powerful on-board image processing computer, WiFi, Wireless Broadband (4G) and runs Linux OS. Sentribot Artificial Intelligence (AI) is based on Intel OpenCV and Google Tensorflow, two very popular high performance Computer Vision and Neural Network libraries for AI applications.Sentribot is fully integrated with Amazon Cloud and incorporates Internet of Things (IoT) ""at the edge"" processing. This means that Sentribot can be easily programmed to incorporate new sensors, features and functions without interruption to operations. Sentribot IoT capabilities can be extended to incorporate other IoT sensors via wireless networking. Since Sentribot is the wireless network so connectivity cannot be lost due to power outages.Sentribot is more than a security guard. Thanks to its on-board artificial intelligence and open source APIs and Cloud connectivity, Sentribot can be remotely controlled or run autonomously.Sentribot utilises Artificial Intelligence to perform computer vision tasks in order to identify potential threats. The concept is similar to an anti-virus you might run on your PC where known threats have been identified and made available via a threats database. In the case of Sentribot, we are dealing with real-time real-life threats in the physical world. Sentribot utilises an array of sensors to identify threats. These sensors include smoke detection, presence, proximity, daytime vision, night vision, movement detection, shock, vibration, magnetic fields, light level, sound, thermal imaging (optional), humidity, water, gases, heat and more if required. Sensor arrays can also be extended via remotely positioned Sentribot Orb's. This provides both redundancy and increased detection range.  Sentribot is a completely new take on the security industry. The challenge is to shrink this technology and wrap it inside a protective shell as an ultra-low power IoT solution.One of the biggest problems with traditional security cameras is that the resolution is too low. For High Definition cameras the best performance is typically 6 pixels per degree of Field of View (FoV). Can you identify a person with only 6 pixels ?Sentribots patented and low cost camera technology delivers higher resolution than the human eye in all directions across 360 degrees (over 60 pixels per degree). Higher resolution is crucial for both people or Artificial Intelligence to accurately identify objects and people. Other problems with traditional security cameras include high cost of installation, continuous high bandwidth communications back to a monitoring centre and reliance on people recognise threats. Sentribot processes all data locally and only escalates alarms when it detects a threat. This means that there is no requirement for high bandwidth communications and it can operate at much lower power consumption, has no installation cost, can be moved to different locations easily and runs autonomously 24/7/365. Sentribot is the result of extensive research and development and is protected by multiple patents.

The conference gathers various industry representatives and schools from the southeast region of the United States.Our IEEE robotics team each year takes on the task of building a fully autonomous robot to compete at SoutheastCon. Under strict rules, and limited resources; our team is challenged to raise funds, hone in on teamwork skills, and design, build, and program an autonomous robot to perform the prescribed tasks of the competition. In five short months, we met our goal of designing, programming and engineering a competitive robot even though we did not have a workshop or a dedicated build room. By competing in SoutheastCon 2017, we learned that collaboration is essential to innovation, developed confidence in our critical thinking skills, motivated one another to work hard and learned to remain resilient through every small and large failure by confronting each obstacle with a tenacity that served to strengthen our team’s resolve.Some of our goals for this year: We need the help of individuals and organizations to provide our team with financial support and mentor-ship. With financial aid from our partners we may continue to provide this unique learning opportunity and innovative co-curricular program. Financial assistance goes directly to our team’s registration fees and construction expenses. Our team’s primary asset is the dedication and enthusiasm of our students. However, since we do not have a dedicated build room to construct a competitive robot, we require additional parts, equipment, and a large rolling tool box to store our materials. In addition, we will require help from mentors whose knowledge we can draw upon when designing and building our robot. Mentors in the areas of STEAM and business have the experience and expertise to help us with the challenges that arise during construction of the robot and in fundraising to expand our robotics program.Building an autonomous robot can be very costly, but it also provides a great hands-on learning experience for our team. We have already secured some funding, however in order for our team to make it to competition more funding is required for building materials, and travel for the team. Our team hopes to forge lasting relationships between sponsors and young people who are highly driven and passionate about science and technology. By sponsoring our team, financially or through mentorship, your organization will create opportunities for our team to develop 21st century work skills. Sponsoring our team would also provide a lot of exposure for your organization. This year, our team will be one of 100 teams from over 10 states competing in St. Petersburg, Florida. All teams, including mentors, parents, and spectators will be exposed to your company name and logo.This is also a great opportunity for us to represent FAU in a large scale at a well known conference.

A la clé : gloire, renommée et un pied dans l’avenir ! 4- Les Circuits : Volez ! Coursez ! Freeridez !  DROBOT X propose différents terrains de jeux pour faire voler votre appareil: zones libres, circuits, parcours d’obstacles. Chaque terrain dispose d’un GPS indoor permettant de suivre chacun des drones et d’obtenir de nombreuses statistiques de vol disponibles sur internet grâce à l’application pour mobile DROBOT X. Que vous soyez débutant ou pilote chevronné vous trouverez chez DROBOT X le terrain qu’il vous faut.Le marché des drones et robots de loisir est en pleine expansion mais il est confronté à deux problématiques : d’une part, la prise en main demande un apprentissage et un accompagnement, d’autre part le pilotage de drones en extérieur est soumis à une législation stricte. Souhaitant palier à ces deux problématiques, DROBOT X va ouvrir un espace intérieur ludique spécialement conçu pour ce type d'apprentissage et de jeux. De plus, grâce à son approche ludique, éducative et collaborative, DROBOT X a pour objectif de fédérer les communautés de la robotique et des technologies du futur, d’être un lieu structurant pour les filières robot et drone et de favoriser les vocations et les compétences de demain. DROBOT X a recueilli de nombreux soutiens favorables de la part de spécialistes du milieu de la robotique et de l'aéronautique. Le projet a suscité l’intérêt de nombreux industriels et a reçu l'aide aussi bien d'acteurs publics que privés. Nous avons besoin encore de 125 K€ minimum pour ouvrir le premier park, c'est pourquoi nous comptons sur votre contribution. Nous avons également besoin de communiquer sur notre projet et nous avons constaté sur les salons et rencontres que l'intérêt du grand public pour les drones et robots ne cesse de croître. Une campagne Kickstarter nous permet d'être au plus près de cette communauté d'utilisateurs croissante, dynamique et en forte demande de lieux dédiés à la pratique. Avec votre aide, vos avis et la passion que nous partageons tous pour le monde des robots, nous pouvons créer la première salle française entièrement conçue pour la robotique. Cette salle sera un endroit unique en France et répondra à tous les besoins de la communauté. L'ouverture de cette salle ne sera que le début de l'experience DROBOT X. Nous avons de nombreux plans pour le futur (nouveaux terrains, nouveaux appareils, nouvelles salles) que nous sommes impatients de vous dévoiler. Cette campagne Kickstarter est le début d'une longue aventure pour vous et pour nous.Elle se décompose en trois étapes :Start pour 125K € collectés : ouverture du DROBOT X park en août-septembre 2017 - 1060 m2 + l'application DROBOTXNiveau 1 pour 250K € collectés : ouverture du DROBOT X park en août-septembre 2017 - 1060 m2 + application DROBOT X avec statistique + 600 m2 avec deux terrains supplémentaires de jeux en équipes (drones et robots)Niveau 2 pour 500K € et plus collectés : ouverture du DROBOT X park en août-septembre 2017 - 1060 m2 + application DROBOT X + 600 m2 avec deux terrains supplémentaires de jeux en équipes (drones et robots) + vol assisté Situé à Mérignac à proximité de l'aéroport de Bordeaux, l’établissement DROBOT X d’une capacité d’accueil à l'ouverture de 195 personnes est à deux pas du tram A et dispose d’un parking gratuit. La salle de 1060 m² avec possibilité d’extension supérieure à 3000m² propose plusieurs terrains modulables permettant de s’adonner à différentes activités. Un espace convivial doté d’un bar permet aux utilisateurs de se relaxer entre deux sessions et un FabLab-boutique permet d’assembler et réparer des appareils, acheter du matériel ou recevoir des conseils techniques auprès de nos spécialistes.Venez découvrir les sensations du pilotage ou de la programmation robotique dans un lieu spécialisé et une atmosphère futuriste inspirée de la science-fiction : Star Wars, Tron ou encore Blade Runner.A l’ouverture DROBOT X proposera deux espaces de vol modulables et un espace robot. Grâce à une hauteur sous plafond de 9m, DROBOT X utilise tout le volume disponible pour permettre aux pilotes d’exprimer le plein potentiel des appareils. Chaque terrain est entouré de filets pour assurer la sécurité du public. Venez seul ou en groupe découvrir le pilotage de drone et la robotique.

 L’établissement sera équipé d’un système de localisation indoor permettant de suivre très précisément chaque appareil qu’il soit le vôtre ou de location et ce sur n’importe quel terrain. Ce système permet d’assurer la sécurité du public et du matériel mais aussi de réaliser de nombreuses statistiques de vol.
 La volièreLa volière est une zone d’apprentissage encadrée par des moniteurs agréés et permettant de découvrir le pilotage que ce soit seul ou en groupe. Cet espace entouré de filets dispose de quelques obstacles où les débutants peuvent s’exercer à effectuer les manœuvres les plus basiques.Zone FPV Volez dans une atmosphère unique, les obstacles et le circuit mettront à rude épreuve votre agilité et vos réflexes. Fumigènes, obstacles mobiles, virages en épingle et dénivelés sont autant d’éléments qu’il vous faudra dompter si vous voulez triompher. Grâce à la caméra embarquée du drone faites le plein de sensations fortes dans vos lunettes.A la fin de la course vos statistiques seront disponibles sur internet via l’application mobile DROBOT X. Temps au tour, position sur le tracé, vitesse, replay, consultez vos performances et comparez-les à celles de vos adversaires. Observez votre progression à chaque session et devenez un expert en pilotage.Zone de vol libreLes terrains de DROBOT X sont modulables. Il est donc possible de les combiner et d’offrir une grande zone de vol libre. En vol à vue ou FPV, virevoltez librement d’un bout à l’autre de l’établissement, franchissez les obstacles et amusez-vous.Espace robotsL’espace robots est dédié à la robotique et à la programmation. Cette zone dispose de différents robots ludiques avec des jeux d'oppositions, d'équipes, de balles et des parcours d'obstacles.Accessible seul ou en groupe, cette zone permet d’apprendre la robotique en s’amusant et de développer de véritables compétences en programmation.L’Alpha-1 est le drone qui nous sert de plateforme test pour le DROBOT X park. Nos drones de location seront adaptés à un vol indoor : plus petits et préprogrammés pour une prise en main immédiate.Grâce aux différents modes de difficulté bridant la puissance de l’appareil, voler n’a jamais été aussi simple. Les débutants peuvent s’initier sur nos drones et progresser étape par étape jusqu’à devenir de véritables As du pilotage !
Le vol assisté est une innovation DROBOT X et permet à une unité centrale de contrôler les déplacements du drone et de corriger la course de l’appareil en cas de sortie de zone. Lorsque le drone s’approche d’une zone interdite, il freine et laisse la possibilité au pilote de regagner la zone de vol autorisée. Si celui-ci ne change pas sa trajectoire alors l’unité centrale prend le contrôle et regagne automatiquement l’espace de vol. Ce dispositif permet ainsi de protéger public et matériel.Grâce au compte DROBOT X créé lors de l’inscription il est possible de personnaliser les contrôles et de les garder tout au long de votre progression.Nao

 L’établissement DROBOT X est ouvert à tous, seul ou en groupe. Des plages horaires sont réservées en journée pour les écoles et à midi et en soirée pour les particuliers.L’innovation est un point essentiel pour le développement de DROBOT X. D’une part pour améliorer le confort d’utilisation des appareils, la sécurité du public et du matériel et d’autre part pour créer de nouvelles applications et terrains de jeu. 

 La première phase de recherche est en cours et se terminera d’ici le deuxième trimestre 2017. Elle concerne la mise en place du vol assisté par ordinateur permettant à une unité centrale de prendre le contrôle d’un appareil en cas de sortie d’une zone de vol autorisée.
La deuxième phase concerne le traitement des interférences en vue FPV au-delà d’une vingtaine de drones. Suite à ces recherches il sera possible d’augmenter le nombre de drones en vue FPV et d’améliorer le confort de pilotage.

Ces deux phases de recherche sont les bases pour les prochains travaux de recherche de DROBOT X qui permettront de proposer de nouvelles applications et terrains de jeu toujours plus sensationnels au public.
L’aventure DROBOT X a commencé en décembre 2015. Parti du constat simple qu’il n’existait pas de lieu permettant le pilotage de drones ou de la programmation de robots, l’idée d’une salle dédiée a évolué pour parvenir au projet que nous vous présentons aujourd’hui. 
 L’architecture du logiciel de localisation et de statistique est prête. L’alpha-1 est une bête de course ultra maniable et facile à prendre en mains. Et nous avons noué de nombreux partenariats afin que l’expérience DROBOT X soit unique : éclairage,  décors, robots, drones. 
 Aujourd’hui nous faisons appel à vous pour que ce projet unique puisse voir le jour.

The event is April 2-4, 2015 at the George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston, TX.We are in our third year as participants in the FIRST Robotics Competition. It is costly to maintain our team due to competition entry fees, buying robot parts (motors, servos, computers, gears, raw material, etc.), travel, and other expenses. The money spent for these items is ultimately used to ""build"" future engineers, scientists, mathematicians and other STEM careers. Jersey Voltage students learn real-world engineering skills while building the robot. We are exposed to real-world challenges, including: As you know, these skills are the same type of skills that Makers and Kickstarters LIKE YOU already have. It is our goal that the Jersey Voltage students will become tomorrow's innovators! Your Kickstarts will be greatly appreciated. The game challenge for each season is completely different from one year to the next. The following video explains the challenge that our students will have to overcome during the 2015 season, called Recycle Rush:During the 2014 season, Jersey Voltage were semi-finalists at the Lonestar Regional out of approximately 55 teams. The year prior, our Rookie Year, our team was the ""Highest Rookie Seed"" team. We also received many awards, including ""Rookie of the Year"" and the ""Creativity Award.""

XROBOX is a producer of smart software and hardware products. One of its products is the line follower robot which is an educational toy/game. With this game, while learning algorithmic thinking, you can control your robot by using an interesting yet simple graphical programming language to define the robot’s movement strategy. After implementing your algorithm using your own computer you can download it to the Robot after which the robot will automatically follow your defined strategy (in your algorithm). You can program your robot over and over, test it in action and improve your algorithm based on the feedback you’re getting from the robot’s movement. Remember, your robot can follow any lines!
We believe that Robots will play a more significant role in our future and we will be dealing with them in almost every aspects of our lives. Playing with robots is one of the very important things for kids and students. Therefore, we are planning to introduce a new toy to the market which will be known as an educational game for children/students. This way, children and students, while playing, will be encouraged to learn robotics and acquire problem solving skills. Our goal is to create a competitive and exciting atmosphere in which education occurs subconsciously.The Robot’s technical details as well as its applications are shown in the following video and images. This robot has been completely designed and implemented. We are currently at the stage of building its body in order to make it look like a toy. This robot has been pre-programmed to follow different types of lines. The students/children can also come up with their own creative ideas and easily implement them using the robot’s graphical programming software. The final product will look like the sample provided in the image below (Product Catalog) and will be marketed as an educational toy for children/students.1.Manufacturing process, from the beginning till now:All the electrical parts, mechanical and software of this product have been designed and built by ourselves. Each of the above-mentioned parts, along with their corresponding images are briefly described in the below. It is worthwhile to mention that this product is currently used in robotic labs for educational purposes. However, by changing its appearance into a toy, we are planning to produce it in bulk, as a smart educational toy and introduce it to the market.-> Circuit design and central controller including:-> Mechanical part of the robot including:-> Programming Software (CD)The program will be implemented in a graphical software and then will be uploaded to the robot via a USB cable.The software includes the following parts:    Graphical programming environment to define new strategies for the robot on how to follow the lines
    2D Simulation
    3D Simulation.-> Packaging:The current educational packaging will be replaced with a packaging suitable for toys (based on the market needs)2.  Manufacturing process, moving forward:-> Finishing the design and implementation of the exterior frame (3 months)-> Final functional test of the robot in different situations (1 month)-> Preparing the production line in the capacity of 20,000 pieces per month – 1st phase (2 months)-> Production kick-off and start sending backers’ rewards.The estimate time of sending rewards to the backers is 6 months from now and the guaranteed time of sending rewards to the backers is one year from now.Even though robotic is a complex science we have tried to simplify this product so even the children can play with it.",Abdolkarim Dabbagh,CA$ 160,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Thu, May 7 2015 3:40 AM UTC +00:00",Build your own smart Robot; Program your robot using its specific graphical software; Start playing and competing with others.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,1, ,0,"CA$ 100,000",Educational Robot by Abdolkarim Dabbagh — Kickstarter
133,"This robotic arm is being used at Tarleton State University for kinematics research.  It has 45 cm of reach, is powered by a 20 volt Porter Cable battery, and is operated from an Android device via a BlueTooth connection. It has 8 degrees of freedom and is constructed from FeeTech SCS115 servos. It is basically a fun power tool you can run from your phone. 

Several prototypes have been made with body structures 3d printed from ABS and PLA plastic. The shipped units will be 3d printed from a carbon fiber filament. This is a very durable unit and is surprisingly powerful. 

We would like to get the arm out to the world of roboticists for feedback. Future versions will use the Nvidia Jetson modules to process camera data and work autonomously. The software is available on the GitHub and we will continue to update.

134,"Introducing eMotion, a moving, robotic device that holds your iPad or Android tablet. Use a phone, tablet or PC to video chat (like Skype or Facetime) over the Internet with the tablet your eMotion robot is holding. During your video chat, you remotely control the movements of the robot to have it go wherever you please. This is called telepresence. It's awesome and it's going to change the way you think of video chat!eMotion is the world's first professional grade, telepresence robot that is extremely affordable. Use it for work or use it for fun! eMotion gives your tablet wheels to take your video chat / conferencing in exciting and fun new directions! No more static conversations looking at wherever the camera happens to be pointing. eMotion puts you in the driver's seat for limitless new video chat scenarios.eMotion is ready to use right out of the box for work or play. Beautifully crafted with quality components and attractive finishes, eMotion fits perfectly in any home or office decor. With the click of a button, you instantly connect to your eMotion robot from across town or around the world.The possible uses for eMotion are endless:It's all up to your imagination!!We've been fascinated by all the possibilities of telepresence but the devices available are very expensive ($2000 - $3000). Video chat with full movement control allows for a limitless number of new scenarios not possible with static video chat. We love the idea of being able to monitor our homes when we're away but the available stationary camera products are relatively expensive and are stuck on the shelf you place them on, viewing just what's directly in front of them. We wanted a professional style telepresence device that could do real work but was cheap enough that we could buy one just for fun. We realized a lot of other people would want one too if we could produce it in quantity and achieve a very low price point.The iPad and Android tablets we all use are Internet connected computers capable of capturing and playing video. Most people upgrade fairly frequently leaving them with older tablets that typically sit on a shelf gathering dust. The price of a new, basic tablet is also quite affordable. eMotion puts your current or older tablet to work in amazing new ways. eMotion was designed for 10"" tablets but also holds tablets down to 7"". The following tablet configurations are supported for use on your eMotion robot:You can control the robot from another Android or iOS, phone or tablet or from your PC through a Chrome web browser. The following devices can be used to connect to your eMotion robot:Just download the free iOS or Android app to your tablet, mount it securely on the robot and you're ready to go! If you're using an iOS or Android phone or tablet to connect with your eMotion robot, just use the same app on this device as well. If you're using a PC running Chrome, just have the latest version of Chrome installed on your PC. The following are screenshots of various devices running the eMotion app while controlling an iPad mounted on the eMotion robot:Your connection will be arranged automatically through our free and secure cloud service. All video connections are carried out directly and privately between your devices.Note: Production unit will have larger wheels and rollers for superior movement across flooring and transitions.The robot is powered by a battery box that holds AA alkaline batteries. This provides the 5V power required to run the Bluetooth controller and motor drivers. Using standard batteries avoids costly import and shipping restrictions which keeps our costs down and reduces shipping delays. You can use your own rechargeable AA batteries if desired. To increase standby times for the robot and/or tablet, commonly available and inexpensive USB power units can be easily added by the user and housed neatly in the rear compartment. The center column has a channel for conveniently hiding any cable used to provide additional power to the tablet. Want to extend your eMotion robot to do your own things? We've got you covered. The free eMotion SDK will allow you to write your own iOS and Android apps that control eMotion's motors via Bluetooth. Simply use the sample Bluetooth control code from our SDK to quickly get your app running your robot. Your tablet is already packed with multiple sensors you can make use of.In addition, we will open source the Bluetooth and motor controller hardware to any interested backers who want to better understand and/or customize their robot. We've also left plenty of room in the rear compartment in case you want to add your own hardware (e.g. additional sensors) and keep it out of sight. The eMotion aluminum column is designed for easy mounting of your own accessories at any height you need. The column also has a channel for conveniently hiding any wiring you add to keep things tidy.Firstly, we are happy to supply the Kickstarter production units directly to backers at cost in order to ready the product for later retail sale. Kickstarter is about covering our production costs to make this project a reality; it's not about making a profit from backers.Secondly, we are keeping our costs as low as possible. At every point in the eMotion design process, our extended team has used their broad industry experience to ensure quality components and design never translates into parts or processes which are expensive to manufacture. By making the right choices, having the right partnerships already in place and moving to mass production, we are able to pass the savings onto all our backers!As you can see, this project is very real, ready for production and has endless possibilities! Please back us now and help us reach our goal to deliver eMotion to the world. As soon as we meet our goal, we will give the green light to begin manufacturing so we can quickly deliver eMotion to all our backers.Thank you! We can't wait to see what you do with your eMotion robot!

I have no issue doing some assembly if required to cut this cost to $25.~  Next - how well does it handle ""shifts"" or ""edges"" between rooms - like if I have a small piece of curved wood at the bottom of the door frame? Or transitioning from wood to tile? Do the wheels slip? Is there an opportunity to attach more rugged wheels so it could also go outside?~  Next - height adjust - is there an opportunity to get a shorter one (for example, if I don't need to be 5 ft tall when I'm on telepresence) or adjust the height?~  Next - any thought to attachments (like, a simple pincer on an actuated arm that can, for example, turn off the stove, or press a simple button or turn off a light switch or surge protector) or ideas how we could do it ourselves (to keep the costs down?)~  Next - What happens when it runs out of power? What indicators show the power levels to remote or local users? How long will it go being continuously moved until it runs out of power (or is this a function of material being traversed, due to different power consumption based on how hard the motors have to work to move it? If so, ""wood floor"" and ""industrial carpet"" are the ones I'm most interested in)~  Just want to confirm there's no tilt for the tablet stand available - correct? Stretch goal?~  Great idea!~  How does this one compare with Double Robotics?~  Alan~  @creator the robot looks unstable (tippy). can you please show the bottom of the robot and tell me the type of obstacles it can overcome as far as: Different Floor heights, Shag carpet, stairs. is there any way to tilt the ipad by remote ? what does whole robot weigh (with ipad) ? are there any plans to automate its ability to dock and charge itself ? ( including charging the ipad) was thinking self-charging would make it independent of human support. would like to leave it at vacation home for up to 6 months to monitor and perform security functions independently.

transforms the Associated RC12r5 series kit into the first competition 1/12
scale car with a full underbody package. Technology from the most
aerodynamically advanced full scale cars that have conquered Lemans,
Daytona, and the Nurburgring has been scaled down to provide the
best aerodynamic package in the industry.The 2 mm thick chassis has been designed to be as narrow as
possible. This gives the platform the lowest possible
roll inertia and provides the maximum area for downforce producing side pods. A
rear diffuser efficiently evacuates air from under the motor pod and provides
extra rear down force and its ultra light polycarbonate panels close off the
body without adding weight.Each kit includes the carbon fiber chassis pieces, aluminum
motor pod mounts, underbody aerodynamic components and the additional hardware.The Vectorworks Hornet....Control the air…dominate the competitionIt has already provent to be a proven clube racer, as it finished 2nd at its very first outing at NORCAR in 17.5 stock.

Le nom Alta Robotique est choisi au détriment du nom DroneCity pour des projets plus généraux sur la robotique et non uniquement basés sur les drones. L’idée serait de développer des produits robotiques à énergie renouvelable.
 Le nom Dronecity restera pour définir le nom de la communauté suivante de l’entreprise.2- L’étude, la recherche et développement 2015L’année 2015 a été l’année du choix du produit et de la recherche pour l’implémenter. Le produit choisi est un scooter électrique auto équilibré de type segway. L’équipe adjoint un spécialiste mécanique et électronique pour l’accompagner dans la réalisation du prototype notamment le choix des matériaux et des composants électroniques.
Une version initiale est définie. Et un budget est alloué pour la conception du prototype.3- La réalisation du prototype 2016En 2016, l’équipe technique multidisciplinaire en mécanique, electronique et informatique a été mise sur pieds pour réaliser le prototype. L’usinage des pièces, l’achat des composants, la réalisation d’une première maquette se sont succédés. Toutes ces étapes ont abouti à la réalisation d’un prototype physique proche de nos attentes. Le prototype est présenté au grand public en Décembre 2016 lors du lancement avec la communauté Dronecity.
Le prototype physique exclut l’interface de gestion informatique dans un premier temps. Le produit est baptisé “ALTA ONE”.4- La finition et la campagne Kickstarter 2017La finition du produit et le début de la commercialisation a été effectuée en 2017.
En effet le module à énergie solaire et l’écran tactile de gestion informatique ont été configuré pour apporter une valeur ajouté au produit.

139,"G-Away is a handy, quick, and easy solution to clean narrow mouth water bottles or containers. There are two methods to clean water bottles.  1.  Insert a G-Away packet inside bottle and rinse. 2. Insert a G-Away auto powered brush with our unique powder mix. Both can remove algae, stain, and odor from inside bottle or container. Regular use of G-Away can keep your bottle crystal clear. G-Away uses all natural food ingredients and absolutely no chemicals are used, it is safe for health. Most of us don’t have any time to spend in cleaning water bottles and milk bottles. For example everyday we just just rinse our kids school bottles and pack in rush hours, after a while they start smelling. And we can't dish-wash these plastic bottles or even color coated steel bottles. The dish-washer can ruin the bottle or release bottle chemicals inside. Currently in the market there is no known handy method to clean algae/stains/odor from inside a narrow mouth water bottle or container. People tried various methods and techniques to clean the algae using solutions available in market ,but fail to remove it completely. And current market methods are not safe for human due to hazard chemicals used in the  solutions. As they are very toxic and can be harmful if consumed. It is very difficult to clean the bottle with the narrow mouth bottle as we cannot use our hand, nor use any handy tool to insert and clean. But do not worry, we have brought you the safe and easy solution that is G-Away. You just have to drop G-Away sachet inside bottle and rinse or use G-Away device to clean the inside bottle.Inserting G-Away packet Method:          Just insert a G-Away packet inside the water bottle with kitchen paper towel, add some water to dilute the mix and rinse all over the sides for 1 minute. Watch that algae going away. The detailed instructions are on the pouch. And also please refer our project video above. This pouch has 20 packets inside, it can come for 20 rinses.  This kind of rinsing can be done in rush hours to remove stain built-up and odor.Inserting G-Away auto powered brush method:Apart from using G-Away packet, we have electronic devices which can be inserted inside the bottle like a robot and clean it. The dome device can be inserted independently inside the bottle and controlled using remote or it can be attached to a long flexible handle and directed on all sides of the bottle to clean it. The auto powered brush can used for removing hard stains and odor. The following is a dome shaped G-Away agitator device. It comes with a detachable and flexible handle. This can be inserted inside the bottle/container independently or attached with a handle. The brush’s rotation/vibration operation ,and the powder mix diluted with water (released from the device pores), de-log the algae/stains and odor from inside bottle very easily. The rotating brush can be controlled using a remote.In this release, we will have a dome device of the diameter width = 1.75"" (inch) and height = 2.0"" (inch). In the future, we will be making miniature ones as well, so that it can be inserted in any size narrow mouth bottle. The following is a rotating G-Away capsule agitator can be moved to all sides of the bottle. The capsule shaped device is easier in some kinds of bottles/containers especially in kid’s milk bottles and drinking water bottles.The Capsule Device Size will be width = 0.75"", height = 2.5"".My wife owns a water store in Santa Clara, California. Many customers asked us how to clean these narrow mouth water bottles. That triggered an idea for us to think about and research. We found no easy solution in the market to clean any kind of narrow mouth containers. This inspired me to develop smart devices.  I have decided to quit my full time job and fill the gap in the society and help the world.  I have many ideas, visions, and dreams to develop IOT based appliances and applications. This is just beginning. Please support me and together we can change the world. I am very confident that our team will deliver smart products to the people in the world.We have already released the G-Away pouches to the market for manual agitation clean-up. Here is live recording of a consumer cleaning the bottle using the G-Away manual agitation method. You can see how the green algae is being washed away.  The re-usable bottles that we carry every day for sports or work are not clean. There is so much stuff accumulated in the bottles and it's invisible but it can smell bad sometimes. We need to clean them. G-Away can help to clean these narrow mouth bottles easily.Currently our team is working on building the robot device that can be inserted inside the bottle. The device rotates/vibrates inside the bottle to clean the surfaces. The device operation can be controlled using the remote control.The following is our raw experiment pictures that we tried to build a model and test out.Our team has worked on the circuit design and we have lined up the circuit board manufacturer. We have a 3D model designed by professionals and a lined up plastic moulding manufacturer.With the G-Away agitator you can clean flower vases, narrow mouth containers, cups, dishes, and in many more appliances.",AquaLayer Inc.,"$1,859","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Tue, February 3 2015 9:24 PM UTC +00:00","G-Away is a handy, quick, easy and natural solution to clean narrow mouth water bottles/milk bottles or any containers.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,17, ,0,"$45,000",G-Away Bottle Cleaner and Deodorizer -  Robot Agitator Brush by AquaLayer Inc. — Kickstarter
140,"HAL-e makes learning about programming and assembling robots affordable and accessible. Using open-source hardware and software, the kit simplifies basic robotics without taking away the value gained by hands-on-assembly. Additionally, after being built, HAL-e is an effective tool in teaching step-based programming to children.At first, she's merely an Arduino, a chassis, a key pad, motors, wheels, battery pack, and a few screws. However, with our detailed instruction manual and a couple of hours of work, she becomes a robot aimed at children ages 7-13. Robots in educating children tend toward two extremes, either click-and-play toys or hopelessly complicated, requiring an adult with an electrical engineering degree to construct. We want to break that pattern and provide actual learning in the process. HAL-e is simple, with informative instructions that carefully detail not just assembly, but the principles that enable her to work. This straightforward approach to robotics comes from our desire to keep the robot straightforward and understandable for elementary school students.That same simplicity is present in HAL-e even after she's built. The key-pad allows anyone to tell the robot where to go using a sequence of button pushes, which viscerally teaches kids about step-based programming. Anywhere with a level surface and ground level obstructions (think your kitchen floor!) is a maze that HAL-e can be taught to navigate with up to 50 consecutive commands. We want to keep HAL-e accessible, not just in assembly, but also in price. In order to do that, we need funding to buy the motors, wheels, and other components in bulk. We would like to custom print the motor driver, which is only cost effective with great volume. It may seem excessive to get the driver custom made, but it would greatly simplify the construction. Looking ahead, we'd like to expand the HAL-e line with more sensors and accessible computer based programming for children.We're offering a couple options because people have different needs when it comes to robots, depending on where you're using it (school or at home) and what you have access to (laser cutter or a classroom full of kids).

Back in the days of Battlebots, I was on a fighting Robot
Team called Team “Pole Cat” Our robots name was “Spinning Mayhem”. For several
years we went to Treasure Island and also Fort Mason. Battlebots was sold to
Tiger Electronics; there were suddenly no more events. Robo games picked up the
ball and added many categories of Robot classes. I built a robot for
advertising my business. With an athalon 2.4 Gig prosessor and a pair of 19”
monitors. Ad-bot started coming together, a motorized computer on wheels, for a
power point presentation of my Stainless Steel winery Equipment. At the wine
Symposium We would run him up and down the sidewalk in front of the event. He
also won third place at the Robo Games “Best of Show” category.While at these competitions I was amazed by these small
bipedal robots built with radio control servos for each joint. Very cool. I
took hundreds of pictures of these guys doing their Kung Fu on each other, with
knockdowns as a win, not total destruction. Another competition was the
“Tetsugin” or in English “Iron Man” Comp. This event requires a lift in time,
length and weight. With these rules both contestants used compressed air. Air
is faster than other means of actuation. Hydraulics are stronger, but slower.
The other side of this competition was walking. At that time no one could make
them walk. Now with the combination of these two fine examples, I have come up
with a basic frame to support the human form and some heavy hydraulics. About
$50,000.00 I could start to make an EXO suit that can lift 2000#. After seeing
what the universities where making with federal funding I knew that I needed a
different path, so I went small. Assisting those with feeble strength or
missing legs. My creative juices went crazy making linear motors. Playing with
PVC pipe and fittings like leggos I built my first battery powered linear
motor. When I had mounted these on my frame I came to other realizations,
mostly that I would need right angle gearboxes for the knees and hips. More
creative juice and wal-la PVC right angle gearboxes. Thanks to Bob-Cad and a
Vertical machining center, all came together as planed. With one of these built
I realize that gearboxes at all degrees of freedom will make this guy work even
better then my original Idea. One must be able to make changes when they are
right. Now I need to measure my torque at each joint to order proper power and
gear ratios. However I have run out of funds. ",Jack H.

142,"       I am doing this Kickstarter project to assist me with the funds needed to create a prototype personal robot named Home Bot. Home Bot will be a simple but very useful robot to play with around the house. I would plan to sell them for under $500. I think $300 would be a reasonable price if I could build them cheap enough. Home Bot will be able to GRAB A BEER from the fridge via remote control from your phone. You would control it by using an app on your iphone or other I device from anywhere over 4g or a wifi connection. Home Bot would also need to be in a wifi area to receive commands to operate. Android versions would come after success with first gen. You will be able to steer by seeing a live view from your ipad cameras (both front and rear) helping you to see where you are going when operating from afar. It will be able to grab objects with its claw/pincher arm off of the ground or from a counter and place them in a basket for transport around the home. Home Bot should have a large enough battery in its base for hours of play time. There will also be a drive up charging pad for easy charge and storage while not using so it's always ready to go.       Things you could do with Home Bot include grabbing items around the house and bringing them to you while you lie on the couch. Turning on and off lights in your home while away. Use it as a skype or facetime device to check in with family members while away. Check on Fido or your cats through facetime and even play fetch with them or give them a treat while away from the home. Home Bot could assist people with mobile disabilities. Home bot could bring hours of joy to children and adults by grabbing and retrieving different objects from around the house.     My plan is to hopefully receive enough interest and funding for my idea to get it off the ground and build my first prototype. I would do this with the help of some interested partners and app developers. I don't think it would be very difficult to build this robot. I would try to keep moving parts down to a minimum to reduce complexity and breakdowns. Home Bot would not be able to go up or down stairs on its own. My goal would be to keep the price as affordable as possible to reach the most customers. Any left over funds after the prototype is built would go directly into manufacture and marketing.    To me this robot seems like a no brainer. We have seen very complex humanoid robots from car manufacturers like Honda which would be way overpriced for most people. We have affordable drones that take HD video from the air. The best robot for the home presently seems to be a Roomba. Really, a Roomba, is that the best we got in 2015. It seems someone forgot to build a simple and affordable remote control robot to do simple tasks around the home. If you feel like I do and know that now is the time for this cool piece of technology, then please support my Home Bot project and I will try to make this a realty in the near future.  Please contact me if you would be able to provide any ideas, resources, or anything you think that could help me make this a reality. If my first week of funding goes well, I will make a video to share my Home Bot idea.

They served as a fun toy primarily intended for adults due to its cost and fragility. However, be as it may, Sony shutdown the AIBO robotics division and support for them ceased in the mid 2000s. To this day the AIBO robots are functional but have mechanical and battery failures which SONY no longer supports.PrototypingWe successfully created working prototypes. One of the challenges that we've overcome was utilizing our own custom hardware without interrupting the normal functionality of AIBO. We designed and 3D-printed a case that fits the new hardware inside the existing compartment. From there we underwent vigorous tests measuring battery life degradation to ensure we wouldn't run into any existing or new problems with this prototype solution. We were met with great success and are excited to offer this as a viable battery pack solution for AIBO enthusiasts.Sony discontinued support for the AIBO and does not offer replacement parts or battery packs any longer.

147,"This robot kit got its start about 2 years ago as a way to provide a very low cost introduction to robotics.  Although the circuit that brings this little bug to life has been in circulation for many years, at that time, we struggled to find a physical design that was easy to mass produce and assemble.The first iteration was called the Skitter Bot.  It became so popular that we gave it a makeover and kept it as a staple in our robotics classes.  Revision B is now called the BreadBug.  It carries a 170 point breadboard on its back which allows you to change the way it interacts with its environment.  When you assemble it to the default configuration, it will run in collision detection mode avoiding obstacles by ""feeling"" for them with its antennae.  In other words, it uses biomimicry to act like a real bug.The answer to that question is simple…fun! BreadBug is just plain fun to build and to experiment with. You learn best through experimentation. The built-in breadboard allows you to reconfigure it for many different behaviors. You can even plug in a small microcontroller for added functionality. There are many robotics kits out there, but we found that it was hard to get a good quality kit for under $20. Team learning with one kit per 4 to 5 students is okay, but with the BreadBug, students are able to get a one-on-one learning experience that is otherwise hard to get.The BreadBug has been designed so that you can rearranged the wiring on the breadboard which allows the student to experiment with different ""behaviors"" of the BreadBug.  It is also possible to add a variety of sensors and a low power microcontroller to get even more complex activity.  Curriculum is in development to provide step by step instruction on carrying out experiments with the BreadBug.From the very beginning we have worked to develop the BreadBug in a real world environment.  Well, we'll let the following pictures speak for themselves.   Funding this campaign will give us the ability to incorporate the following design changes.By helping to fund this project we be able to buy materials in bulk and thereby lowering the cost of each kit.  By making the kits affordable we can get them into the hands of everyone who would like to learn more about robotics.Spread the Word:Body is laser cut baltic birch.  Runs on 2 AAA batteries.  Overall dimmensions are ""3 x 3"" x 1.75"", not counting antennae.  Everything you need to put it together is included in the kit.  The only tool you need to put it together is a phillips screwdriver which is also included.The kit includes: 
(1) laser cut body plate 
(2) DC motors with thrust bearings and rubber feet 
(1) 3D printed motor mount 
(1) 170 point breadboard 
(2) antennae switches with feelers attached

148,"  ZIRKOOS is an open-source/hardware project that encourages teachers and parents to teach programming and robotics to girls and boys from their earliest stages of education. ZIRKOOS is a small Arduino-compatible robot that can be programmed through a set of buttons that allow you to run a sequence of steering movements. From this, imagination is the only limit to its full potential.ZIRKOOS might looks like other robots, but we can highlight some basic features. Among them, 1. It´s made by you. For your pupils, children, your sons,... Everyone be able to collaborate by participating in the development community from the beginning. The experience of building or modify your own ZIRKOOS becomes something amazing, even more when children are involved in this task.2. It´s a open hardware (OSHW) and free software (FOSS) so you can adapt its characteristics to your needs; to put sensors, LEDs, change the amplitude of the rotation angle, the distance it moves at each step, set sounds,... whatever that comes to your mind.3. It´s very affordable, by price, in comparison to other educational robotic systems taking into account manufacturing costs. The aim is that ZIRKOOS be a low-cost robot, but high quality, which also enables bring robotics and programming to those environments where economic resources are a constraint to the use of this kind of educational tools.  ZIRKOOS is a robot kit specifically designed for young children aged 4-7 years old. It is different from any other kit out there because it appeals to both technically minded kids and those that connect more to arts and culture or physical activity. Young children learn by doing. Children build their own robot with ZIRKOOS, program it to do what they want, and decorate it. ZIRKOOS gives children the chance to make their ideas physical and tangible—exactly what their young minds and bodies need. And ZIRKOOS does all this without requiring screen time from PCs, tablets or smartphones.Designed for open-ended play, ZIRKOOS lets children make many things - a character from a story, a dancer, a race robot - anything that they can think of. The child creates a sequence of instructions (a program) using the color-LED ZIRKOOS buttons. Then, they press the go-button and the robot comes alive. With ZIRKOOS, young children can become programmers, engineers, designers, artists, dancers, choreographers and writers. And unlike other activity kits out there. Coding (or programming) is a new kind of literacy. But it exercises mental muscles that are useful for many other activities and skills. When playing with ZIRKOOS, young children learn programming ideas that are directly related to foundational concepts in math, literacy, science and humanities. These include sequencing, modularity, cause-and-effect, and patterns. Research shows that sequencing is foundational for academic success, for math and literacy development. Furthermore, children engage in habits of mind such as: design process when they iteratively develop and test an idea; problem solving when their ZIRKOOS programs don’t work the way they want; and executive functions when they plan and execute their projects with different kinds of constraints such as time, resources or materials.Young children love to make things, and they love to make things that move and respond to their commands. Robotics brings together atoms and bits - the physical world and computational world. Robotics is a natural fit for young children’s interests and curiosities. Research shows that young children will learn programming and engineering at a very early age if they are given tools that are developmentally appropriate. Research also shows that children are most open to new ways of thinking about themselves when they are under the age of eight. So to ensure that their self-image includes enjoyment, understanding and competence in working with technology, it is best to expose them to it while they are open to soaking it up. That way they will grow up to have skills that give them both improved employment opportunities and a healthy outlet for self-expression.Furthermore, research shows that from an economic and a developmental standpoint, educational programs that begin in early childhood are associated with lower costs and more durable effects than interventions that begin later on. Research also shows that introducing STEM (Science, Technology Engineering and Math) in early childhood might help to avoid stereotypes. However, one of the major impediments for bringing technology and engineering into early childhood education is the lack of developmentally appropriate technologies. ZIRKOOS addresses this need.   ZIRKOOS is designed on a firm understanding of the cognitive, social, emotional and motor abilities and needs of young children. With ZIRKOOS young children can program without a PC screen, tablet or mobile phone, and they can be talked about and debugged in a social circle. Most research-based robotic construction kits are designed for older children. They come out of labs or universities with a focus on engineering and computer science. In contrast, ZIRKOOS was specifically designed for young children. ZIRKOOS is based on over 2 years of work, with the idea of making a suitable robotic system for children.Remember the first turtle of the LOGO programming language back in the 70’s? It was not on the screen- it was a physical robot that would move around the floor. Many years have passed since then, but the vision is still alive. We are lucky that today there are many flavors and choices of different robotic learning environments for children. ZIRKOOS makes its contribution by addressing an audience that was left behind but is particularly important: young children between 4 and 7 years. As we have seen, ZIRKOOS is a small robot developed for small ingenious minds. It is easy to assemble and simple to handle. It is designed so that teachers, parents or coordinators of activities with children, have an educational tool to assist them in implementing their learning objectives. ZIRKOOS has a number of features that make it ideal for developing playful and learning activities.For simplicity, ZIRKOOS is also ideal in numerous learning programs and activities with children with special educational needs. We think ZIRKOOS brings features that allow it to interact with children with special educational needs, or with some physical or mental disjunctions. We believe that educational robotics is already a useful and excellent tool to work with and enhance the cognitive, physical and social skills in children with disabilities.  ZIRKOOS comes with:At DROKOO Robotics, we believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, that’s why our hardware design and code library are open source and available to everyone.We have worked hard to keep both the hardware design and the code library simple, so that anyone can peek under the hood and take a look at exactly how ZIRKOOS is made. Working with open source hardware and code also means that ZIRKOOS can be used and improved by the community at large.Check out our open-source hardware design and code library out on GitHub, after completion of this Kickstarter campaign. We will publish all the project´s documentation.We have developed and tested three different generations of the ZIRKOOS prototypes with children and teachers. After comparing notes and analyzing pros and cons, we decided on a final version. All mechanical and electronic prototype designs are completed. We expect to spend a busy summer to achieve our production goals!There is no doubt that the support can be received on this project is always important and an incentive to continue working and developing new tools and educational models.
ZIRKOOS represents the effort to bring robotics and programming to the minds of children.With this campaign we hope to receive the support of a large community made up of educators, parents, makers, ... and anyone who considers educational robotics as a key element for intellectual and emotional development of children.With your support we intend to improve the prototypes developed in order to present a robotic model best suited for use with children, both inside and outside education. Mainly we need your support to:1. Finish the changes and make some improvements in hardware and software. Check aspects related to electronics and programming for the development of new functions. All ZIRKOOS prototypes are fully functional, but we are making some small changes before launching the final model.2. Design new chassis and study the models developed to achieve the best combination between mechanics and electronics.3. Design educational activities that serve educators to work with children in the classroom.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  ZIRKOOS es un proyecto open-source que estimula a profesores y padres a enseñar programación y robótica a niñas y niños desde sus primeras etapas educativas. ZIRKOOS es un pequeño robot, compatible con Arduino, que puede ser programado mediante una serie de pulsadores que permiten establecer una secuencia de movimientos de dirección. A partir de esto, la imaginación es el único límite a todas sus posibilidades.ZIRKOOS puede parecerse a otros robots, pero podemos indicar algunas características básicas. Entre ellas,1. Está diseñado para ti. Para tus alumnos, niños, hijos,... Todos pueden ser colaboradores participando en la comunidad de desarrollo desde el primer momento. La experiencia de construir o modificar tu propio ZIRKOOS se convierte en algo apasionante, más aún cuando los niños están involucrados en esta tarea.2. Es open hardware y software libre, por lo que puedes adaptar sus características a tus necesidades; añadir sensores, LEDs, cambiar la amplitud del ángulo de rotación de las ruedas, la distancia que se mueve en cada paso, incorporar sonidos,... lo que se te pase por tu mente.3. Es muy asequible en precio, en comparación con otros sistemas robóticos educativos, teniendo en cuenta los costes de fabricación. El objetivo es que ZIRKOOS sea un robot de bajo coste, pero de gran calidad, que permita acercar la robótica y la programación a aquellos ámbitos, donde por razones económicas se restringe el uso de esta clase de herramientas educativas. ZIRKOOS es un kit robótico especialmente diseñado para niños entre 4-7 años. Es diferente a cualquier otro kit existente ya que atrae tanto a los niños con una mentalidad más técnica, como a los que conectan más con actividades artísticas, culturales o físicas. Los niños pequeños aprenden experimentando. Construyen su propio robot con ZIRKOOS, lo programan para que haga lo que quieran, e incluso lo decoran. ZIRKOOS da a los niños la oportunidad de que sus ideas sean tangibles, justo lo que sus pequeñas mentes y cuerpos necesitan. Y ZIRKOOS hace todo esto sin que los niños requieran pasar tiempo frente a la pantalla de un ordenador, tablet o smartphone.Diseñado para un juego y aprendizaje ilimitado, ZIRKOOS permite a los niños hacer muchas cosas -un personaje para una historia, un baile, una carrera de robots- cualquier cosa que puedan imaginar. Los niños crean una secuencia de instrucciones (un programa) usando los pulsadores de colores LED de ZIRKOOS. A continuación, presionan el pulsador de inicio y el robot cobra vida. Con ZIRKOOS, los niños pueden convertirse en programadores, ingenieros, diseñadores, artistas, bailarines, coreógrafos o escritores; tal vez de manera muy distinta a otras actividades que puedan realizar.  La programación es un nuevo tipo de alfabetización. Ejercita músculos mentales que son útiles para muchas otras actividades y habilidades. Cuando se trabaja con ZIRKOOS, los niños aprenden a programar ideas que están directamente relacionadas con conceptos fundamentales de matemáticas, literatura, ciencia y humanidades. Estos incluyen además, la secuenciación, la modularidad, la relación causa-efecto, así como las pautas de aprendizaje. Las investigaciones muestran que la secuenciación es fundamental para el éxito académico, así como para el desarrollo matemático y lector. Por otra parte, los niños son capaces de abordar retos mentales, tales como; el diseño de procesos, cuando de forma iterativa desarrollan y prueban una idea; la resolución de problemas, cuando sus programas con ZIRKOOS no funcionan de la manera que desean; y las funciones ejecutivas, cuando planifican y ejecutan sus proyectos con diferentes tipos de restricciones tales como el tiempo y los recursos o materiales.A los niños les encanta crear cosas, y más aún cuando hacen cosas que se mueven y responde a sus órdenes. La robótica permite combinar átomos y bits -el mundo físico con el mundo computacional. La robótica es la pieza clave que se ajusta a los intereses y curiosidades de los niños. Las investigaciones muestran que los niños pequeños pueden aprender conceptos de programación e ingeniería a edades muy tempranas, si ellos disponen de herramientas desarrolladas específicamente.Las investigaciones también indican que los niños están más abiertos a nuevas formas de pensamiento sobre sí mismos cuando están bajo la edad de ocho años. Así, para asegurar que su auto-imagen incluye el disfrute, el conocimiento y la competencia en el trabajo con la tecnología, lo mejor es exponerlos a ella mientras estén receptivos a su aprendizaje. De esta manera, crecerán desarrollando habilidades que les posibiliten mejores oportunidades profesionales y una forma saludable para expresarse a sí mismos. Por otra parte, las investigaciones expresan que desde un punto de vista económico y de desarrollo, los programas educativos que comienzan en los primeros años de la infancia, se asocian con
menores costos y efectos más duraderos que las intervenciones que comienzan más tarde. Así mismo, la introducción de programas STEM (Ciencia, Tecnología, Ingeniería y Matemáticas) en la primera infancia, pueden ayudar a evitar ciertos estereotipos. Sin embargo, uno de los principales impedimentos para unir tecnología e ingeniería en la educación infantil es la falta de tecnologías apropiadas para su puesta en marcha. ZIRKOOS responde a esta necesidad.  ZIRKOOS esta diseñado sobre el firme conocimiento de las necesidades y de las habilidades cognitivas, sociales, emocionales y motoras de los niños. Con ZIRKOOS, los niños pueden programar sin necesitar la pantalla de un ordenador, tablet o teléfono móvil; y pueden comentar y depurar sus programas en sus asambleas o círculos sociales.La mayor parte de los kits de construcción robótica derivados de ciertas investigaciones están diseñados para niños mayores, en etapas avanzadas de aprendizaje. Generalmente provienen de laboratorios o Universidades con un enfoque hacia la ingeniería y las ciencias computacionales. ZIRKOOS está basado en dos años de trabajo y pruebas con profesores y alumnos, con la idea de desarrollar un sistema robótico adecuado para niños.                ¿Recuerdas el primer robot programado en lenguaje LOGO, allá por los años 70? Era un robot que podía moverse por el suelo. Han pasado muchos años desde entonces, pero la visión está todavía viva. Tenemos la suerte de que hoy en día hay muchas opciones de diferentes entornos de aprendizaje robótico para niños. ZIRKOOS hace su contribución al abordar a un público que se quedó atrás, pero que es particularmente importante; los niños pequeños entre 4 y 7 años.Como ya hemos visto, ZIRKOOS es un pequeño robot desarrollado para pequeñas mentes ingeniosas. Es fácil de ensamblar y simple de manejar. Está diseñado para que los profesores, padres o coordinadores de actividades con niños, tengan una herramienta educativa que les ayude en la implementación de sus objetivos de aprendizaje. ZIRKOOS tiene una serie de características que lo hacen ideal para desarrollar actividades lúdicas y de aprendizaje. Por su simplicidad, ZIRKOOS es adecuado en numerosos programas de aprendizaje y actividades con niños con necesidades educativas especiales. Pensamos que ZIRKOOS reúne características que le permiten interactuar con niños con necesidades educativas especiales, o con algunas disyunciones físicas o psíquicas. Consideramos que la robótica educativa es ya una herramienta útil y excelente para trabajar y motivar las habilidades cognitivas, físicas y sociales de niños con discapacidad.  ZIRKOOS está compuesto por:En DROKOO Robotics creemos que la tecnología debería ser accesible para todos. Por esta razón, todos nuestros diseños de hardware y nuestro código de programación son open-source y disponibles para todo el mundo.Estamos trabajando para mantener los diseños y las librerías de código tan simples como sea posible, para que todos puedan indagar y echar un vistazo para saber como ZIRKOOS funciona exactamente.Visita nuestra cuenta de GitHub tras la finalización de esta campaña, iremos publicando, completando y actualizando todos los archivos open-source del proyecto. Hemos ido desarrollado y trabajado con diferentes generaciones de prototipos de ZIRKOOS, tanto con profesores como con alumnos. Después de verificar notas y analizar pros y contras, creemos que la versión que se desarrollará con esta campaña, cumplirá de la mejor forma las necesidades de aprendizaje dentro del aula. Todos los diseños relativos al desarrollo mecánico y electrónico están completos. ¡Esperamos pasar un verano muy ocupado para conseguir nuestros objetivos de producción!No hay duda de que el apoyo que podamos recibir en este proyecto es siempre importante y un incentivo para continuar trabajando y desarrollando nuevas herramientas y modelos educativos. ZIRKOOS representa el esfuerzo por acercar la robótica y la programación a las mentes de los niños. Con esta campaña esperamos recibir el apoyo de una gran comunidad formada por educadores, padres, makers,... y cualquier persona que considere la robótica educativa como un elemento clave para el desarrollo intelectual y emocional de los niños.
Con tu apoyo tenemos la intención de mejorar los prototipos desarrollados con el fin de presentar un modelo robótico lo más adecuado para su uso con niños, tanto dentro como fuera del ámbito educativo. Principalmente necesitamos tu apoyo para:1. Finalizar cambios y hacer mejoras en hardware y software. Comprobar aspectos relacionados con la electrónica y la programación para el desarrollo de nuevas funciones. Todos los prototipos ZIRKOOS son completamente funcionales, pero estamos haciendo algunos pequeños cambios antes de lanzar el modelo final. 2. Diseño de nuevo chasis y estudio de los modelos desarrollados para lograr la mejor combinación entre mecánica y electrónica. 3. Diseñar y desarrollar actividades con ZIRKOOS, que sirven a los educadores para trabajar con los niños en el aula.  ----------",DROKOO Robotics,€516,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Tue, July 26 2016 6:02 AM UTC +00:00",ZIRKOOS encourages teachers and parents to teach programming and robotics to girls and boys from their earliest stages of education.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,12, ,0,"€6,000",ZIRKOOS - Learning with Robots by DROKOO Robotics — Kickstarter

In these developmentally appropriate courses, participants will build mobile robots that may navigate a variety of problem solving obstacles, intended to find social-justice-based solutions.  Participants will first conduct a community needs assessment in order to determine factors that may interfere with the upward mobility of a community. This may be as simple as, ""the sidewalks on my walk to school are really broken so we sometimes have to walk in the street, which is unsafe"".  Participants are then guided to explore how this problem is ultimately a social issue.  Prompting questions may be, ""why are sidewalks in certain areas of Chicago in disrepair, and others are not?"" or ""how can we make sure all sidewalks in Chicago are repaired?""  Other example topics may include transportation, environment, nutrition, recreation, housing, and sustainable infrastructure, Then the planning, coding and building begins!  Our young engineers will brainstorm the ways in which robotics may be used to find asset-based solutions. By moving participants through an actual engineering project, students may quickly understand the relevance of what they are learning both technically and socially. The curriculum is created to ensure participants with varying learning styles and cognitive abilities can accomplish the lesson goals.Not only do our youth have mechanical minds and love to build. but without a doubt STEAM are paths to successful careers and bright futures.  Of equal importance, this program will encourage the critical thinking skills of our youngest learners.        The ""To the Moon"" Art and Cultural Education program has been able to sustain innovative programming on a $0 budget.

150,"New Atlas: ""We've featured a fair number of underwater drones over the past few years, and they're pretty much all remotely-controlled by their shore-based users. Denmark's Supportive Robotics, however, is developing one that's a bit different. Known as Allec, it can be piloted via remote control, but it can also perform its own autonomous missions.""Read the full article here: dronebelow: 
 Most drones we know are controlled by their owners from a relatively safe surrounding. An underwater drone would be remote controlled by users from the shore or from a ship/vessel on the water. However, Allec, the new submarine drone being developed by Supportive Robotics, Denmark is rather unique. Allec can be remote controlled, but can also perform autonomous missions.While this looks fun for now, the uses of Allec could be limitless in the real world, given its inherent flexibility.Read the full article here: If you are like us, you simply can't help looking at every pool of water you pass by, wondering what's below.Allec is all about allowing you to explore lakes, ponds, the sea, water tanks, your aquarium... Allec does it all.What makes Allec special is that he is a real robot, allowing him to do various missions on his own. You just need to tell him what to do and then sent him on the job. Need to check an lake before swimming or fishing? Just want to see the sights below? Allec is the partner to bring along.And no worries, you can control him directly through a wire and wireless too.What really excites us about Allec is that he allows us to explore the water in the way WE want, intensively wire controlling him one day, laid back letting him do the exploring on another day, while we relax above water, following us on a swim or dive on yet another day.Here in Denmark its cold in the winter and going diving even with the proper gear is a chilly experience. Allec allows us to still explore, while being securily placed above water with a hot cup of cocao. Autonomous, App or PC controllerAllec is a true robot, so he can sail completely on his own:He can be controlled by the app interface (here the Android proto version)And the PC user interface:One of the main features of Allec is his camera. A nice 1080p camera.When sailing without wires Allec will store everything he sees on an internal storage flash card. He has 32 Gb available.On the other hand, if sailing wired, connected to the Wifi bouy, Allec will stream the video directly to the sailing app/pc. Allowing you to se what happens is of course very important, but since Allec can travel completely on his own, he needs the camera to see too.Allec does not just record the world around him, he actually sees it and can categorize the sights into categories.This is probably one of the most exciting parts of Allec, since it allows him  both to avoid obstacles and also to actively search for things.To be able to do this, Allec's brain contain his own version of computer vision.Allec is able to categorize what he sees into 10 categories, rating the likeliness of what he saw with at 0 to 100 % likeliness, for each category.The categories as of now are:
Sea weed, Wreck, Diver, Fish, Jellyfish, Open water, Swimmer, Allec, Fishing net, Sea bed. And yes, you can actually teach him other categories.He will pass that information on to the AI system, that can then act in an appropriate manner.Below a short example of sailing with our Vision test interface enabled. Notice the recognition of Sea bed and to a lesser degree Sea weed.Allec comes equipped with two Power LED lights.They can be controlled through the wire, with an on/off switch.When sailing on his own Allec can control them too. To preserve power he will only switch them on if the light level falls below a certain thresshold.A real robot can of course be programmed. For those who just want to start exploring, not caring about how to program, a number of predefined missions are available. A mission is an overall task you can assign Allec, like scounting an area, leading you to the coordinates of a shipwreck, looking for the nearest fish. A mission can be started directly by pressing Allec's mission selector eye, but you of course can also start him through the app or pc user interface. 
 
  Allec on a missionNow for those who really want to in depth program Allec a full AI programming interface and language is available. It's pretty much a simpified C version, with submarine robot specific commands added. 

In the AI programming language you can create missions. Yes, missions are in fact AI programs, so you can create new ones or change the predefined missions.    A very nice feature of Allec is his Discovery chart. It’s a graphical overview of what Allec experienced during his trip under water and will display the route sailed and the objects Allec recognized during the dive on an area map. Likewise, if you bring Allec along on your underwater diving or snorkeling trip, he will also record and map everything. He can then create a “map” of objects spotted and the route taken, creating a beautiful memory to save or share with your friends.Underwater-enthusiasts can share and compare different areas for diving and snorkeling, and by doing so, help other divers find the beautiful sceneries they have discovered.It can also be used to show friend and family, the beautiful landscapes and fish you have visited, and give them a true experience of the underwater worlds.Wonder how Allec navigate below the waves?The first thing you need to know when considering submarine navigation is that radio waves really don't like to travel below water. The means that when sailing below using GPS for navigation is not possible.We have to fall back to the good old days, where navigation was done using a approximation techique based on reading the ship's compas, measuring the speed traveled and noting how much time went by on each direction, speed pair. Then use the speed - direction for a certain time periode to calculate how far the ship has travelled. Use the new position as start point for the next speed - drection, time set and so on. This technique is called Dead Reckoning.So how does Allec obtain the needed readings?He actually uses a compas, but more than that, he uses a combined acceleratiometer, magnetometer (a 3d compas) and gyroscope. Measurements from these three can be combined to get both yaw, roll and pitch angles or converted into his direction. This combination gives a very good approcimation of the actualy direction travelled.Next then is depth. The good thing about depth is that it can be measured directly using a pressure sensor.Off then to figuring out speed. Allec uses a flow meter to figure out how much water is being pushed by him or more precisely, how much water is being pushed through the flow meter. This measurement can be used to get a good guess of the speed travelled. For those who don't know, a flow meter is basically a very small propeller that rotates several thousand times for each liter that passes by it. To measure flow and thereby speed, the number of rotations is simply measured.Allec does have a few more tricks in regards to speed up his fin sleeve. But a man is allowed a few secrets isn't he.Is Dead Reckoning perfect? Not always, but it is the best you can reasonable get with no absolute fix points to use for positioning.The underwater world is a big place and sometimes it is more fun or efficient to bring friends.Allec can work together with other Allecs to solve missions.Say you want to quickly find places with wrecks or every fish you can possibly spot. Simply put several Allecs on the task.The basic pack functionality is through missions where you can tell how many friends are going to help and also assign a number to each Allec. Based on this the mission can then divide the work. The information is available in the AI programming too, so you can create pack functionality yourself too.While swimming around Allec is able to spot other Allecs, which can be used in the AI programming, allowing you to create more advanced pack functionality.How does magnetically coupled propellers work and why is that a big deal?One of the very first thoughts in the Allec project was that we wanted to make a submarine that would require as little maintenance as possible, meaning that things like cleaning the drive shaft or greasing it, was really not something we wanted to do.So to avoid that task, we decided to totally avoid the drive shaft, with the added bonus that with no drive shaft opening, the water would have no way into the motor.Allec is very proud of his fins and they do stabilize him a when swimming fast.To be able to carry external equipment, that cannot fit within the open hull, the fins can be removed, making available two mounting points.Examples could be IR camera, rear mounted camera, extra LED lights...Below are some fun examples of what they also might be used for.:Water Bottle holders for your diving trip? Maybe even program Allec to go home to fetch more?Robotic grabbers anyone (They are just for show, for now)?Want Allec to control a robotic arm, extra external lights, Reverse mounted camera, measure temperature, get GPS coordinates (when above water), release depth charges...?What you want is the Electronic Expansion Slot.The Electronic Expansion Slot is Allec's way of being able to adapt to your needs.It's basically an adapter that presents various electronic interfaces, that allows the equipment to transfer data to Allec or receive commands from Allec.New items probably require very specific interfacing, so to support this, Allec's AI programming language will be expanded with new commands, directed at controlling whatever new item is being enabled. So yes, you can modify Missions (or write new) to include control of the new items.For those who want's to know the highly technical details, the hardware interfaces made available are:
One I2C, One RS485 serial, One SPI, One ADC (Analog to digital converter)  and a few digital ports (input/output)A WIFI buoy can give a Underwater Drone/ROV a bit of extra freedom and since Allec can function as one, he has one too. The buoy creates a standard 100 feet range network.To keep things simple the WIFI bouy uses the same battery packs that Allec himself uses. In this way you only have to bother with one charger. Also, a WIFI router actually uses quite a bit of power, so a good sized battery pack will ensure you don't run out of power.The WIFI Buoy really has three uses:So Allec comes equipped with batteries that allows him to sail for 90+ minutes. Why bother with having the batteries external and exchangeable?Well, don't you all know the feeling, when playing around with a flying drone, helicopter, plane: The flying is just getting fun and then the batteries run out. A underwater ROV usually runs longer than a plane on the batteries, but still, why spoil a fun moment, when you can just swap the batteries and go on having fun.Designing Allec we wanted to achieve several things:Much of the functionalty and ease of use has already been talked about, so no more about that here.So then onto the looks of Allec.A thing that came up early in our brainstorming sessions was that since Allec would be ""living"" in the waters, it would be natural if he had a shape like something from the sea. That lead to quite a lot of design sketches based on fishes and other sea animals. We ended up with a body shape much inspired by a Whale Shark, though much smaller :)That decided the shape of the hull was much given. To keep with the shape, the motor pods had to be inside the hull. This then presented the problem of getting enough water to the propellers, to generate proper trust. The aft water intakes and the side ""gill"" slots was the result of that.The ""gill"" slots was a nice decision, since it made it clear how to place the exchangeable battery packs and any weights to level out boyancy too.Another feature of the ""gill"" slots is allow placement of smaller external equipment inside Allec. Possible linked to the External Electronic Slot, that is located inside Allec.A fish has eyes, right? So does Allec. Instead of just making them cosmetically we gave them functionality too. One is the main power on/off switch, while the other is mission selector.The top fin (Dorsal) was another decision made base on wanting to keep with the Whale Shark shape, while at the same time solving a technical problem. The functional reason for the top fin is to have a hole hiding the wire/tether connector. We initially hoped to be able to use a gold coated standard RJ45 connector, without any insulation. It works very nice in fresh water, but in salty water too much stray electrical currents would happen, to degrade the wire signals. So instead of just being able to Click the wire onto Allec, an insulated connector that needs to be clicked on and then turned, is the result.Regarding the side fin (Pelvic), a fish really needs to have fins, was our though. They simply makes him look complete. Since we wanted Allec to be easy to transport in a backpack, they needed to be removable. This then led to having two holes available. Why not use them for mounting external equipment? Either mounted through a boom like carrying thingie (see robotics grabbers and beverage holders) or using a small net to hook up in the holes. This was very much in line with our design wish of making sure that Allec would look good: We could give the option of mounting bigger external equipment, while not having to have permanent rails externally.Another effect of placing the motors inside the hull, while keeping Allec small, is that one big lifting body is not possible, it needed to be divided into a front and a aft lifting body. This does increase the complexity of the Plastic Injection Forms, but we really didn't want to compromise on the perfect mix og functionality and design, that is Allec. Hope you agree :)The colors of Allec went through a lot of iterations too. We ended up going with the advice of a biologist asked, using a fish colored grey/silver skin, to make Allec seem like a natural part of his habitate. Based on dives with fishes coming to greet Allec, it seems like the choice was very good (see an example in the Prototype Gallery). And he looks nice too. The Anodized Red (Iron Man) Allec would though have been sooo cool :DFor the hull and other parts of Allec we needed a very strong and water resistant material, with a not too high density. 

 The obvious choice for us was Plastic, though we did consider Aluminium too. Aluminium is too heavy though.Then Plastic was the choice. But plastic is really a very broad definition of a lot of materials with very different properties. Researching a lot of plastics for just the right properties, Yield strength, Young's modulus, water absorbance and density some of the primary, we spend quite some time looking for the right kind of plastic.Let's just say that our prototype supplier and working partner came totally thorugh for us, introducting us for an enhanced ABS plastic that simply blows the charts in regards to all of our needs (our charts at least :) )Finishing off the tech and design talks, here then an animated view of most parts described above. All this tech talk really makes you wan't to see some scenic Allec moments, right? Here you go then.   The Visual fishfinder - The big catch for those who know:There be treasure: The current state of Allec is a functional prototype.  We have a robot that can travel the waters solo or being guided by wire, filming and documenting while he go.  We have working app and pc prototypes, that while functional certainly can use ""a bit of polish"". We have started rewriting them already.  Allec's computer vision is based on showing him large numbers of pictures. The computer vision improves with every dive, due to them giving os even more pictures to train on. To balance the training, we do need pictures from non danish waters too. Bascially we are ready to take the next big and final step towards a real product:  Getting Allec setup for real production. The work for turning the 3D printed CAD models into Plastic Injection Moulding friendly has been done. We though will be using some time to verify each of the forms (there are 13), before actually pressing the production button. Big changes cannot be made to moulds when created and since they are pretty expensive, the extra verification is critical. Preparation for Print Board construction is very far due to the fact that the print boards has been done the ""real"" professional way since version 1. So this is mostly just another iteration. Then we have mechanical assembly, where we have shared descriptions and assembly animation videos with our supplier. To be quite frank, some things requiring corrections in the way to assemble, just might show up. Same goes for testing. The tests are described, but need for improvements might surface. Summed up, the preparations for physical production has been done, but we WILL take our time to verify every step before starting up. Improvements stil can and probably will be made, but we will be very careful not to introduce errors.  In regards to pc and app and Allec firmware, what remains is all about polish, performance improvements and better usability. 
Our biggest funding challenge by far is the costs of the Plastic Injection Moulding Forms. Getting started with those really requires some cash and this is where most of our startup cost is placed. We really need your help for getting the forms.The other equally important reason for asking your help is about actually delivering the best possible product. We have used a LOT of time thinking up, designing and creating Allec in prototype, but now we very much would like your input in how you like him and what might be improved. By pledging you tell us that Allec MUST be created and then following up by giving us your feedback you tell us how he really SHOULD be created.  A few words about how we handle VAT and custom fees.Being a EU based company we are by law required to charge VAT for european customers and since we expect to be using a fullfillment company, we are in EU going to handle the customs fees too. For the rest of the world we must not charge VAT, meaning that any VAT that might apply in your country will be due at delivery. Same goes for Customs fees.Allec resting after some exploration and a lot of information :) Every Startup needs a group of trusted friends to help keep the spirit up, shoot down the really crazy ideas, help with smaller and bigger things. We have been lucky to have a lot of support. :)Two persons deserve special mention. A lot of thanks to both of them:  Rune the son of Thomas has been a very frequent diving partner during tests and filming.  JOY – In our way of doing business, we would like to spread out happiness and positivity by producing products for your daily life, leisure time and make your life more joyful.

intelligence. Allowing the data it perceives to control its actions
and not the randomizing factors of its coding. At its core a
customized architecture will maintain this paradigm. A related
Kickstart project is currently available for funding that also uses
part of this design. It can be found here.
Depending on the funding raised for both of these projects will
impact the robotics phase of this project. The robotics construction
is the most expensive part of the project and will either be a full
copy of the human form or partial depending on funding.
The influencing factors for the prototype will be limited to
sight, hearing and touch. How these inputs will be used and stored
along with development logic will be centered around a custom
computerized modification. The basic principle of operation is custom
micro programs. Every command executed no matter what it may be will
be of fixed length. Every micro program will be the same size as the
largest available on the machine. This will allow a execution
constant to be determined no matter what command is being ran.
Utilization will occur when a block of code is ready to be run. A
counter will determine how many commands are in the block and know
how long it will take to run. With this concept a larger scheme of
holding the overall executions on the machine to a finite time limit
constant will be used with coexisting execution components. This will
allow if possible for extra code to be paired with the block to fill
the time limit. The choice of what fills a gap will have a backbone
or the lack there of to ensure it coincides with the definition of
intelligence. Multiple processors will be used to ensure all
computations are completed and stored by the next time limited cycle.
The command counter will control the proficiency  and sacrifice of
code sections in the time limit. No matter where the code derived
from it will be delegated to other processors and may return to the
original processor in the next time limited cycle.
Encompassing this architecture will be the inflow of sensory data
and saved experiences that can be form new connections. How
experience is stored, analyzed and marked as related material will be
loosely coded and force the machine to manipulate these areas at its
on free will to a evolved perfection. The basic instincts will also
be loosely coded to influence these new connections, including parent
identification, pain and the need to recharge. Upon start up portions
of sensory data will loop into the first cycle and concatenate on.  A
hands on approach of training the machine will be applied and slowly
reduced as it learns.

154,"    OMOROBOT is a small venture company established in 2015 and have a team of highly motivated robotics engineers and designers.Engineers at OMOROBOT have many experiences from industrial robots to self-driving cars. While tackling various robotic problems, we start thinking about how to make robots more useful and affordable to people. DonkiBot is one viable solution. DonkiBot was created in 2015 at a small lab in OMOROBOT, an innovative robotics venture. DonkiBot, as its name stands for, is a donkey like robot that can help people move objects. 
Just like real donkeys, Donkibot can carry more than 100kg (220 lbs.) and follow someone wherever they go. Of course, unlike real donkeys, you do not have to feed or worry about behavioral issues.   Here are some use cases of our DonkiBot. Kids love moving stuffs with DonkiBot. Going to camping? No problem! How does it work? Let's think about how to make a robot that can follow a person. Professional engineers probably have many solutions to solve this kind of problem.  Computer vision detection algorithms can be one of the possible solutions. However, it works perfectly on clear sunny days but may not work as expected at night or in dark areas.
 

Laser or light detection sensor (aka LADRA or LIDAR) works day and night as they actively send light sources to measure the distance from the object. But a LIDAR sensor can cost about the same or even more than the project we are trying to make.

So engineers at OMOROBOT have begun to think about technology that works without using sophisticated sensors and more intuitive ways of interfaces. 

Modes of operationDonkiBot has two different modes of operation: following mode and remote control mode.Following mode is the basic and simplest way of using DonkiBot.
First, drag the tethered sensor which will start to measure distance and direction from you relative to DonkiBot.Once the tethered controller reaches a certain distance from DonkiBot, the robot will start moving to maintain a certain distance, following the controller. Now DonkiBot is ready to follow you!
If you need to move DonkiBot remotely, simply switch to Remote control mode. With wireless controller, DonkiBot works like any RC car!DonkiBot's drive train consists of two BLDC motors that have enough power to move fully loaded carts at a fast walking speed. Mechanical suspensions help DonkiBot maneuver along a bumpy road easily. The on board battery can be charged using a small adapter that will also be shipped with DonkiBot too. SIngle charge can run DonkiBot for up to 5 hours. Running time is highly dependent on running environment and weight. What makes DonkiBot so special?Whenever people hear about a robot, they are worried about learning to use them. Even robotic engineers at OMOROBOT often have a hard time finding ways to control a robot. So we start thinking about how to make our robot easier to use.Our solution is simple. Just pull the tethered sensor and the robot will follow. Period. No calibration or programming is needed.DonkiBot has been going through rigorous amounts of testing with our engineers to make motion smoother and natural. Here you can see DonkiBot moves better in train mode than before and more robustly in grass playground.If you are working for a sports team and handle a lot of heavy duty material, don't miss the following video!
First prototype was built in 2014 using portable transport cart. If there is more luggage than one cart can handle, just connect second smart cart to rear of the first cart and it will follow like a train!In 2015 we've improved the power train of DonkiBot and now it has enough power to move more than one person weight. DonkiBot has been going through rigorous amount of tests with our engineers to make motion more smoother and natural. Here you can see DonkiBot moves better in train mode than before. And more robust in grass play ground. If you're working in a sports team and handle lots of heavy duty stuffs, don't miss following video! The first proof of concept cubic frame model was tested for demonstration. Magnetic detachable tethered controller found to be very useful.  Connecting one DonkiBot to another is just easy as hooking up to other cart. You don't need to setup anything. The next DonkiBot will follow the front one just like you are pulling it.All generations of DonkiBot is lined up and run in auto follow mode. Now you don't need to pull all the carts at your hand. DonkiBots will just follow you.Once our project is successfully funded, we will start ordering parts and make injection molded frames.We expect most of the parts to arrive at our warehouse in July. In the meantime, software development will be finished and tested. Most of f/w development was done at the start of this project. Only tuning and adjustments are left. 
If nothing seriously goes wrong, we expect to start delivering our first products no later than December of this year! All shipping is based on the order of pledging our project.

I am very excited about launching this project and thank you for having interest in DonkiBot.

155,"To get the best feel for the user interface we recommend watching our project video in high-definition at this link: https://youtu.be/Ny99KzsySHEThe purpose of this project is to deliver cost-effective pick and place machines to makers, businesses, laboratories, academic institutions, and others interested in electronics manufacturing.  A pick and place machine automates the assembly of electronics by picking up tiny electronic components and placing them on circuit boards.Hi, I'm Chris Riegel and my team and I want to build you a pick and place machine.  I'll be personally responsible for the successful delivery of your machine.  The buck stops with me.  I did some of the engineering and integration work for the machine you see in the video.  It has been a pet project of mine since the beginning of the year and a lot of fun.  It allowed me to brush up on my 3D CAD skills, learn a lot about computer vision, make things out of metal with a 4000-watt laser cutter, and meet a lot of cool folks at Maker Faires.   I think the machine is a work of art: from the laser cut gears on our automatic feeders to the 3D input device we're currently integrating (see below); it's a thing of beauty that I'd love to share with you.We use the prototype shown in the video to manufacture the electronics that we sell on our website, so we have a vested interest in it being usable, reliable, and awesome.  We're constantly making improvements to it and it's an incredible machine.  The reliability is now to a point where we feel comfortable offering the machine to others.  However, it's very difficult to know how many folks would actually buy an entry level pick and place machine like ours.  Also, some of the components in the machine have a long lead time, which means it takes weeks for us to get some of the parts that we need from our suppliers.Your backing will go toward acquiring the right number of parts we need to build our machines with the understanding that it will take weeks just to get our raw materials in from our suppliers.  A portion of your funds will also go toward continued development: to make the machine even faster and easier to set up and use.  So this means you should expect some differences between what we're showing you in our video today and what we end up delivering to you.What you see in our project video represents the worst-case scenario you should expect in terms of performance out of the machine that we deliver to you.  We have many ideas for how to speed up the machine and we expect several of those ideas to materialize before delivery.  We will keep you updated all along the way.  The downside is that we can't give you exact specifications on the capabilities of the machine we will deliver to you; the only thing we can say for sure is that it will be better than what's in the video.  Below you'll find some of the ideas we have for near-term delivery so you have some idea of where things are going.CUDA accelerated computer vision with your graphics card Our machine makes heavy use of computer vision and there is an opportunity to make the processing faster by having a graphics card perform some of those vision tasks instead of having the computer's processor do them.  This development will occur while we're waiting for parts to arrive, so the worst-case scenario here is that you have to download an update to the software to enable this feature.Software refactoringWe've been laser focused on making the machine reliable and we need to take some time to clean some sections of our software.  This should make the interface much tighter.  This can also occur while we're waiting for parts to arrive.New head designWe have a concept for a new pick up head that should offer several improvements over our current design.  We have most of the parts to prototype this head and should know how it performs soon, but there is some risk associated with this since it's new and unproven.  The worst-case result is that you end up getting the head design on the machine in the video, which is very unlikely.Our automatic feeders are the biggest differentiator between us and other projects like ours.  We laser cut the parts for our feeders locally. We have a demo video of our previous prototype of the feeders here.Each feeder bus has a master feeder that talks back to the control computer with a USB cable.  Each master feeder can be connected to multiple ""daughter"" feeders through a CAN (Controller Area Network) bus.  The CAN bus is what is used in automobiles for reliable communication among all of the electronics in vehicles.  The feeders are daisy chained together to establish communication from a feeder, to the master feeder, back to the control computer.Various parameters stored on the feeder control the actions of the feeders, such as how many steps the stepper motor should take to advance the tape reel, how long the tape retraction motor should run, and so on.  We will release the details for all of this communication in case someone wants to use our feeders with a different machine.The video shows placements of 0603 and 0805 passives as well as TSSOP-28 (0.65mm pitch) and TQFP-44 (0.8m pitch) packages.  These are not the limits of the machine!  It's just what we use.  We will upload videos to demonstrate the machine's performance with other packages.  If you have a package you're curious about, let us know, or offer to send us a part to try!In terms of components-per-hour: the average placement speed as shown in the video is 260 components-per-hour.  Yes, we know this is on the slow side.  This is with full vision processing on every part (worst case scenario).  If you line up your parts square with your circuit board and don't need to do rotational vision correction on every part you can currently get closer to 850 components-per-hour as demonstrated here.We should be able to move our speed numbers up substantially before shipping.  Our new head will enable this in several ways.  With our current pick up head our computer vision might tell us we need to rotate 3 degrees, then we tell the motor to rotate the part 3 degrees, but then we have to check to see if we actually rotated the part by 3 degrees.  We have to check our work because of the backlash between our motor and our suction tube: with the backlash we might not actually rotate the part a full 3 degrees.  The new head has zero backlash.  So we'll be able to fly over the upward looking camera, grab a snapshot, immediately start on our way to the placement location, and apply the rotational correction as we're dropping the part after the computer vision has operated on the snapshot it took.  The new head will also have the cameras rigidly mounted to it, so we should be able to go faster without the cameras unintentionally moving from the acceleration.",ProtoVoltaics,$213,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Tue, October 20 2015 3:59 AM UTC +00:00",The ProtoVoltaics Pick and Place machine is used to accurately place surface-mount devices (SMDs) onto a printed circuit board (PCB).,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,6, ,0,"$50,000",Pick and Place Machine and/or Automatic SMT Feeders by ProtoVoltaics — Kickstarter
156,"Overview: By 2025 the private sector will be prepared to make millions from discoveries on Mars.   OpenRobotix Labs and our partners plan to be one of the first to benefit from what Mars has to offer.   This will be consider the start of the ""Race to Mars"" era. Our goal with this project is to precede this timeline by building a system capable of sustained flight missions and consequent information/data gathering.  This project will allow us to gather large amounts of data from the planet’s surface faster and with greater detail than any other mission to thus far.   Data that can be used to aid in future research for both the private and the public sector.  Research that can be used to promote future manned missions, aid in the discovery of potential resource deposits or archaeological and biological discoveries.The project plan and the progress established to this point have been funded exclusively by the OpenRobotix Team.   However, OpenRobotix cannot complete this project without the support from enthusiast, adventure seekers and partners. Therefore, the project will be financed by investments from the private sector. In order to accept investments, OpenRobotix has established Openrobotix Labs, Inc. which is a for profit entity in which investors can buy shares.  OpenRobotix Labs holds the exclusive media and intellectual property rights to the Mars Aerial Project and will monetize it to execute the project and to provide investors with a return on their investment. Project: Aerial Rover project is currently in the early proof of concept phase. The project plan and design will be updated and/or modified according to the results Phase 1. The project road map represents an estimate of what to expect as we proceed through to Phase 3 and deployment.
The race to claim Mars is on!  We anticipate the main purpose of the drone will be to collect detailed mineral and land formation data that can be used to determine potential resource deposits that are likely present on or beneath the planet’s surface for future private use.  Donor Benefits: Donors who give $10,000 or more will have live access to all information/data feeds and their names or company logos display on the outer body of the drone.   For anyone who donate towards this project (we would prefer a minimum of $25.00, but any amount will be accepted), we will create a digital beacon with their names listed that will be delivered by the drone to the planet's surface once it begins its survey missions.  All donors will also have access to information obtained by the rover.For more information regarding this project, please contact us at info@openrobotix.com or visit openrobotix.com.  You can also review the project roadmap and a the project cost summary from the above site as well.  Please join is and be apart of something exciting !!!Thank you !",Thomas Parrish (CEO) OpenRobotix Labs,$82,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Tue, December 15 2015 4:08 PM UTC +00:00",OpenRobotix Labs plans to build the first UAV (drone) capable of sustained flight at low light and atmospheric density levels.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,6, Genius!

157,"For a summer project I want to make a remote control submarine. My friends, family and other people can explore while they're near a lake or on a boat. This submarine-type device will find and retrieve items that are lying at the bottom of the lake from the comfort of a dock or a boat. This submersible machine will have a video camera for finding objects and a robotic arm for retrieving. The construction of the sub will be primarily made of PVC pipe because it is easy to work with and inexpensive. By controlling the sub, I will be using an old Play Station 2 controller and a small monitor to assist in navigation. For means of communicating to the sub, I will be using Ethernet cable. Since I am going to go to a depth of about 150 feet, wireless communication will be expensive and too difficult to transmit through water. Also, if anything would happen to the sub and I'm unable to control it, I could easily hoist it up by the Ethernet cable. I will have friends assisting me with this project to speed up the process so we can have fun this summer and start our discoveries.
I’m only going to produce one sub for the time being. I want to see how long it takes to build one and stay within my budget. Upon a successful completion, I will be able to make more and hopefully sell these as a kit for everyone to assemble themselves and explore endless possibilities.Thank you for visiting!  ",Chris,$35,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Wed, May 24 2017 4:08 PM UTC +00:00",Prototyping a PVC remote control sub for viewing and retrieving lost items underwater while staying dry.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,1, ,0,$400,Submersible Item Retriever by Chris — Kickstarter

UNLV was one of just 25 teams worldwide announced as finalists by DARPA. This effort will fund a booth at the DRC to showcase UNLV's efforts and highlight our region's expertise in high-tech. Funds will also go to support roadshows post competition. This is an opportunity to publicly show your support for UNLV and their effort to establish Southern Nevada as a leader in robotics and high technology.In the demonstration event, robots will be tested on capabilities that could enable them to assist first responders during future natural and man-made disasters. UNLV will compete against teams from institutions such as Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Virginia Tech, Lockheed Martin; as well as countries such as Hong Kong, China, Italy, Germany and Japan.UNLV’s team, DRC-HUBO @UNLV, is led by Paul Oh, Lincy Professor for Unmanned Aerial Systems at UNLV. Oh, who is part of the mechanical engineering department in the Howard R. Hughes College of Engineering, is an internationally renowned expert in robotic and autonomous systems with more than 20 years in the field. Oh leads UNLV’s team of post graduate researchers, industry partners, as well as graduate and undergraduate students. “The scope of work that a robot must execute for the DRC is unprecedented,” Oh said. “It is an honor for us at UNLV to be counted among the top roboticists in the world who get to pursue this noble endeavor.”To qualify for the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) finals, the UNLV team had to prove its robot is able to engage an emergency shut-off switch, get up from a prone position, traverse 10 meters without falling, pass over a barrier, and rotate a circular valve 360 degrees.At the challenge in June, the humanoid robot must complete a series of tasks that include crossing rough terrain and debris, climbing stairs, and driving a vehicle. The robot must complete all tasks independently and within one hour, without communicating with the team, being tethered to objects to assist in balance, or using an external power source.The DRC Finals event is free and open to the public and media. In addition to the competition, an on-site robotics exposition (DRC Expo) will showcase technology related to disaster response, robotics, and unmanned aerial systems, and include an overview of DARPA’s mission and legacy. More information about the DRC Finals, the teams, and the DRC Expo can be found at www.theroboticschallenge.org.###

I need your funding to be able to purchase larger vehicles to make Rover more useful. Larger vehicles can have more rechargeable battery space, can have a container to put purchased items into and could be a base for more attachments, which are not a part of this project.My name is Jeremy Ellis and I am the maker of http://www.rocksetta.com  and the IoT Rant at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZYcCXPAMPoFor my day job I have helped people with Tech, Computer Programming and Physics issues for over 2 decades. After work, I normally solve long-term Computer Programming problems of my own choice.  I often then make a Youtube video linking to an example program on Github so that other people can use my Open Source software and also so that I can forget the solution and start working on the next problem.See my videos at :https://www.youtube.com/user/keyfreemusic/videosAbout four months ago, (November 2014) I saw the Spark Core Kickstarter campaign at: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-core-wi-fi-for-everything-arduino-compatible and I was hooked. I wanted to learn everything I could about micro-controllers.So now I have started making prototypes of real objects not just computer programs. The only problem is that my techniques to solve problems often involves multiple versions since I tend to break earlier versions. With real objects this technique is getting a bit expensive. I hope that you can fund my project so that I can continue to make and share my DIY solutions. I have also found out that my experience with Technology and Physics has given me a few skills to help simplify the Internet of Things, and bring those easier techniques to you.The basic idea is to take an RC car and make it work with the Spark Core www.spark.io Then flash a program to the Spark Core that communicates with the car through a standard webpage. I then put my SIM card into an old smartphone and set the phone as a hotspot, then login to Skype and attach the phone to the car. This allows the Spark Core to have Wifi where-ever it goes and using Skype I can see where to drive the car and can communicate with my surroundings. The drone is designed to be able to drive to a neighboring store to pick up small items that have been prepaid for online.RC Car or Truck with a rechargeable battery $90.00, Spark Photon $19.00, Big Motor Driver $50.00, Cell Battery Pack $15.00, wires etc $8.00.Sub-Total = $182.00 + tax(~10%) ~$18.00Total = $200.00This does not account for various electronics shipping costs.Will you be the first in your neighborhood to have a Shopping Drone?

Will you start a Shopping Drone business in your city? Will you have overhead flying Drone Support for your Rovers. Will the overhead support be powerful enough to pick up a damaged drone? As Cities enforce slower speed restrictions on drones, will one person be able to drive several drones at one time from the comfort of a main office? Once a drone has been to a store and delivered the product to a house can the commands be remembered in a file? Can that Drone then replay the file and beep at the office only when human interaction is needed such as when crossing the street? Could one person then control 10 drones at once?

160,"I aim to build an affordable robot, which will seek out radiation and move towards it. This could be useful in a variety of situations. For example, many agricultural goods emit radiation (such as Carrots, Bananas, and Brazil Nuts). The robot would seek out these, and move towards them. Another example at the other end of the scale, is in nuclear disaster zones. The robot would be able to identify and navigate to a source of radiation, with no human involvement. I need the money to build a prototype. All that currently exists are pages and pages of written and drawn plans. The prototype robot will be built from off-the-shelf parts. The cost of these at the moment is £215, although this will be reduced to meet the target price of £200 in the final plans. As I'm a student currently in full-time education, I need some way to finance the cost of building the prototype. When I've built the prototype, I will write up the designs into a set of easy-to-follow instructions. I aim to also make schematic diagrams and PCB files, and I will release all these as open-source documents, along with the code. If the demand is there, I may consider producing kits, although this would probably require a second Kickstarter campaign. The prototype robot will be built on a Raspberry Pi A+, and will use a Geiger-Müller tube to read radiation levels. The Geiger-Müller tube will be rotated until it finds an unusually high radiation level, which will trigger the robot to move forwards. The Raspberry-Pi will have a a HAT board, which will have inputs/outputs for servo motors and for the Geiger-Müller tube. In the prototype, I will use a Sparkfun Geiger-Müller tube board, as it will allow me to easily experiment with the Geiger-Müller tube itself, and it comes in a readily available package. When the final plans are released, I aim to incorprate the Geiger-Müller tube circuitry into the design of the HAT board, which should reduce the cost considerably. * The robot is currently scheduled to cost around £200 in parts, excluding VAT. This may change in the future, as I refine the designs. The remaining £90 in the campaign are to cover taxes, Kickstarter's costs, and backer reward.

It should buy us fifty years or more. During that time we will either figure out what is important or refuel the engine of assured self-destruction. Our memories seem to be short. In the mean time it will do for transportation what the internet has done for communication and the ipod has done for music.The project description starts out with a written version of the video, with images embedded, and then continues with the more detailed explanation of why the system is needed, what problems are lessened or eliminated  and how it works. Also on the website are pieces about how the system would effect the economy and the opportunities it presents and how it should work in tandem with the redesign of our cities for healthy people and a healthier planet The fifty years should provide enough time to figure out how to live WITH the planet instead of fighting or trying to subjugate it, which is very similar to cutting off the branch you are sitting on, to make a fire to keep warm, when you have a coat sitting there unused or or are on a tropical island anyway.

I'm assuming the words exhaustion and impatience describe your experience.Now imagine this: You go to the store (for groceries, building materials, furniture, etc.) and select a LoadAUF by scanning it with your smart phone application. LoadAUF follows you around the store, doing all the work of carrying your products for you. You pull up next to an item you'd like, and scan it for purchase, and place it in LoadAUF. After scanning one item, LoadAUF suggests items other customers have purchased along with that product, reminding you you're forgetting something. And once you're all done gathering your products, you skip the lines and pay on your application. You're done. You just had fun shopping, and now you just cant wait to come back. Mind... blown! •̀.̫•́How much time of our day do just waste by waiting for someone? In these modern times where
everyone seems to be in a hurry and not have time for anything, we need to start thinking of ideas
that will make our lives simpler and more streamlined. With that in mind, we noticed how the
average shopping experience was very time consuming and not very simple. For example, it’s very
common that when a you need help, an assistant might be from a department that can’t really help the customer, so it takes time to find the proper person with the right knowledge
to help the person. Based on this idea, we decided to work on a project that will reduce the hassle of going
shopping, and will give you any assistance whenever needed. Starting with an multi-use, autonomous cart, we are in the midst of redesigning the entire retail shopping experience. Our goal is to marry the simplicity of online shopping with the benefits of seeing a product in person in a retail store.• Carry up to 600 lbs • Costs less than $500.00 to produce• Energy efficient• Application - User-friendly - Product
information search/product recommendations - Secure payments LoadAUF is expected to operate in an indoor space with  numerous obstacles. Our multi-purpose cart should be able to operate efficiently for individual and industrial user.In the future we hope to focus in the hard-goods, retail industry for which LoadAUF should be able to navigate through other carts and narrow walking spaces. LoadAUF's
autonomous movement is designed to navigate safely, with high precision maneuverability.
The hardline retail industry poses several specific challenges in operating the LoadAUF. The
physical nature of the products in this industry are relatively heavier, and have non-uniform shapes.
This was considered in the design of the cart's platform weight threshold, and shape. It is also
expected to withstand significant impulses from users placing items on the platform, as well as be
able to keep in place products of different packing texture.
Users' and store employees' familiarity with traditional store requires LoadAUF to
be able to withstand at least the same stresses to the body of the cart during handling and storage.LoadAUF’s design and marketing aimed to capitalize on solving critical global issues,
placing it in an advantageous position to launch itself as a leader in the international market. It’s
fast mobile checkout module replaces the inefficient wait-in-line retail model. This allows it to
target the rapidly growing cultural changes in modern economies that emphasize reducing
inefficiency. By providing an interactive product search module and eliminating physical burdens
through automated following, LoadAUF also appeals to the traditional views prevalent in other
cultures that focus on providing an enjoyable shopping experience for the user. By understanding
this two-fold cross-cultural issue, focusing on interactivity, ease-of use, and time efficiency, LoadAUF’s user interface appeals to the needs of users from diverse social, cultural, and economic
backgrounds, it is a true example of a global product.",LoadAUF,$49,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Wed, June 8 2016 9:01 PM UTC +00:00","Carrying heavy loads is so 19th century, and pushing them 20th.

167,"Using diverse payloads drones can be used to perform a variety of tasks, ranging from surveillance missions to even delivering small packages.

Our vision with XDrones focuses on enabling and simplifying the operation and use of aerial drone technology to the consumer and commercial industries in areas such as agriculture, construction, humanitarian missions, private security, among others. As an example, farmers spray pesticides uniformly over their crops to protect them from pests or fungal infections. An XDrone fitted with an HD camera enables farmers to regularly get a bird’s eye-view of their crop by flying at low altitude. Then, farmers can selectively spray pesticides only on plants that need attention, thus minimizing environmental damage and saving money.

A private security guard could use an XDrone every couple of hours to make his routine rounds on a defined perimeter around a building; the XDrone sends him a real-time video feed, thus increasing security and providing constant vigilance of the property.However, drones are, as yet, a fairly technical affair. While their operations have been simplified, drones still require still highly technical knowledge. XDrones aims to simplify operation of drones by abstracting technology from the end user. We plan to achieve this by leveraging open source firmware currently used in popular flight controllers paired with a minimum set of remote-control and electronic components that would allow XDrones to fly predefined autonomous missions assigned to physical buttons on the device.

During the Mission Planning stage, the user draws out an automated flight path for the mission, defines actions (i.e. release package). Subsequently, the user uploads the missions to the XDrone and it’s handed over to any operator that can have the XDrone run those missions as many times as he want.The PlanThis project will be managed via an agile-scrum methodology that breaks down deliverables into user stories. By doing this we expect much greater control on the feature set and would be able to constantly deliver capabilities on a frequent basis. Below is a list of our backlog and high level plan: Here's our XDrone v1.0 concept design, which is optimized for space of all electronic components (i.e. GPS, flight and speed controllers, etc), durability, an almost 90 degrees field of view for camera, and magnetic package gripper for package delivery.",Jaime Botero,"$1,217","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Wed, May 27 2015 9:48 PM UTC +00:00",Use of aerial drones to automate repetitive tasks,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,5, @Creator Sounds like great idea!!Can you please explain what would come with DIY $150 reward?

168,"The Perchino™ is a new high-tech control box for the popular SeaPerch Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV).  It replaces the standard ""SeaSwitch"" box with a smart, Arduino based, controller that uses a standard gaming interface for smooth and comfortable control.  It's compact, hack-able and perfect for a wide range of motorized projects.- o - o - o - o - o - o -The Perchino™ design team is made up of four hyper-nerdy College students (Kendrick, Kevin, AJ and Derrick) who have about 30 years of competitive robotics experience between them.  They are led by a veteran project manager (Mr. Phil), who has spent at least that many years designing embedded computer systems
for underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) and other robotic systems.When Phil first encountered the SeaPerch ROV 6 years ago, he wanted to use it with Middle-Schoolers, but hand-wiring all the switches was too difficult for young kids.  So he designed simple PCB to use in the control box, and donated that design to the SeaPerch community.  This SeaSwitch control box greatly simplified the construction, and improved the reliability, of the overall system.  The SeaSwitch is now standard on all SeaPerch's.The SeaSwitch controller is fine for beginners, but the ON/OFF style of motor control is very cumbersome if you want to move beyond the basic SeaPerch, and enhance it for tele-operation.  You also need smoother control if you want to add sensors or manipulators.   Now it's time to kick it up a notch with an all new control box called the Perchino™ (Perch-ee-no). The
Perchino™ combines three enabling technologies:  An Arduino CPU, a PS2
controller interface, and four state-of-the-art motor-driver chips.  These components come together to form an
ergonomic, highly agile, ROV controller with wireless capabilities, and hack-able control algorithms.Note: There's no need to add an Arduino, it's already in there.  Just unplug the SeaSwitch control box, plug in the Perchino™ and add your favorite PS2 controller.We've been working hard, and have developed several successful prototypes. We love our current hardware, but we still have a few enhancements in the works.  The team is also experimenting with different
software builds and creating an open-source Arduino library to make it easy for beginners to develop custom
controls and automated functions.As a final incentive, don't forget that the Perchino™ can also double as a generic quad-motor controller.  Feel free to use it on any motor powered project, like a remote controlled tank or an interactive art project.  There are fixed NRE (Non Recurring Engineering) costs associated with the Perchino™ circuit board and enclosure, so we have set our Kickstarter goal to enable us to order sufficient quantities to get some really good prices for everyone.  We have set our goal at an initial order of 250 units, and if we exceed this, we will be able to add some cool stretch goals.We've created some low-cost, and early-bird rewards that will let you make your mark on the Perchino™ Community while you have some fun with the Perchino™ team. We're also providing a pledge reward that will enable you to have our team create a custom flight/control mode to suit your specific project needs. These new control modes will be included with the standard Perchino code for everyone to use. The new modes will be named by the backers who fund them.Remember that we are all about the hobbyist robotics/maker community with an emphasis on STEM education, so just as with the original SeaSwitch, our goal is to build the Perchino™ into a new piece of enabling technology to help inspire kids into Science and Technology careers.Just to recap, here's why the Perchino™ is worth the extra dollars over a standard SeaSwitch. Here is a video of Kevin demonstrating the basic Perchino™ operation with a wireless PS2 controller.For more information, check out the preliminary design brief at the BitsForBots.com website.",Mr. Phil,$441,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Mon, November 24 2014 3:42 PM UTC +00:00","Sick of clicking switches to fly your SeaPerch?

The robot has a hybrid power system, you only put the gas and the electrical system runs all the electrical motors and charges the battery. You don't need to stop to charge batteries.The DetailsSnowBYTE is a remote controlled snow cleaning robot. The physical properties of the robot are: Collector Dimensions: 32'' (80cm) width, 20'' (50cm) height. Robot Dimensions: 32'' width, 38'' height and 46'' (115cm) length. Gasoline Engine: 5.5 HP, 196cc, air cooled. Robot Speed: 15metre/min. Drive System: 4 x 4, electrical drive, 16'' (40cm) wheel diameter, air filled wheels. Weight: 160 kgs.Control: 6 channel remote controlled. Lights: 35W front lights, chute lights, back lights, flashing back lights.The collector size sets the amount of snow at one pass you can clean, so we tried to make the collector very big. The 5.5HP engine provides the necessary power to the system. By putting front and back lights we increased the visibility. The flashing lights are to take even more attention.The chute has the capacity to turn 360 degrees. The chute lights help you to see where you are blowing when it is dark.The auger is designed to cut snow and the front bar works as a bumper. The 4 by 4 drive system provides the power to mobilize the robot and allows easy turns and driving. The salt box controlled by the remote allows you to throw salt while you clean the snow.Since the auger design is completely innovative, we built a 3D prototype to see the effectiveness of it. When testing the blades, washing soap was used because the density and grain structure are similar to those of snow.The gasoline engine powers an alternator to generate the necessary electrical power on the robot. The electrical energy runs the drive system, lights and electronics and it charges the batteries. The robot has a battery pack to start the gasoline engine and to allow the user to drive the robot for a short period of time so that the robot can be parked without running the engine.For safety, the robot has an emergency button and the gasoline engine also can be stopped from the remote control instantly.We would like to start mass manufacturing and we need your help.Things you will recieve for supporting us:The Team:  I have always enjoyed building things. I am so glad I make robots, sometimes I call my job as making toys. Of course a good education helps too. I have both mechanical and electrical engineering degrees (Duke and University of Virginia), and I encourage my students to be as much as they can be.

Simply set your alarm clock and activate a Bluetooth connection with the device. When an alarm is triggered, Roby will start singing and dancing (depending on your alarm tune) and will wake you up in a friendly manner.    Roby d'Bear is also available as a kit model. Kit includes all necessary parts to build robot from scratch. Instruction manuals included.        There are quite a few challenges when developing a new product. We have designed, repaired, re-designed multiple models until we finally found the right one. Development includes not only design and construction, but also all other fields of knowledge and expertise such as marketing, sales and production. During that process we have learned more than we first expected. Challenges and problems appeared on every step of the way and we had to overcome them. Finally we have our product ready for launch and we need you to help us realize our dreams. ",d'Bear by Robotic Drive Team,"$2,330","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Tue, July 11 2017 1:30 PM UTC +00:00",Entertainment robot with audio and docking station controlled via app on your mobile phone or tablet.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,53, ,0,"$200,000",Roby d'Bear by Robotic Drive Team — Kickstarter
174,"Recently, we won first place at the 2014 Student Professional Development Conferences at Texas Tech in Lubbock, Texas and have been invited to proceed to the final competition at the ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition in Montreal, Canada. We never thought that the friendship we shared would pay off like it did for our team. Our journey started as we became more involved with our university’s student organizations, especially the American Society of Mechanical Engineers(ASME). It was through ASME that we learned about the various venues skilled and talented students could pursue and expand their interests. The event we chose was the Student Professional Development Conference(SPDC) Student Design Competition aimed at the creation and implementation of drones to fight forest fires. With a goal in sight we set out on our own to build the best machine we could, from scratch. Possessing the passion that only a group of college students could, we found time between our busy class schedule and social responsibilities to design, build, program and fly a quad copter that would take us to first place against other schools from around the nation.
	Although we were able to accomplish this grand task, there is still work to be done. Each team member has contributed to their limit, including all of the prize money that was awarded to us individually. Unfortunately, drone building does not merit the same fervor and camaraderie that a sport like baseball or basketball would(for some people) and so support in the way of funding for our trip is scarce. It has been left to us to gather the resources we need in order to make it to the competition.

176,"We started this project because we wanted to provide a high-performance robot platform at a low price.  We figured that interfacing a radio-controlled car to an Arduino would be the way to go.We considered lots of different approaches - having the Arduino interface to the RC vehicle's motor controller (requires knowing where to solder wires on different RC vehicles) or replacing the RC vehicle's motor controller with our own custom motor controller (adds considerable expense).  Then we realized, if we want to make this work for lots of different people with a range of skills, let's just create a circuit that takes the Arduino commands and then mimics the RC vehicle's transmitter radio signal.Here's a block diagram of how this board works with the Arduino.The Arduino microcontroller generates Forward/Backward/Left/Right commands, just like an RC car operator would do with a handheld transmitter.  But in this case, the Arduino is responding to information from its sensors (something you'll need to think about for your specific robot design) and then passing those commands along to the Wireless Interface Board, which creates RF commands that mimic the signals that a handheld transmitter would create.The Arduino commands come out on digital output bits P2 through P5 from the Arduino board.This is our prototype.  It's been tested at both 27 MHz and 49 MHz (the two versions of the board have identical layouts but differ in the components needed in the RF section).Here's a little demo video that we made showing how easy the Wireless Interface Board is to use.  For this demo, the Arduino is programmed with a simple test program that makes the rear wheels of the RC car go forward, then backward and then makes the front wheels turn to the right and then to the left.We wanted to make the Arduino/Wireless Interface Board a stand-alone assembly, so we added a 9V battery to the Wireless Interface Board to optionally power both the Arduino and the Wireless Interface Board.There are basically three different frequencies used for Radio-Controlled vehicles (at least for the U.S.).  Most inexpensive RC vehicles use either 27 MHz or 49 MHz.  The reason for two different frequencies is so that two different vehicles can be used simultaneously (for example, racing).A third frequency, 2.4GHz, is now used for many of the more expensive RC vehicles.  This is the same frequency band as used for many cordless phones, wireless routers, etc.  2.4GHz is not supported by the Bitstream Technology Wireless board.  Only the 27MHz and 49MHz are supported.The ""carrier"", which is what the 27MHz or 49MHz signal is called, is turned on and off for particular periods of time.  This on/off timing is set by the transmitter chip.  Most RC vehicle transmitters use a generic set of transmitter and receiver chips, called TX-2 and RX-2.  The TX-2 chip is used in the Bitstream Technology Wireless Interface, so it is compatible with most radio-controlled vehicles.Some RC vehicle manufacturers use their own proprietary transmitter chips.  For example, NewBright, which is a brand sold at Wal-Mart and other discount stores, uses their own proprietary chip.  To date, we have not been able to procure NewBright transmitter chips, so the Bitstream Technology Wireless Interface board is not compatible with NewBright vehicles.Most robots will need sensors to avoid collisions or to follow lines, etc. You'll interface these sensors to the Arduino, just like you would any other Arduino-based robot.So where are we with this project?  We've built working prototypes for both the 27 MHz and 49 MHz, tested them with a number of radio-controlled cars and trucks, and we've figured out what features we need to add (just a couple of simple things like a ""device-on"" LED and an on/off switch)What we need to do next, and what this Kickstart project will allow us to do, is to go into production with the board and figure out the logistics of supporting large orders, something we don't have experience with.",Dan Harres,$865,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Wed, July 8 2015 2:59 PM UTC +00:00",This circuit board is an Arduino shield that lets you turn your radio-controlled car into a robot.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,11," Hi Dan,we (my 8 y.o. son and me) belive your project is fantastic, we started a couple of month ago to explore togheter the arduino board and its sensors.

178,"By backing this project, you are supporting development of a new kind of patented Torus Wheel with some amazing capabilities.It creates energy-efficient vertical ascent, traverse, and descent, into an easy, safe, simple, elegant, ""accessible to all"", and ""nearly everywhere"" - experience.AND for the focus of this Kickstarter, you are backing something even more important - stopping the #2 cause of global warming!The Issue - Current lift methods for payloads usually employ ladders or rope-gear, jacks, scissor & bucket lifts, rappel gear, cranes, or other expensive, dangerous, and destructive methods.Their disadvantages include:  fall-risk; power-line hazard; toppling; deployment of heavy & large equipment with requisite access roads; a need to block traffic when in use; high initial & running costs; licensed operator expense & scheduling; property damage including forest lawn & trees; very high physical demand & risk; and increased costs with height.The Solution - Ross Garside's US and globally-filed Patent, which is in final approval stages, creates a new type of Torus-wheel drive transmission that eliminates ALL of these climbing / lifting issues, and requires no brakes.Ross paid Penn State Learning Factory to build the functional prototypes shown in the videos, and both have won awards there for Best Project, beating out 70+ major corporation's engineering projects, including NASA.  http://bit.ly/18raYqY  (search for PHOD).Ross learned of the difficulties that the volunteers of www.rfcx.org (Rainforest Connection) were having in deploying solar-powered cellphones invented by Topher White.These solar cellphones protect Rainforests from illegal logging and poaching, by detecting chain saw, truck, or gun sounds, and then texting the coordinates to the authorities.Illegal logging of Rainforests is the #2 cause of atmospheric CO2 rise & global warming.So our mutual cause is rather critical to the planet and our descendants; so much so that National Geographic has designated Topher a ""Nat Geo Young Explorer"", with many other environmental backers helping him.In order for Topher's organization to protect most of the world's rainforests, a new tool is needed to drastically speed up, and make far safer, his solar-cellphone deployment process.RainForest Elevator is that tool.Ross realized that his back-packable, non-damaging climbing technology was just what Topher needs to cut their risk and deployment time down drastically, so he contacted Topher, who has agreed that he needs them and is assisting us.The major risk is that his volunteers use climbing gear to deploy the solar-cellphones, sometimes 120+ ft. up the tree, plus the awkward method can sometimes take over a day per deployment.The long deployment dwell time puts his volunteers at risk of being shot, as the illegal loggers often come armed.We seek your funding for this Kickstarter, to create additional Climbers with optimized design changes that should permit our Climbers to deploy RFCX's cellphone arrays in minutes, rather than days, and leave his cellphone array attached to the tree. The Climber will then be brought back down, reloaded for another tree, and repeated until the entire forest area is protected.This should speed up deployment from 1 per day, to 10 or more, making Topher White's goal of protecting all rain forests globally, a reality.RainForest Elevator should also be able to place the solar cellphones higher, which increases the solar-cellphones stealthiness and range.Each deployed cellphone protects about a square mile of Rainforest.Your support will permit Ross Garside to procure technical assistance from Penn State Learning Factory (PSU-LF) that creates those climbers with a newly designed Solar Cellphone attachment feature, optimized for use by RainForest Connection.This project's money will likely be used for two simultaneous Penn State Learning Factory Projects in Dec. 2016, unless a another capability is developed before then.One project will make at least three additional manufacturable designs, sending two to Rainforest Connection (RFCX) for testing and feedback.The other project will develop the solar cellphone tree attachments which our climber will deploy for testing.Our climbing technology is not limited to trees, as it can climb most any manner of column shape, beam, or pipe; even irregular, square, or angled ones, even going around curves in any direction, with minimal setup changes.Since the payload and scale of our climber can be most any size or lift-capability, Ross has interested the US Forest Service for tree-pest and canopy studies; hunters for automatic tree stands; manhunt surveillance in woods (think - the $10M spent to find Eric Freind); temporary venue surveillance (e.g. Boston Marathon & HS Football TV highlights); NASA-Ames in a new type of mass-transit system that avoids a need to build roads (saving trees & also cutting CO2); and the 90+ other NAICs product markets which PHOD has potential to impact.Although our current Kickstarter goal should meet our initial requirements from RFCX, additional funds beyond that will be used to get RFCX orders into production, and jump-start variations off that design into Temporary Venue Surveillance products, and the other 90+ products we've identified as potential product markets.Please support our project!Help Save the Planet!Change it for the better!Make accidental deadly falls a thing of the past.Help Ross Garside develop the next focus product from this technology - Temporary Venue Surveillance.Thank you for supporting Rainforest Elevator technology.Ross Garside",Ross Garside,"$1,720","Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Tue, January 19 2016 6:02 AM UTC +00:00",Help STOP Climate Change! www.nearthco.com can build devices to help stop illegal logging (& poaching).,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,27, ,0,"$17,500",Rainforest Elevator THE Big Lift to Help Stop Global Warming by Ross Garside — Kickstarter
179,"Seek N’ Sneak is an Arduino powered self-controlled robot which is able to run around, find objects, grab them, relocate them and do many other useful and funny things.

Why did we develop this robot? There is a very short answer: kids! They need 10 to 30 minutes (depending on their temper) to scatter literally all the toys they have over their rooms, so initially we were looking for some way to automate a tedious process of daily toys collection. We solved this problem, but we realized that there are many other cool applications for this robot. We found that our robot can be smart, fast, strong, fearless and funny, just like a badger, and we named it Seek N’ Sneak. - Seek N’ Sneak robot at a glance.The two driving wheels of this robot are powered by independently controlled motors and equipped with 128-steps-per-revolution (or similar) encoders allowing for precise control of the angular position of the wheel, as well as its velocity and acceleration.An independent 2D orientation of the rover is provided by two side mounted IR proximity meters. Objects are detected by the third centered IR proximity meter. The three IR sensors can be replaced by one PING)))™ Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.The arm is run by 3 super-strong servo-motors, so it is fast and powerful enough to push up about 3 pounds, or even lift the robot itself, or throw objects.Seek N’ Sneak is an Arduino Mega 2560 powered robot. The robot software is completely open sourced, so you can either use the original software which has already been developed for you, or you can modify it as you please to meet your demands. You can then use commands like LOOK FOR AN OBJECT, GRAB or THROW instead of writing low-level code to control the sensors, motors and servos directly or develop your own way of thinking for the robot from scratch using the Arduino integrated development environment.
 Though Seek N’ Sneak was designed as a fully autonomous, upgradable robot, there is plenty of space inside the body of the robot to extend Arduino board with extra sensors or with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth shields to establish communication with a computer or remote control.Seek N’ Sneak’s body and arm parts, depending on the kit you choose, are made of either 5mm laser cut black acrylic glass, 3mm laser cut galvanized aluminum or 2mm milled carbon-fiber composite.

8.4 - 9.6V accumulator (not included*) is used as the only power supply.The most impressive thing is that the robot runs as a fully independent unit:  

 You are only limited by your imagination.YES, if you have a very basic knowledge in electronics and programming OR if you are able to accurately follow simple instructions, then you can do it! Seek N’ Sneak robot is provided as a kit, so you will need some basic tools including wrenches, screwdrivers, diagonal cutter and soldering set. For young technicians supervision is recommended.
The Seek N’ Sneak robot can also be a great gift to get your child interested in robotics. Since the databank of free softw­­­­are will be continuously replenished, people with no programming background can also enjoy the fun of robotics. No matter if you are an experienced programmer, a robotics fan, or a school teacher trying to interest kids in robotics, the Seek N’ Sneak is a great way to learn about mechanics, electronics and programming… All in one!The standard Seek N’ Sneak kit contains everything* you need to complete the assembly of the robot including 
  You will be provided with a full step-by-step tutorial explaining how to assemble your Seek N’ Sneak robot. Moreover, you will get the intermediate programming sketches that will help you to properly connect and test all the electronic parts one by one.   * Accumulator is not included; see recommended type of accumulator here (9.6V).   

** You can replace it with Arduino UNO as it has exactly as many pins as needed. However we strongly recommend Mega 2560 board because it gives you a lot of room for experiments with additional drives, sensors, screens, pushbuttons or LEDs.
We want to share the design and our experience building the Seek N’ Sneak robot with developers all around the world. So after the KickStarter campaign, the Seek N’ Sneak robot in its entirety will be released to the public! Our aim is a community of robotic fans - we count on your participation as a developer. With your help we will be able to establish a network of all Seek N’ Sneak robot developers. You will be able to share and borrow ready-to-use code and find support from other robot builders. At the same time we will be continuously working on new features for existing robot and develop new robots to meet your expectations. Just imagine how much we can do, working together on this project. However, all of this can only be done with your support… With your funding we can make the Seek N’ Sneak robot even better, more affordable and easily accessible to everyone.Share the news about our campaign on social media (Instagram, Facebook, Google+, Twitter, etc.).

180,"Hey everybody! My name is John Kennedy, I am going into my senior year at the university of Arkansas as a Biomedical Engineering student. I have 4 different minors that include English, History, Nanotechnology, and Math. I am also a medical school applicant and hope to someday work in the neurosurgery field in design and implantation. My senior design thesis involves designing a working model of an advanced prosthetic design that we like to call ""smart"" prosthetics. We have all seen on the news the man with no arm or leg with a robotic arm that he can operate by thought. The way these designers go about doing this is through a wire that they surgically implant into the brain. My goal is to take this technology to the next level. I have collaborated with a few of the biomedical and biological professors on research of substance called graphene. Basically its thin sheets of graphite. They can be made into wire on a nano scale and can conduct electricity. On top of this, they are completely made of carbon. The ultimate goal is to use this graphene and basically attach it to the nerve ending of an appendage (arm, leg) that have been amputated and have it basically run to a series of devices that can decipher the bodies electrical impulses, this in turn will cause movement. This project is my first attempt to bring to life what I have drawn up in my head and on paper. The funds from this project will be used during my senior year, along with collaboration from my design partner, to build a model and present our theory of what we want to bring to the industry. I hope to be a game changer, and who knows, we may find a different substance that works better than graphene. However, the principal remains the same, I want to build smarter, less invasive, and more cost effective prothetics that can serve as an extension of ones self in a more fluid like fashion. It's a big dream and a big goal, one that I hope will have the support of those around me to help become reality.

His impressive work envelope allows you greater room to interact with objects.Mounting optionsHEW can also be mounted in various ways. With a standard base design you can mount him when and where you want him, on the ceiling, on the wall or floor. His removable suction cups allow this to be a simple and yet easy process.SpecificationsHEW's 6-axis movement combined with his speed and working envelope makes him extremely useful and allows for a large depth of movementsWe are delighted and proud to say that HEW is made in the UK. So much so that it is etched into the base of every unit we make.Not only that 90% of all the parts used are produced/sourced locally right here in the UK.If our kickstarter is successful one of the promises we want to make is that everything you see here will be available after the campaign has ended. The only special kickstart item is the printed and signed canvases, other than that if we've advertised it you can get it.The funding from our kickstarter will help us sell our first ever units along with costs associated with making them, it will also allow us to dedicate more time to the products to improve shipping time, production costs and ultimately make even better products. From this we will also find a more suitable office to work in,other than our front room!He wasn't always that stylish.HEW was made entirely using CAD models, a cost effective solution but not without its downfalls. The first drawback of CAD was that even though the model mechanics worked in theory, the actual model might have constraints or issues that couldn't be seen on the model. A second drawback is that you never get to actually see or feel the real product.The best thing to do was to make early prototypes. These were created to prove that the key mechanics worked, while also allowing to us to see and feel the product in real life.Ok so HEW DV1 didn't look stylish in the first prototype, but the mechanics were there and more importantly they were working. However the aluminium wasn't very nice, he felt heavy and the wrist just wasn't for us.So bring on the next prototype!This time HEW DV2 turned out much better. We had to make some changes to the wrist and base but overall he was looking good. Once the key mechanics were set and the material was chosen we went on to improve him even more and we finally ended up with the DV4 version that you see here today. However it wasn't always fun and games though. Some flaws did crop up this didn't stop us, it improved us, from a number of different prototypes and tests we ended up with the HEW-DV4 unit.HEW is just the beginning, we don't just want to finish here we intend to make even more amazing products for our customers. Future developments have always been a key driver and we've got a number of different product ideas we want to make! Some of which include more features for our robot arms, such as new grippers and attachments and bigger, stronger and faster arms to help your projects come to life!Not only that we have other ideas such as different platforms, prototyping services and more!

185,"Introduction    The project start with the idea of a self cocktail dispenser for my future billiard club (july 2016). I made some research on internet to found few similar projects made by others but never exactly what I want! At the end,  I want to make cocktail with more than 50 bottles on the wall, the biggest list of cocktails available in one dispenser, multiple heads dispenser, head movement for shot, medium and large cocktails, random selection mode and more. I didn’t find any with that specification! And those I found are very expensive. I decided to start project from bottom with the specifications I want.     I want to offer it at lower cost too. I made it for me but I’ll made it also for you and all your dispenser project!  Important Note     This dispenser can be convert to anything you want! Not only cocktails can be made with it. Only the tube used need to be compatible with the product you want to control. A lot of possibility! Juice dispenser? Chemical dispenser? (for pool as exemple) and more!Please help me to make my project a sucess.A website will be create for the project after the first objectif will be reach.First Objective (7 500$)    To start I built a prototype of the ''Single bottle dispenser'' with a small microcontroller. It will deliver 1 to 5 oz (selectable by a knob) and a dispense push button. Generous backers will receive one or more single head dispenser as a gift. Go to the video page to see it! Real prorotype with peristatic pump will be done soon, samples pumps ares in the mail...! Vising my page frequently to see future update!     This system you'll receive will be configure to fit future update of the project.  All pumps will able to fit on the new board with 3.5'' touch screen. This board should be ready before the end of the first objective. I'm working to make a prototype with 50 LEDs output before the end of the first objective. You'll able to see it work with the database! New update about it expected in 30 to 40 days. Continued to visit my page to see changes.This first objective will help me to make that new board running with database and real peristaltics pumps and your gift!What do you think of having your personnal UAD? (from 1 bottle to 50), your donation will help me to make it possible! Second objective (15 000$)     After the first 50 bottles dispenser will be made, I want to make it bigger. I planned to add a 2 others heads to the dispenser! 3 cocktails will be fill at the same time, in short period of time. It will be very easy to fill a lot of drink in few minutes. Third objective (30 000$ to 50 000$)    
I want to push the project from 3 heads to fill a box of 12 cocktails at the same time. Only 30 second to one minute will be needed to fill a box of medium or large cocktails. Very interesting for bar or big party setup!Final Objective (60 000$ and more)- Optimization of the dispenser environnement. - Send task by mobile application (for home user).- Built a frame to fix the pump- Portable unit on wheels- Self-service with card payment- Suggestion from you!At the end it will become the Ultimate Automatic dispenser!

187,"Hi I'm Ron, an undergraduate student at Washington and Lee University. I have a passion for robotics and photography and I am working on a project to capture the most picturesque scenes of the Washington and Lee campus and the surrounding area. The goal of this project is to raise enough money to buy the new DJI Inspire 1 and capture images in stunning detail. Some Background: As I have stated above, I am an undergraduate freshman at W&L working on my Bachelors degree in Biology under a pre-medicine track. I grew up in South Florida and was afforded the opportunity to come to Washington and Lee under the Questbridge National Match Scholarship (a scholarship specifically for low income minorities). Ever since arriving in Lexington I have been amazed by not only the campus, but also, the surrounding country side. I was so moved that I decided to purchase a used DJI Phantom 2 Vision. The Vision allowed me to combine my love of robotics and flight (I have nine approved flight hours in a Cessna 172) with a passion for photography. It has allowed me to create some beautiful images, but it is not well adapted to the strong winds of the area and its single axis stabilization is not suited for videography.The DJI Inspire 1 has a three axis 12 megapixel camera paired with a nine element lens. It will allow me to take my photography to a whole new level and it will also capture the historic W&L campus like never before. The Inspire 1 will also be used to work on a 3D map of W&L which will be developed with Google Sketchup and eventually included in Google Earth for all to see. The Inspire 1's final task will be to videotape virtual tours for prospective students to experience the school in a whole new way. If this project is successful then the current Vision that I own will be donated to start a drone development program in conjugation with W&L's computer science program that I would like to develop to include local high schools. Some of my previous captures:Please note that Kickstarter has reduced the quality of the images to make sure they load faster. The printed images will be of much higher quality.Money Usage:The Inspire 1 costs $2900 not including tax so the $3000 dollars will cover a majority of the cost of the drone. Any money raised above $3000 will first be put into getting the $3300 option that includes two remote controls and will allow for a designated photographer while I fly the drone. Any money above that will be used for purchasing extra batteries that cost $160-$200.Any donation is appreciated and I wouldn't be able to do this without any of you.",Ron Perets,$4,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Tue, March 10 2015 4:48 AM UTC +00:00",Creating stunning imagery through the use of advanced drones in Lexington Virginia and the surrounding area.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,4, I donated to leave a comment...lol.

188,"There are a lot of robots in the world. But most only have the capability to do one thing. Those that can do more cost tens of thousands of dollars.Jerry is the first personal robot that is affordable as well as capable enough to be used for any number of different tasks and applications. What does Jerry do? You might as well ask what did the original Apple II do? ""The reason it has taken so long for the robotics industry to move forward is because people keep trying to make something that is cool but difficult to achieve rather than trying to find solutions to actual human problems."" ~Colin Angle, CEO of iRobotThe Hardware is ExpensiveUnlike computers, robots have physical parts that don't follow Moore's Law. And if you have a robot with an arm, then all those motors and gears really start to add to the cost sheet.

 Simple Mechanisms Instead of MotorsJerry has been made affordable by simplifying many of the mechanisms as far as possible while remaining functional. Two motors were never used where one would do. Any other approach is just lazy design.

If this had not been the approach then Jerry would have cost tens of thousands of dollars, like all the rest, and not have been any more useful.Jerry is made of wood. Every structural and visible piece came from a tree. We essentially put motors in a cabinet.

Look at your house. Is it made of glass? Are there white lights and curved white furniture sitting everywhere? Probably not.Designed to Look Like FurnitureJerry is meant to look like  a piece of furniture. He makes his statement when people see that he is a robot bringing a soda. When he is just waiting around or sweeping the floor it is better if he is not gaudy.

Wood has also let us keep costs down in manufacturing as well as create a platform that can be easily modified and hacked by adventurous hobbyists that might like to add something to Jerry.Simplified MechanicsTake a moment to imagine that you don't have a wrist. Add in that your shoulder can't swing your arm sideways. Now try to open a door or grab a soda. You can probably still do it, right. Its a bit awkward but it is by no means impossible.Many robots have endless points of articulation in an emulation of a human arm. This is nice for a research group or for a person, but is it really necessary?Then there is the matter of cost. A robot with an arm is often very expensive because of the complexity of the parts in the arm. So Jerry's arm was stripped to its bare essentials. The design maximizes the utility of every moving part of the machine so expensive components could be kept to a minimum.RetractableWhen not in use Jerry's arm is stowed to maintain his neutral exterior and ensure that the arm will not be damaged. It is also just cool to have a robot with a retractable arm.Driven by Linear ActuatorsIn order to maximize the weight that Jerry could lift, he uses a cable system driven by linear actuators in his base. This not only eliminates extraneous weight on the arm, but moves it low on Jerry so that it is more difficult for him to fall over.Large WorkspaceJerry has a large workspace letting him work in human environments. He can reach over counters, into a fridge, and down to the floor. When you create a robot to be put to use in many different applications, and torn apart by hackers, there is no reason to create a gripper that is supposed to be the ""end all be all."" It will always be wrong.3-D PrintedThe gripper on Jerry is 3-D printed. Hobbyists and researchers can change the design as needed and have it created quickly. This way a task-specific gripper can be built for any situation.RemovableTo remove the gripper all a person has to do is pull it off and undo the clip to the actuator cable.The modular design makes switching grippers quick and simple. Its like changing the nozzle on a vacuum cleaner.Software is easy to upgrade but, in robotics, hardware also needs to be modifiable. The gripper allows Jerry to be customized to varying circumstances as few other robots have ever made possible for the user.Jerry is propelled by two 24V gear motors. No, he does not balance on those two wheels like a Segway. He simply sits on his two drive wheels and casters. Any other method introduces an unnecessary point of failure and complication, with little benefit.24V Drive Motors and Power SupplyThe motors are powered by a rechargable battery pack which can power Jerry for 2-4 hours under continuous operation. Look in the mirror. How many eyes do you have? Hopefully two. Do you feel your way along with your hands when you walk down a hall. Do you send out a sound and listen to the response to find an object? Do you memorize your house so that you know the exact number of steps to take from one door to another. Not unless you're blind!

 
Stereo-VisionThere is no reason to make robots blind when they have the capability to see the way what we see. Jerry has two 5 megapixel cameras to attain that goal.So that those cameras can ""look around"" they are on an articulated face which enables Jerry to see what he is grasping or about to roll over. The movement of the face also helps with interaction and communication.The great part about vision is that it gets better with computing. All the information needed to interact with the world is in a picture if you know how to get it. It is not just viable in a particular case, it is universally applicable. Other sensors are dead weight when vision is used correctly.

Other SensorsJerry relies primarily on his cameras for perception. But for redundancy, Jerry's arm actuators contain potentiometers in order to read their location, and his drive motors are mounted with magnetic quadrature encoders.Used in Self-Driving CarsIn order to support the amount of data analysis required for a fully vision-based robot we needed a computer that was smarts. The Nvidia Jetson TK1 was chosen to be the main CPU.The Jetson was designed for use in vision and deep-learning applications. Tesla and Google use them in their self-driving car and deep-learning programs. With a computational rate of up to 326 Gigaflops the Jetson is a beast.Linux The Jetson runs a version of Ubuntu and can accept and run software such as ROS and TensorFlow. This makes Jerry an ideal platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence research. And now that research can be done on a robot that will actually be used in the real world by real people.Expandable Sensor CapacityThe microcontroller that takes the commands from the Jetson is the Arduino Mega. The Mega was far more I/O capabilities than many other open source microcontrollers. This capability again makes Jerry a good hobby or research platform. For detailed specs visit the webpage.See what went into making the Jerry prototype.""Your living room is the final frontier for robots.""                                          ~Cynthia Breazeal, CEO of Jibo IncHobby then HomeJerry is ready to be released as a hobby and development platform. But he is meant for so much more than that. With a personal robot that is truly multiuse the obvious extension is to put him into homes. Jerry has the physical capabilities to operate in a house now. But the software needs to catch upThis campaign is to get Jerrys out into the hands of developers and educators who can begin to give us feedback on the design and capabilities and help us grow the software base.SDK and App StoreThe money from this campaign will allow Slant to build the first run of Jerry's and hire several dedicated developers to create the software infrastructure that is needed to start putting Jerry into homes, including an SDK and App Store.Jerry is going to become the world's first true personal robot butler.$5 - Honorary FounderEveryone that contributes $5 or more will be placed on our list of honorary founders displayed proudly on our website.$15 - 3-D printed Walter RobotWalter was the result of a long weekend programming and working on Jerry.

All the microcontroller code will be available for your reference and customization.$1599 - Development Jerry Early BirdBe the first to get a Jerry at a discount of nearly $1000 dollars. This Jerry is a great development platform and will be able to accept all software that is created for the home version. In the meantime you can enjoy Jerry with the basic functionality that he will come with, or just start adding your own when the SDK is released.$1799 - Development JerryLate to the party. No worries. This reward is a full Jerry with basic functionality that you can begin to hack or teach with. And, of course, it will be ready to receive all of our home software when that portion of the project is complete.Basic prizes like T-shirts and Walter's will be delivered within a month of the campaign ending.The headless Jerry will be shipping much sooner than the other versions since it will not be reliant on any software.The Jerry's with the basic beta OS in place and ready for development will be ready in January. From there we will be working with folks to make final tweaks to the SDK which will be released so that people can easily build their own apps.The home version will have the OS fully completed with several tasks pre-programmed, such as clearing a room of random items and monitoring the house. Backers on the waiting list will have first dibs to purchase these units as a reduced price. When the App Store is completed customers will be able to upgrade their software and download new abilities.Gabe Bentz - Founder of Slant I've been building robots since I could walk.

189,"Several months before the release of the video game ""call of duty: black ops 2"" Youtube creator FPSRussia released a video featuring a ""prototype quadrotor"" Me being Both a robotics and Radio control enthusiast was fascinated and in fact fully tricked by this video. Not knowing it was a plug for an upcoming video game I made a concerted effort to share this amazing new ""development"". Even after watching the same video dozens of times with friends I was still fooled. Until that fateful day. Sam-witched between what I believe was a sanitary pad commercial and an add for a (great?) lawyer , was a 30 second cut of a new game to be released. To my horror I got to watch the ""amazing new  tech"" I was blabbering about to all my friends get shot down...quite literally in crisp, ps3 graphics. Great. So while jamming approximately 3/4 of my right foot directly in my mouth, I had time to reflect. Rather than accept da-feet, I could use da-hands, to create.      I quickly realized  the mountain I was about to climb.  using skills I learned working on a break press in a sheet metal shop, and after pouring over the same video,  and hundreds of pictures I drew up blu-prints.  It took the person I had contracted to cut my frame almost 6 months to finally get the parts to me for my frame while at the very last minute critically messing up the arms. I had my frame but my incredibly important and somewhat complex arms were not working out at all. I knew then i was on my own. So over the last two years I have been building up the tools I need and doing work intermittently. Relying on holiday gift money and the occasional splurge to fund a part I needed to continue building it without help. There were times I thought I wouldn't ever finish it. I was building on a timeline of years..not weeks or months, electronics are expensive haha! There were even some people who thought it would never fly. To my great relief and excitement it flew for the first time for approximately 2 minutes Feb 5th 2015. Success! Now for Phase 2. Mark 1 is finished-ish. Apparently it took COD 27 of them to finally perfect theirs. It seems like I am on the right track. Next step is 3D fpv vision and a mission based rail system on the bottom. One of the first things everyone asks me is if im going to put a gun on it. Besides that being an incredibly bad idea, its extremely  illegal. I mulled it over and went through my alternatives. I can make a mock one for regular flight or put an air-soft with a servo. Neither of these I found would give me the effect i was really looking for. So much of my design has been based around the idea that my quad was going to be a functional workhorse. be able to carry a relatively large payload. I thought hard about what people would actually need and expand-ability. I finally decided that an independent fpv paintball turret will be my happy medium. I really wanted to bring my friends and family into this but am unwilling to allow anyone else to fly. Using a paintball gun (in a safe area of course) maximizes visibility to see if you have hit your target and adds a certain level of awesome. Easily removable, and replaced with the next attachment.

194,"Mandibular Movement SimulatorAim of this invention is to mechanically reproduce the jaw movements on a maximum range of precision. Thanks to a mechanical structure simulating the real jaw movement of any patient, it is possible to construct a dental prosthesis of a very high quality, and in a short time because it will be absolutely limited the number of tests applied on the patient as you will have always with you the jaw movement of the patient.The functionThe movement simulator is composed by a metallic structure created for moving the plaster cast of the patient's jaw. This structure strictly coincides with the reference point  taken in the jaw, with 6 axis of motion x,y,z, so that any rotation for every single axis can replaces the movement.How to record the mandibular movementAt present that information is made from a axiograph. My goal will obtain it from some cameras.Replace mandibular  movement.The movement collected data is transferred on a pc, and the pc will give the movement information to the robot. There are two casts of patient’s  jaw (upper and lower): the upper cast is fix, only the lower one will be moved.The idea.One day, in a dental laboratory we got some troubles for the elaboration of a difficult prosthesis in an irritable patient. The best solution would have been to have always with us, at the lab, the mandibular movements of the patient.FutureI think this robot will create a real revolution of a dental technology, because it will draw a new standard of work for this sector. Labs and patients will have a prosthesis on a very lower price, a shorter time, and a higher quality. I am sure we can open a new goal for the community.My strong hope is that you can help me to realize this very useful dental tool. It is my dream, but I am also very confident that we can start new goals for this sector.Many thanks to my friends. I think  I’m very lucky to know these people, they are  excellent technicians and they are ready in any moment to help me for the best technical solutions.Practical use of my robotThe robot can be replace the real jaw movement of any patient as it gets the perfect reproduction of it.To create the best prosthesis at all it is fundamental to get that perfect information: the shape of the teeth depends on the movement of your anatomic structure.Value resultsPerfect reproduction of a chewing cycle.Shorter time for a prosthesis production.Shorter time for try and fitting prosthesis.Lower price to realize it.Enormous advantage for the laboratory as you will have always with you the patient jaw movements.Easy detection of any possible problem of a patient  jaw movement.The  “Posselt space” of movement is replace in this robot and permit to have and look:Centric- RelationMaximum Intercuspal PositionPostural positionResting positionHinge axis movementMaximun ProtrusionMaximum OpeningChewing LoopAll data of the jaw movement ‘ll be replaced.StateHereby you will find a prototype demonstration. We’ll reach the production standard just with some short upgrade and test. I estimate three months of work are sufficient to start up the industrial production of the robot.Some solutions are near to be ready like  the wireless control, may be with your founds we are able to put it in the first sell version.We work also for the second step of this idea, used cameras for record the movement,We can imagine an upgrade of the robot, that you put the two casts of patient’s  jaw in the maximum intercuspal position and the robot automatic move this cast in the correct space position for start the movement, now you need a arbitrary ear-face-bow instrument for realize, this operation  will be realized by robot only with the cinematic image data record without use tools.Time line The range of application for this idea is not limited to the dental sector, we have request from veterinary,speech therapist , ear nose and throat specialist, maxillo-facial surgeon.Italian blog http://simulatoredimovimentimandibolari.blogspot.it/Look the robot at work:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFnO7fs2ehsTwitter:https://twitter.com/MandibularSITALIAN VERSIONScopo della presente invenzione è quello di riprodurre meccanicamente i movimenti della mandibola con la massima di precisione.Grazie ad una struttura meccanica, simulando il reale movimento di ogni paziente, è possibile costruire una protesi dentaria di alta qualità, e in breve tempo perché sarà limitato il numero di prove da effetuare  in oltre si  avrà sempre a disposizione  il movimento del paziente. Come funziona? Il simulatore movimento è costituito da una struttura metallica creata per spostare il calco in gesso dell'arcata inferiore del paziente. Tale struttura coincide precisamente con il punto di riferimento preso nella mandibola, ha 6 assi di movimento x, y, z, e la rotazione sui tre assi permendo il movimento in tutte le direzioni dello spazio. Come registrare il movimento mandibolare?Attualmente  l'informazione è messa a disposizione  da vari strumenti tra cui l’axiografo . Il mio obiettivo sarà di ottenere queste informazioni da telecamere.Riproduzione del movimento mandibolareI dati raccolti vengono trasferiti su un computer, e il computer  fornirà le informazioni di movimento al robot. Dei due calchi della mascella del paziente (superiore e inferiore): il calco superiore sarà  fisso, solo quello inferiore sarà in movimento.L'idea....Un giorno, ero in un  laboratorio odontotecnico con un amico, abbiamo avuto alcuni problemi per la realizzazione di una protesi, il caso era molto difficile.La soluzione migliore sarebbe stata quella di avere sempre con noi, presso il laboratorio, i movimenti mandibolari del paziente.ProspettivePenso che questo robot creerà una vera e propria rivoluzione nella tecnologia dentale, perché disegnerà un nuovo standard di lavoro per il settore. Si costruiranno protesi ad un prezzo prezzo molto più basso, con minor tempo, e una qualità superiore. Sono certo che si aprirà una nuova strada per la comunità.La mia  speranza è di ricevere l'aiuto necessario a realizzare questo strumento dentale. Questo è 'il mio sogno,sono  molto fiducioso che potremmo iniziare a porre nuovi obiettivi per il settore.Devo ringraziare tantissimo i miei amici. Penso di essere stato molto fortunato nel conoscere queste persone, in oltre sono ottimi tecnici e sono pronti in qualsiasi momento ad  aiutarmi suggerendomi le migliori soluzioni.Uso pratico del  robotIl robot può sostituire il movimento reale mascella di qualsiasi paziente riproducendone perfettamente il movimento.Per creare la migliore protesi possibile è fondamentale disporre di informazioni precise sul movimento della bocca: la forma dei denti è modellata dal  movimento di tutta la struttura anatomica della bocca.Alcune considerazioni su cosa può fare:Riproduzione di un ciclo di masticazione.Minor tempo per la produzione di protesiRiduzione dei tempi di prova sul pazientePrezzo più basso per realizzazione delle protesiUn vantaggio enorme, sarà la possibilità di  avere sempre con voi i movimenti della mandibola del paziente.Facile individuazione di eventuali problemi di un movimento della mascella del paziente.Lo spazio di movimento descritto da “Posselt"" sarà visibile nella riproduzione effettuata dal robot.Relazione CentricaMassima posizione intercuspidazionePosizione posturalePosizione di riposoAsse cerniera  movimentoMassima protrusioneMassima aperturaTutti i dati del movimento della mandibola saranno riprodotti. Situazione:Attualmente esiste  un prototipo dimostrativo. Arriveremo allo standard di produzione solo con qualche aggiornamento e test. Stimo tre mesi di lavoro per avviare la produzione industriale del robot, ulteriori tre mesi saranno necessari per adempiere le formalità buracratiche.Alcune soluzioni  tecniche sono vicine alla realizzazione, come il controllo senza fili e  potrebbe accadere che  con i vostri fondi saremo in grado di inserirle nella prima versione di vendita.Lavoriamo anche per la seconda fase di questa idea, telecamere da utilizzate per registrare il movimento.Possiamo immaginare un upgrade del robot, dove si mettano i due calchi della mascella del paziente nella posizione di massima intercuspidazione e il robot con movimento automatico  posizioni correttamente nello spazio il punto di partenza per iniziare il movimento, attualmente è necessario un arco facciale per svolgere tale operazione, il robot farà tutto questo da solo con le informazioni ricavate dalle immagini cinematiche senza utilizzare strumenti.ApplicazioneIl campo di applicazione per questa idea non è limitato al settore dentale, abbiamo richieste in campo veterinario, nella  logopedia , in otorinolaringoiatria , nel maxillo-facciale.Sono molti anni che lavoro a questo progetto è venuto il momento di entrare sul mercato.Con il vostro aiuto io realizzerò un sogno e porrete le basi per nuove frontiere nel campo dentale.Grazie per il vostro aiuto.",Gian Maria,€0,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Fri, August 7 2015 8:29 AM UTC +00:00",Aim of this invention is to mechanically reproduce the jaw movements on a maximum range of precision.

All financial information will be made public along with the names of the people who helped made it happen. I like too in the future ship the boards out for free with motors and battery packs,But I first require the capital made from selling my kits to get the ball rolling, I am hoping to get the price down to 100 kits costing around £250. Exposing as many people as I can to the field of basic electronics, soldering and simple robotics.MY BLOG : http://beambuilder.blogspot.co.uk/Hello there!. My name is Rickey and I would like to tell you about a robotics project which isn't only unique, it requires no programming and no sensors. My robots brain is based on a circuit designed by a guy named Mark Tilden, He is the inventor of a field of robotics called BEAM robotics and is also the designer of toys such as the Robosapian. Below shows a early prototype of the Robosapian, utilising three of these boards for walking.My board is adapted from Marks work and the work of fellow robot hobbyist jwgoerlich, Who has used the boards on the robots displayed on this page. My board is very similar, but is designed to be more user friendly and a more viable version for mass retail. Four boards are shipped as one piece and are pre-cut so they can be easily separated.Parts per board (Supplied in all kits, Times by four for each panel)2N3906 Transistor x2

 1N4148 Diode x4
Red LED x1
 , Yellow LED x1 ,
Green LED x1So what does the board actually do?Well as you can see in the first video, Two of these boards give the robot a unique haptic response. Using nothing more than motor load, The circuit will sense when contact is made with a obstacle and automatically change its direction. After a few seconds themotor will then return to the state it was in before it hit the obstacle.In the second video, When the two arms are out of sync, the robot turns in place. This condition puts extra load on the motors. So after a few tumbles, one of the Abcores will senses that extra load and will then reverse. That arm will then fall back into sync. Moving the robot forward. Using two of these boards means the robot can go forward, back, left and right turn. All with no programming or with no sensors. You can also connect the boards up in a master-slave configuration to create awesome walking robots. These robots will want to seek a state where the least amount of load is put on the motors, which just happens to be when its moving.Circuit Variations

. Headbots. ""Replace the two 4.7K internal resistors with CdS photoresistors for phototropic oscillations (ideal for headbots). No further electronics required.Headbot ""Solder the negitive leads of two IR diodes into L1 and L2, Then solder posirive leads to eachother.No further electronics required.So if your still scratching your head, Don't worry about the jargon, The boards have been designed to be user friendly. All the components are through hole, easily soldered, the board is masked, covering the tracks on the board, meaning the only thing your solder is going to stick to is the well spaced pads and the component your trying to soldering in. All the components, values and there polarity are displayed right there on the board.A simple tutorial will also be sent of the different things you can do with the boards. You can also experiment with different ways of connecting each module. These boards are for building interesting robots quickly and cheaply.So what will I need that doesn't come with the kit?.1) Soldering Iron (Why not check out if your school has one of these)2) Solder3) Plastic/wire to build robot body and legs.4) Battery pack or solar panel - 3/5v5) Motors, these boards are designed to work with DC motors, but work best with the geared variety shown below, these can be picked up from sites like aliexpress for as low as 80 pence a piece.

207,"I found this old city in Italy for sale that needs help.  I figured why not buy it out restore the buildings and bring this 11th century town into the 21st century.  Perhaps the first written document mentioning Valle Piola dates back to the year 1059. Early records show that the area surrounding Valle Piola, along with the adjoining lands of Monti della Laga enjoyed a semi-autonomous status. Such rights have been codified in the form of statutes bestowing upon Valle Piola the recognition of being a ""rural comune"" (rural commune).

In the years following 1152 the mountain areas of the region lost population as people made their way to the much larger provincial capital of Teramo. These migrations were at times involuntary in nature. One well known family from Teramo, the De Valle's, likely originated from Valle Piola, possibly from Case Menghini.

Because of its isolated nature, the people of Valle Piola were by necessity very self-sufficient. Since it took several long hours by foot or mule to reach the nearest good sized town, Teramo, they also had to be well organized and prepared for the hardships they faced, especially those encountered in the long, cold winter months. Virtually every house int the village had an adjacent animal stall which used to shelter the family cows, steers, pigs, and horses. Also present was a small garden for the cultivation of potatoes and other vegetables. Stone walls, now completely in ruins, at one time helped to form terraces on the hilly slopes surrounding the houses.

Many of the people from Valle Piola were illiterate and spoke a Lombardic dialect which was virtually incomprehensible to residents of the neighboring villages. Historically, the most educated and cultured resident was the local priest. More recently, the school master would also have fit this description.

From the 13th century until the time of the Italian Risorgimento (unification), Valle Piola served as a meeting center and hideout for armed brigands who made this area their home, this area being ideally suited for such purposes. These groups demanded total loyalty to their cause thus leading both to squabbles amongst the various brigand factions as well as to clashes with the sovereign forces whose task was to uphold the law. They encountered at best mixed success in their attempts to subdue and pacify the openly rebellious subversive outlaw clans. At times these internecine battles took on characteristics of a civil war.

During the Second World War the Italian resistance fighters staged in this area, along with Bosco Martese and other nearby forest tracts of Monti della Laga in their struggles against the occupying German forces.

In present times the area surrounding Valle Piola is used mainly for the grazing of livestock. In the summer months a herdsman watches over the animals day and night and a shelter for protection from the elements has recently been constructed.The goal is bring an economy back into the city.  To have residents,jobs and maybe even an Apple store..  ",Albert Landwehr,$0,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Fri, June 12 2015 9:57 PM UTC +00:00",I want this city to advance the future in an old world city. and to breathe new life into it.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,0, ,0,"$5,000,000",Buy Valle Piola by Albert Landwehr — Kickstarter
208," Artificial Neural Networks are simulated brain neurons. They can be used for pattern recognition in complex data structures, and are the future of machine learning and Artificially Intelligent systems. Currently Nnets are used for: voice recognition, bionics, computer vision, text recognition ect.. 
Nnets are an interconnected information processing structure, with x # of inputs, y # of outputs and z # of hidden layers. There are many forms of neural networks, and each one has different learning rules. You can also use multiple nnets in the same program each for a specialized function. This vastly increases the intelligence of the simulation. MolaromZX is a multiple neural network, programmed for speech output/ User Interaction.  The main function of the simulation is to create and communicate with simulated identities,
The program overtime gains a higher expertise in communication, and problem solving.
The neural nets processing is scaled based on the hardware, by changing the number field. The nodes of the multiple neural network are interconnected with each neural net having a unique and distinct function.

South Wales Australia. I graduated with a degree in Computer 
Science (specialized in Robotics). Robotics is my passion and I have attained ample amount of 
experience in it. I have invented new technologies & methods for Robots (Patent under process) and also in 
the other aspects
of technology. My friend who works for the Tiger Saving Committee in India got in touch with me and explained me the situation of the tigers why there is a need for innovation.This committee works hand in hand with the Forest Department of India. These Forest officials are responsible for taking care of the wildlife & the forests 
in
India. Their main worry at the moment (and has been for a while) is the 
wild
tigers. The tigers are soon to be extinct. The Tigers are at the top of the food chain and when they start to decline, It means that whole ecosystem is in trouble.Tiger -> Deer -> Plants
After a lot of research and an inspiring chat with the people
involved with Tiger Saving Committees in India, I found it really challenging when
they mentioned that we need some way to do the following:

·TO OBSERVE THE LIFESTYLE OF THE TIGER· FIND ITS USUAL PATH IN THE FOREST·FIND OUT THE ISSUES FACED BY THE TIGER IN THE FOREST·SAVE THE TIGERS  They have already experimented technologies such as a Radio collar, Infrared Sensor enabled camera’s that
activates when it senses motion. But their trouble is that they have
not been able to achieve the desired results. So they felt a need for a better
technology to achieve the above mentioned motives to be able to save/help the tigers. Whilst conversing with them an Idea of creating a robot clicked into my mind that could follow the tiger as a constant companion & is well equipped with high tech cameras, laser scanner/sensors, motion sensor, is solar chargeable and communicates using radio waves.Following the tiger on the ground whilst it’s walking in it's normal speed is
probably a better idea than a drone. I have created a design & have featured the robot in way, which would allow
the robot to be in the forest around the animals with minimal issues.The Computer Aided
Models, a cardboard prototype, animated movement of the robot and the required hardware is as follows:Past Research shows that a six-legged robots have been successful in running, leaping, climbing and avoiding obstacles bigger than itself, which makes this design a perfect design to handle extreme conditions that are in the forest.Each and every project in
this world at some stage requires funds to procure external hardware, internal
system, research work, technical expertise & labor. More the funds more can
be achieved with the project. For this project the estimated costs that would occur in the early stages of this project would be :Sensors & Cameras   $2500(max)Main Computer   $1500(max)Solar Cells $600(appx)Custom Made Batteries 12V 240 Ah $1500(max)Robot System Structure $600 (max)Other smaller components Rent a room to form into a lab $600 pm * 6 = $3600Hire 3 workers to work on hardware, software & electronics $500 * 3 * 6 = $9000Research workTesting along the wayConstant trips from city to the Forest and vice-verse.There are a lot of recurring costs that would occur during the process of creating this robot due the complexities that we will face inside the forest which I haven't considered yet. One of the complexities on top of my head is to discover and implement some sort of communication to transfer real time data from the robot back to base. The second stage of this project will be adding the ability of flying to the robot. The proposed amount that i want to be pledged is the bare minimum amount that would be required to bring this robot to life.For this specific project we all need to unite,
we need the wild lovers & innovation freaks. People who wish to catch a sight of a real
tiger and would want their next generation to be able to do the same. This is
not an individual project, it’s the whole world’s project, let’s save the
tigers, fight through this life challenge and win over it to save those who
need us..Everybody in this game is a player, there is no audience, I will
do both research and development involved with this robot but I need everybody
to provide their support with the funds, ideas, comments, feedback and
technical help. This
 project currently is only on paper with basic research completed. So 
the required funding is to start the initial process of buying the 
required components(and starting the initial development process & 
awaiting for the components to arrive) then going ahead and hiring 
people to work along with me. Then starts the real work of development 
& building of the robot with testing along the way & research

Behind the pilots seat, there (still deciding) might be another seat for a passenger. The passenger will not have any controls. The cockpit will be in the upper-body portion of the mech.Arms: Above is a drawing of a robotic arm, ours will not be nearly this advanced but it's an idea we will be going off of. We will have two joints, the shoulder and part before-elbow, and the part after the elbow, the elbow will bend, and there will be multiple attachments for hands. These arms will be able to move independently through each joystick in the cockpit.Engine and other necessary parts: The engine and other necessary parts will be located under the cockpit, or above/behind it. 

 How it will start, how will people enter/exit: It will start via a key most likely. There are future plans for Bluetooth starting from your smartphone/smart watch also. This is not likely on the first model though.

Extra features: There will be multiple attachments to the hands which are still open to ideas, but other than that inside the cockpit there will be a circuit board with many buttons (simple buttons) that will have features such as:

Microphone/Speaker: You will be able to talk and project your voice outside the mech.-Lights:There will be lights you can turn on/off outside the mech

-Killswitch: Just incase

-More to be decided.What will we do after the first one is built?We will through the process of building it, write down our steps, and we hope to commercially produce these. We will be selling them for little-no profit as we just think this is a massively fun thing to do, they will be sold world-wide, to every country we can ship them to. (Shipping prices WILL Vary). Our plan:Our plan is to first buy tracks cheap from a broken ""Caterpillar"", and will build from there. We know several scrap metal dealers around us where we will buy/salvage metal from to build. Once the lets are finished, we will work on the cockpit, and then arms. We will be using hydraulics to control arms. We have found a programmer to help with any coding needed also, we ask Kickstarter to help us fund this so we can afford parts quicker, and higher quality parts. During construction of the project, everything will be extremely documented so it can be reproduced, and we will make more for sale to the public. We are debating releasing construction plans to the public also.How we will spend the money:We will spend money we receive largely on buying circuitry, a laptop to run the mech, metal we will need, rubber tracks. All the money we get will go into the mech, we will also spend $3,000 on advertising to get more people knowledgeable about the project. There will be no left-over funds after the Kickstarter, and we will still be going into our own pockets for a lot of this project. We just ask Kickstarter to help, so we can make the machine of our, and your dreams!Thank you for looking at, and/or backing our KickStarter.

216,"In the US and around the world, everyday people are sent into pipes to inspect, clean and coat. These pipes can range in diameter from 32 inches to 144+inches. Many of these pipes are partially flooded with sewage or other types of waste. They can spend weeks working in this confined, hazardous environment. Then they get to move onto their next job!The AWWA estimates over $1.2 Trillion to repair our current infrastructure. Why would we do this work with people underground? We have found that Philadelphia has over 3,000 miles of sewer pipe while San Diego has over 300 miles of large diameter pipe. Every large city inherently has large diameter sewer, fresh water, and storm water pipes. Working with the support of our friends and family, without pay, we have been able to put together a functional initial prototype. This modular robot is capable of cleaning, inspecting and coating pipes ranging in diameter from 72 inches to 102 inches. We have several utilities that would like to use our technology but we need a boost of money to help us wrap up the mechanics and electronics of the robot and put together the rest of the system!WE'RE SO CLOSE!

219,"RoboJoe is a 100% automated coffee shop, meaning that we have taken all of the functions of a regular retail coffee business, and condensed it down into a 4'x4'x7' building. This ""building"", run by our robo-barista Joe, is able to grind, brew, and personalize your coffee in about sixty seconds. Scroll down a bit to see a step-by-step demonstration of our process.We created RoboJoe in order to streamline the coffee making process, and provide a smaller and more efficient version of an everyday coffee shop. Along the way, though, we also discovered a better way to make coffee, by removing the bitters, and providing a smooth and flavorful cup, unlike any coffee you've ever experienced. That's the real question, isn't it? Why RoboJoe Coffee? We all have our favorites; our coffee loyalties are already assigned, a specific flavor or brew is our hook in the morning, so why make the switch to RoboJoe? Well, we're a bit biased, but we can tell you that it's a different cup of coffee, and the only way to answer that question is to come out and try it for yourself. With no bitters, a different flavor experience, and a fresh grind and brew, you'd be surprised at the difference between RoboJoe coffee and other retail and gas station type coffees. It's smooth but strong, and delivers the morning caffeine kick without the afternoon stomach upset, and there's no opportunity for allergens to sneak in, or for your order to be wrong and ruin your day. That's what this Kickstarter is all about; we want to hear why you love RoboJoe coffee, we want to bring you on board our obsession and see to it that we bring you into our new coffee circle. We want you to come and meet your new cup o'Joe, and tell us why this new cup will be your forever cup.  As you can see in the video above, we've rendered a CAD video of the RoboJoe process to give you a better idea of how the machine will function once completed. Once RoboJoe receives an order through our app, he picks up a cup, adds the milk and sugar, then caps the cup off with a lid. From there he adds your choice of InBru flavoring and proceeds to bring the cup to the brewing station. Once in the station, the machine grinds and brews a fresh cup of coffee. Once the brewing is complete, Joe seals the lid, and passes the coffee to the rightful customer, based on the scan of the confirmation number on the app. This is perhaps the most important part of this campaign; letting you know where we are at with the development process, and what we are aiming to do with this Kickstarter. We are on a two-month track for finished development following the completion of this Kickstarter campaign, meaning that we will have the RoboJoe prototype ready for consumer testing. This does not mean that we will have a perfect machine, a set brand, and awesome marketing materials that will blow your mind. We're small, that's the truth, and we've started this campaign because we need your help. We need the funds to complete our prototype and to host a launch event (or two) in order to get your feedback. We're looking for proof of concept, meaning we want to hear what you have to say. Do you like the logo? Do you like the coffee? Do you feel excited, happy, emotionally overwhelmed, so on and so forth? We wish we could show you pictures of our prototype right now, but due to pending patents, we are unable to do as such. We will be posting updates as soon as we are able, in the updates section.Once we get to launch at USM, we'll be able to bring RoboJoe to other states, and meet new people! So please contribute today so we can bring RoboJoe to Maine, and eventually to other places!PersonalizationYour coffee should taste just the way you like it: fresh and flavorful. We chose Inbru over traditional coffee flavoring because Inbru is brewed along with the coffee in our brew station. The secret is in their organic rice hulls. They flavor them perfectly using a patented method, so you can flavor your coffee any way you'd like. Best of all, they do it without adding any sugar, calories, fat, gluten or carbs. Where syrups come out sticky and contain mystery ingredients like milk, InBru is safe and easy to incorporate into a cup of coffee. We like to mix and match Inbru’s 20 flavors, with the opportunity to combine up to two, that's 400 different flavor combinations. This allows you to create unique tastes like Cinnamon Blueberry Muffin, and Chocolate-Caramel Nut, and choose a flavor that is just your own. Check them out at inbru.com. RoboJoe Mobile Ordering AppMobile ordering is the new rage for smartphone apps - and RoboJoe wasn't going to miss out on the change in the tides. The only way to order your RoboJoe coffee is through our app, which can be downloaded for free from both the Google Play Store and the Apple Store. You can store your credit card information on our secure app and even save your favorite flavor combinations, in order to create a one-click process when ordering coffee. As you can see below, you create an account to order RoboJoe coffee, then, once you're in, your many options await you!  Your first option will be size - starting out we offer a 12-ounce or a 16-ounce hot coffee, but we will expand into different sizes, and even iced coffee and specialty espresso drinks.Your next option will be the strength. We know consumers have different preferences to how you like your coffee; whether you like it strong enough to stand a spoon up in, or weak enough to be considered tea, we've got you covered.  Once you've got the preliminary choices out of the way, you can personalize the flavors of your coffee like we mentioned above under the ""InBru Benefit"".Once you've chosen your flavors, you can choose your type of milk and sugar, along with the amount. We think that RoboJoe coffee has such a smooth, strong flavor, that we drink our coffee black, and we recommend you give it a try first before you add anything else. But, should you decide that you'd love more in your coffee, not a problem. Our prototype will feature milk and cream, but in the future, we will be offering dairy alternatives, like almond milk.  Once your coffee is perfectly designed, you just press the 'done' button, enter in your credit card information, and the app sends your order directly to RoboJoe. Within only one minute, your coffee will be hot and ready. Just scan your confirmation number at the machine, and you (and you alone!) can pick up your cup. AutomationOne of the biggest benefits of RoboJoe is that automation has allowed us to significantly decrease the footprint of a regular coffee shop. With everything minimized, the shop is able to fit in many different places. RoboJoe can replace the coffee buffets at gas stations, allowing people to order while filling up their car, or waiting for a pizza.Additionally, RoboJoe can fit anywhere where there is a high population and a high demand for coffee. The following areas are our top 10 - where we think RoboJoe would be most effective initially. As you can see below, we have a fairly compact timeline over the next couple of months. Once the campaign is launched, we've set a 30-day time limit for contributions. On March 1st, we begin our final steps towards completing the RoboJoe prototype, for preparation for a launch event.The date and time of the launch event is still TBD, but we are aiming for the first week of May, at the University of Southern Maine. Please stay tuned in the 'Updates' section of this campaign for exact times and dates. Check out the rewards to the right for more in-depth descriptions of each of the rewards. We will ship them in April so that you can wear your t-shirt to our launch events!Our StoryWe're based out of Southern Maine, and our family business is making robots. With Dan and Luke handling the awesome 'technical-robotics-invention' side of things, Alex handles the creative branding, marketing, and people side. We believe in what we're doing, we're excited to be introducing a new and innovative solution, and with Dan and Luke being super-nerds about robots and technology, that leaves Alex the coffee-chugging champion of the project. We're happy to finally be getting our idea out there, and we're so excited for everyone to come by and meet their new cup o' Joe. ",Alexandra Johnson,$175,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sun, March 13 2016 6:54 PM UTC +00:00","RoboJoe is designed to produce a bitter-free coffee experience, using automation to condense a full shop into a minimal footprint.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,3, ,0,"$13,000",RoboJoe (prototype) - a robotic coffee shop! by Alexandra Johnson — Kickstarter

Our reason to start this project was simple: to provide a cheap but efficient method to make agriculture easier.Without going 100% technical, it goes something like this: we use a combination of individual sensors and smartphone sensors to analyze the environment and use that information to successfully provide instructions for the robot's navigation.The Agribot has multiple functionalities. For example, it can be controlled by joystick or motion control sensor from our app. It is compass and gyro stabilized and can work in tightly confined crop rows or even indoors. It even has a universal platform and can mount different equipment and work in different environments.

224,"Hello! Thank you for viewing my project!To start off, I have been building robots since 9th grade so roughly 6 years now. I enjoy building robots, wiring them, and then programming them. It is a hobby of mine. I have built many robots and other engineering projects since then and compiled all of them to a website that you can view here:  http://www.frankmagazu.com/   So for this project I am attempting to make a large autonomous rover that can be controlled and monitored over 4G LTE as well being given instructions to operate autonomously with GPS over a planned course. The rover will be hybrid running on battery or with a small gas generator with a vast amount of sensors to both control itself autonomously and to monitor it's environment. Below are a list of objectives/abilities the rover will have. 1) controllable over short range radio or over 4G-LTE2) powered by battery and optionally a small gas generator for long journeys 3) 2 jointed arm that is roughly 8 feet in length with a high powered gripper (rough sketch below) 4) short range ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles when moving autonomously 5) Computer vision system to detect objects for the arm to grab as well as detecting edges for autonomously navigating sidewalks and other surfaces6) various auxiliary functions, headlights, ability to speak English to people, ability to collect and spray water if programmed to, sirens, and possibly other lights.7) short range wireless camera/audio as well as camera/audio over 4G-LTE8) tons of sensors for data collection and autonomous navigation assistance including but not limited to, light sensors, spectrometer, radar, gas sensors (carbon monoxide, methane, etc), electronic compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature sensors, pressure sensors, humidity sensors, wind sensors, UV light sensor, metal detecting sensor, and for more internal sensors encoders, voltage, current, and force sensors9) Potentially will add a core sample drill to dig holes for soil analysis or for metal detecting objects and retrieving them, or even for automated seed planting10) Ability to navigate a plotted course of land and record a desired attribute and map it, for example going over a field while recording if there is metal or not resulting in a map of pipes, wires, or even to locate metallic items. 11) water resistant (be able to withstand moderate to heavy rain) 12) perhaps the most important aspect is to be able to program new functions on this rover therefore making it adaptable. This is the arm sketch. When not in use the arm folds on top of the rover (shown in red) to save space. Each shade of blue represents a part of the arm with the dots showing roughly the range of motion it should have. This is a simple video showing the motor turning the front 2 wheelsAs a college student it is difficult to raise funds to complete this kind of project.

226,"The LadyBug is designed to be a constant companion for kids with autism spectrum disorders who have difficulty adapting to our often confusing world. The small robot uses proximity sensors to create interactions that are familiar to both robots and humans with the child. A microprocessor analyzes every situation and responds to the behavior and position of the child, reacting to the child’s actions.For example, if the LadyBug is approached by a child from the front and gently, it will react by smiling and showing a variety of colors on its display. If, however, the LadyBug is approached from the back or aggressively, it will demonstrate a sad face and run away. Tthis teaches children with autism spectrum disorders to interact with other people and children by observing its cyber companion's patterned reactions. The Ladybug is also programmed to teach children to count, speak basic words and phrases, and display a variety of basic human emotions. It's great for kids who are just shy too. Robots don't judge.It all started when two engineers from the city of Niš in Serbia and their economist friend serendipitously met an autism expert at a robotics conference in Germany in 2014. Marko Zivkovic, Uros Smiljanic and Milica Arsic were immediately in awe of the lack of technologically advanced products being created and offered to the general public for children with autism spectrum disorders.Marko and Uros began working on solutions after working their full-time jobs, while Milica devoted whatever free time she had to researching autism spectrum disorders and the medical technology market. (Milica still owes her fiancee big time for this, so a shout out to him for putting up with all of us!)By late 2014, they were joined by an enthusiastic team of 12 people who volunteered their time and expertise to help create the first LadyBug prototype. In 2015, the UTB Tech team began working with the biggest autism clinic in Serbia, Dr Selakovic Clinic, and with the School of Electronic Engineering of the University of Niš, both of which decided to support us during research, development and testing. We've taken the LadyBug through several development phases and we have the final design, hardware specifications, hardware parts providers, and software, and we are ready to manufacture.  The LadyBug cyber companion for children with autism spectrum disorders features: Software features of the first LadyBug model include: The first market-ready model we are building, a limited series of only 100, will have a sleek yet safe, child-friendly, modern design and software to gather data and learn to interact with the child it plays with. The LadyBug doesn't just teach, it learns from the child it spends time with too. It's a rational best friend, not a toy. And it costs 1/3 of the price of the average robots and assistants used in working with children with autism spectrum disorders.We're a group of young engineers and entrepreneurs dedicated to making a change, whose goal is to enhance the social impact that technology has, or should have, in the 21st century. Uros Smiljanic and Marko ZivkovicUros and Marko are more than just the founders of UTB Tech and the tech leads on the LadyBug project.

The system is adapted of 3 main systems, that capable of functioning of manually and automatically up and downloading, transporting and stocking baggage/parcel from one location to the other location(s). These systems are comprises of:

1. A Baggage Transport Vehicle comprises robot, conveyor, laser measurement and optical reader is capable to up and download baggage/parcel from one location to the other location(s) and to recognize the baggage/parcel’s size and shape. 2. A Baggage Transport Cart to transfer any number of the baggage/parcel capable of navigating from one location(s) to the other location(s) manually or automatically or pulled by baggage transport vehicle. 3. A control room to remotely control, and monitor RHS and Baggage Transport Cart.  How RHS provides the most efficient baggage tracking and management. The result of the four years RHS design is demonstrated in the above video clip. The prototype in this video clip is designed by of RHS engineering team. It is very similar to what we will developing in real size. To test the market, we contacted one of the major airlines to get their level of interest and feedback on RHS. 

They showed their interest to see the real working prototype. Since the cost of the real working prototype is beyond of our budget, we need fund to build a prototype based on the small scaled prototype shown in the video clip.

But nobody came to clean the tray and therefore in the six months Serg spent at the hospital the apartment turned into one large latrine. The droppings lay even on the shelves and cabinets. And when he returned home, the apartment stunk so much that it was impossible to live in it. The stagnant smell of cat urine stayed in the house for many more months. 
 
 And then Serg began to think how to get out of this seemingly difficult situation. Yes, the world has already seen attempts to solve the problem of cat and dog toilets using technological means. However, all of these proved unsuccessful, because all these devices
 :

 1. absolutely do not serve as a fully functioning device and require obligatory human intervention at the final stage of cleaning and waste disposal
 

 2. require mandatory application and loading of litter pellets or other consumables
 

 3. require complex, sometimes technically impossible connections to water or sewerage pipes
 

 4. are not full (complete) cycle devices
 

 5. are cumbersome and take up a lot of space

 6. are noisy 
 

 7. are often intuitively incomprehensible or repel animals
 
  8. and, as regards the time spent at the cat tray and the money spent on buying the litter, you simply pour down the toilet day after day.  According to statistics, a person spends two years of their life in the toilet. And now add one more year spent next to the cat tray.... I am sure you can find a better use for it. Well what happened next:) Serg designed, patented, built and tested a universal full-cycle robot toilet for pets, which:  1. completely self-contained and requires no human involvement at any stage of cleaning 2. intuitively understandable for animals 3. does not require purchase, delivery and subsequent disposal of pellets or other consumables 4. completely eliminates unpleasant odours from animal waste at home 5. does not require a fixed connection to the water mains and sewerage 6. is synced with all brands of toilet bowls manufactured worldwide. Including your home toilet. A small tuning and adjusting of the toilet tank makes it a fully functional device  7. saves up to 10,000 euros for the owners during the cat’s lifetime  8. also works for your next kitten 9. allows you to quietly leave on vacation, visit, business trip, leaving your animal alone in the apartment without any problems 10. gives you the opportunity to buy a kitten for yourself or your children We need funding for launching the mass production in the amount of 250,000 euros required for the industrial production of the new device.

SimAI is the ideal command and control of mobile ground robotics, especially on a hostile off planet landscape. SimAI will evolve to a singularity in combination with other AI paths. Simulation Based AI will loop feedback between a real world operation and the simulation of that environment, to enable decision making and evolution of the simulation accuracy and the systems and the machines, it operates.
 Computers will reach true potential as a physical entity instead of a “self aware” ego.  By further iterative process, the simulation becomes the laboratory for evolving the robots and the systems it operates.  SimAI will become a laboratory for evolving all systems.  A universe machine and an evolution machine.  This is the playground for all singularity level AI.  A high level decision making machine needs a laboratory to duplicate real world behaviors.  Loop that over and over into millennia.  Singularity AI might be narrow and stupid as hell – the perfect tool.  This will evolve to installing closed ecosystems off-planet.  And if it can do that, then it can scrub Earth's atmosphere, oceans, terraform Mars, save Earth, and terraform dead exoplanets......SimAI Way-points – milestones overlooked/underdeveloped in humanity's efforts to evolve mass systems.Closed ecosystems are the grail.

my RoBattlebots. RoBattleBots are voice controlled robots, linked together by sensors and battle. RoBattleBots are controlled by a voice/manual controller. Each RoBattleBot is designed with voice recognition technology. With this, the programmed voice will be the only voice capable of operating the RoBattleBot.They will follow any command given; left, right, punch, kick, swing, jump, turn, duck, etc. Also, each RoBattleBot is equipped with its own individual armor and weaponry.  I
have over two hundred designs including body parts, armor, and weaponry ready
to prototype. Not only will children find Robattlebots fascinating and
entertaining, but it will teach strategic knowledge. Adults will
also gravitate toward this new boundless advancement in robotics and
technology. Be the first to invest in our future. Technology has no limit! Updates with videos and pictures coming soon.This is just the beginning! There will be different categories that each Robattlebot falls under. You will have your strength category where the bot will be able to take more hits than others. You have your bots that fall under the speed category where they are fast and agile. You have your mobile group where they move by tracked wheels. Every Robattlebot can be customized to fit your competition need. If you need to be faster then use less armor. If you need power you can choose a more powerful weapon.

239,"Start training right with the NetKnight™ - a high-quality smartphone-controlled HOCKEY shooter tutor that allows players of all ages to practice in their driveway or on the ice. It's great for any player that wants to fine-tune their skills from beginner to expert. Using a SMARTPHONE, the user can control how quickly the opening changes and even hold one spot open for as long as they want. This forces the shooter to always keep their eyes up while shooting, just like they need to in a game. This is a great tool/toy that allows everyone to have FUN while training.Patent Pending THE STORY  When I was a kid I always wanted a “ROBOTIC” goalie so I could perfect my scoring ability and have fun doing it. I had a standard shooter tutor tarp but after a few hundred shots it starting getting easy because I would predetermine what hole to shoot at and adjust my body and stick accordingly. Even after perfecting my ability to score on a stationary tarp, I still only scored a low percentage of my shots in a game. As an adult, I decided to design and build the piece of equipment that was missing from my hockey training as a child. The NetKnight™ is a robust, dynamic shooting system that will allow players of all ages to have fun while improving their skills.  Color Voting for Plastic Panels:Black  -  Red  -  WhiteAll backers will get to vote on the final panel color. They are shown in white but they could be made in Black, Red or White.  NetKnight™ Details     We want you to have the highest quality product possible. Here are the component specifications:- Ballistic Nylon Shell: 2 Ballistic Nylon tarps house the moving internal components.- High-Density Plastic Components: Made out of similar material to actual hockey boards, these components are built to last.  - Bluetooth Circuit Card: Allows you to control the system from your smartphone. Choose between continuous, random or manual mode to customize your training experience. At TOP speed, all five panels will open and close once every 5 seconds. The app allows parents to change the speed of the motor so younger players can learn at their OWN PACE.- Cam Lock Straps: Quick-release allows you to attach the system to a goal while the Zamboni is cleaning the ice. - High-Strength Mounting Hardware - Power: AA batteries or standard wall outlet. Using 8-AA batteries, the NetKnight™ lasts for 3-6+ hours depending on the mode selected, so you’ll have plenty of juice if you use the NetKnight™ during practice or a pick-up game. If you’re training in your driveway or basement, you can plug in to a standard wall outlet. Software/Hardware IntegrationIn the video, we are controlling the NetKnight™ from a smartphone via Bluetooth. See our prototype gallery for an explicit demo using our CUSTOM app to control the system.   What's next?   We want you to have your NetKnight™ by November 2017. Here’s the plan: May: Make lots of new Kickstarter friends to help bring the NetKnight™ to life.  June: Finalize the design details with the manufacturers. July/August: Build tooling for injection molds (14 molds) and place bulk orders for each component (ballistic nylon tarps, molded parts, Bluetooth circuit card, power adapters, battery cases, nuts, and bolts).September: Verify quality of the bulk ordered components by subjecting components to stress tests and, of course, shooting pucks at them!  October: Give suppliers the go ahead to produce large quantities of each component. November: Begin shipping orders to our earliest backers. We GREATLY appreciate YOUR support.Hockey Puck Stress Ball Reward Any pledge amount gets us closer to our goal of bringing the NetKnight™ to life.

245,"Since our founding our mission is to bring robots to the masses. We believe that robots and humans can live and work in harmony together. That’s why we made Luna. Luna is a personal robot designed for everyday practical use. She is a powerful platform capable of an increasing universe of apps and services through an app store model. Human scale with a powerful computer, hi def camera, capacitive touch screen LCD and many other features, Luna is the first evolutionary step in a near-future where robots become a normal part of everyday human life. The Apps, Services and Accessories model has already proven incredibly successful with other platforms like PCs, Mobiles, and Tablets. The creation of Apps, Services and Accessories around an open robotic architecture therefore, is the critical ingredient for the success of robotics as a whole - something that has eluded robotics over the past 50 years, and the reason we don’t have robots in our everyday lives today. Aside being a powerful personal robot, Luna is specifically designed as an Open, Standard, and Affordable platform that inspires and incentivizes developers, entrepreneurs, and visionaries to form a thriving ecosystem. Our success ensures ever more capable robot hardware, with better software and services, from a diverse field of market participants. In short, our success means we have created a robotics industry! Luna is capable of a huge variety of tasks and services, limited only by your imagination. Luna can keep an eye out on the Elderly living on their own and help them to remain independent. Luna can be an invaluable Medical Assistant, reminding patients to take their medicine, assist nurses by fetching items or carrying things from room to room, or facilitate bringing a Specialist to a patient’s bedside (telepresence) for urgent medical care. Luna can patrol a premise and provide security services. For example she can record suspicious activities while informing authorities, allowing humans to stay out of dangerous situations but still provide them the tools they need to confront them. In fact, Luna can do all these things (and more) simultaneously or as needed, since each of these services are essentially apps that are running on the Luna platform and can be obtained through her app store. There are literally an unlimited number of things Luna can do. The question to ask is this: what apps and services will you create on a human size computing platform loaded with sensors and actuators, capable of autonomous mobility?Our philosophy is that the best approach to awesome personal robots is an Open Architecture, using Open Source software, in the hands of visionaries and developers who will passionately innovate. That’s why we’ve started this Kickstarter campaign which will get Luna into production and allows us to put actual Luna hardware into your hands. You can start developing your apps and services a full year before Luna becomes widely available to the public - at which time we expect many of your apps, services and accessories to be available through the Luna app store when we launch. We are excited to offer our Kickstarter supporters an awesome deal: Reserve your Luna for only $999.A beautifully refined design, with a familiar and open architecture, at a price everyone can afford, makes for a robot with mass appeal. Your apps and services will make Luna endlessly useful, which leads to an ever-growing install base of robots. We’ve packed a lot of useful features in Luna for you to bring your vision into fruition:We designed Luna to provide an Open hardware and software architecture that is already familiar to everyone. With a Mini-ITX motherboard and other off-the-shelf hardware, plus the Linux operating system and the ROS library, Luna is an already-familiar and Open space for anyone who can write code. Add WiFi, a bunch of USB ports across her body, camera microphone speakers and a touchscreen LCD, and you have a robot that can be easily programmed, managed, and upgraded... using your existing favorite tools and devices you already own or can easily find.

But there doesn't seem to be a solution for people who wake up to a foot of snow and thus can't back out of the garage! The actual concept is simple, create a snowblower that automatically clears your driveway!The planned design will include a self-charging snowblower that is placed at the top of your driveway. When it detects snow accumulation, either by on-board sensors or by connecting to wi-fi and looking up the weather, it will automatically deploy to clear your driveway. Additionally, you will be able to set a scheduled complete time. This way, your driveway is clear by the time you need to leave for work in the morning! This option would require the snowblower is run once without a time constraint to map out your driveway.While all of these are preferred design components, please understand that we are a group of college students, with limited funds and limited resources. Your donation helps a group of students get an A+ in their class, increasing the knowledge of future generations. It does not guarantee that we will have a working product at the end of the semester.Please additionally understand that we currently have no outlets the will bring this design to the market, and we will not be able to deliver prototypes.

252,"Exactly, what is PODBOT?First of all, you need to think to a robot, after a computer server, but don't forget the portable devices, like iPad, iPhone (or others). Simply create a picture about all of them. The result is the PODBOT.PODBOT is a self-moving BOT, portable device manager, intelligent computer server, which operates the most secure micro social network over the world. Simply communicates with other portable devices, desktop computers, cars, other devices, tools and platforms via own wireless network, internet and/or satellites, while defends all information, data against hackers and/or third (unauthorised) parties.PODBOT accommodates portable devices, protects, cares, deploys (charges their batteries, saves their data from and uploads information onto) them, i.e. inside the body and via wireless network (when they are outside of the body).
For example, your device (iPad, iPhone or other tablet, smartphone) is in use by you, while it’s drained, then PODBOT will serves you by accommodates the empty device and gives another (fully charged one) to your hand; and you can continue your work at the point where you left. (It’s possible, because PODBOT continuously monitors, saves all connected devices’ data, information, and could to upload the data, information to another accommodated device.)Serves all human needs related to IT and portable device usage, manages, deploys, controls, supervises, oversees, cares with them, while protects all information, data (data and information transfer and storage).PODBOT could to serve lot of connected displays (via wireless network) and lot of users (with different permissions), thus PODBOT can be working as a central computer server as well, don’t need to use another desktop computer, because PODBOT can do everything. Don’t use thousands of desktop computers, when one can do all tasks.PODBOT is a multifunctional, intelligent Bot who can serves human and institutional demands, for example: educational needs.

It satisfies future demands related to portable device usage; it's a missing item-supplier, satisfactory device; which has future development options.More information: www.podbot.co.ukThis device accommodates, manages portable devices thus it could to be charging their batteries, engages with desktop computers while solves their deployment, i.e. their software care (update, data transfer, backups, and special software tasks). When a human uses portable device then PODBOT engages with and helps to protect the data and information, keeps them in safe, working as an intelligent core server. But, PODBOT is different. It moves, serves, guards, accommodates. 

Its dissimilitude comes from its capabilities. The main discriminatory facility is: PODBOT could to decide and to move alone.The following pictures introduce these virtues.1:2:3:4:5:6:7:PODBOT's software are ideal for congested institutions which are working on different big projects in same time and would to keep their information in safe and would to reach them everywhere without risk of internet (i.e. PODBOT solves the critical safety problem, thus it can defend the data and information from third parties, against hackers). PODBOT could to work in educational institutions as well, because its software is able to increase the level of education, it can to check the dissertations, can to allocate the notes, etc. I.e. PODBOT cares with portable devices which are in human hand, it communicates, deploys, checks, controls these devices.PODBOT implements the fleet management tasks as well, because it able to communicate with cars, other devices over their own network via satellites.PODBOT CCS Series physically manages maximum 120 tablets and/or 360 smartphones (or variation of these, until the maximum capacity) and connected portable/desktop devices in same time on wireless network (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth).It has peerless computing capacity and power.Its basic software designed for:For example:
Face recognition process. The users have different permission to use saved, stored data and information. The face recognition process can recognise users’ face; thus, it can allocate permissions to authorised users.
Voice command execution. PODBOT can recognise users’ voice thus PODBOT can execute different, complex voice (or written) command(s).
Etc.While the other software support another tasks, functions (the number of software is continuously increase; thus these software are able to implement other specific project-tasks).More information: www.podbot.co.ukServes the institution's communications and network. This is an intelligent Bot; thus, it can do all tasks alone, without human care quickly, exactly, securely.It’s a central workstation, therefore the external enclosure and internal architectures of components are rethought. Everything in the centre, on a unified thermal tube, it’s a chance for the cylinder design and streamlined structure. It has attractive appearance. Completely looks like a cylinder and no other while reasonable.PODBOT has two different sizes and four different portable device storage capacity option.

256,"We believe in human effort and intelligent to make this planet greener. We try to design and invent this project, so to reduce the heavily usage of plastics trash bags. More plastics, its going to hurt the earth further. Many times, these plastics trash bags were not fully utilised with only partially filled with all kinds of trash items before it is finally sealed. That is considered wastage where many plastics trash bags are required and used daily at different locations during different work shifts. More operation cost and more pollution. If we maintain this old procedure, it will greatly reduced the chances of these items to be recycled and given a second life. These trash will most likely sent to landfill together, as its more tedious to process it again at the collection centres where all items were already messed up. It might already became too oily or too dirty to be verified by material. Our idea is to create the smart sorting systems integrated with smart sensors to segregate every item swept by the road sweeper into each separate bins within the same sweeping vehicle. As long as the bins are not fully filled, there is not need for repeat trash bags to be sealed. It also make recycle by material possible & effortless. Example plastics bottles, food wrappers & plastics cards will belong to the plastics bin.

De esta forma, los niños refuerzan los conocimientos construidos en clase mientras desarollan capacidades, aptitudes y actitudes que les permitiran controlar el mundo digital en que vivimos, haciendo una nueva generación de adultos capaces de enfrentar y solucionar problemas mediante el uso de un método.*********************************************************************************With this system, children not only learn control logic and develop algorithmic thinking by programming sequences to make the Biyubi robot move and perform certain tasks, but goes further, by proposing to be a reinforcement of the lessons in class, either In pre-school or primary level, since the Books and Maps of Adventures are edited according to the curricular content of these educational levels. In this way, children reinforce the knowledge built in class as they develop skills, aptitudes and attitudes that will allow them to control the digital world we live in, making a new generation of adults able to face and solve problems by using a method.********************************************************************************Estamos convencidos de la necesidad de atraer a nuestr@s niñ@s desde temprana edad hacia la Ciencia, Tecnología, Ingeniería, Arte y Matemáticas (STEAM), para forjarles a ell@s y al mundo en que vivimos un mejor futuro.Con el sistema True Code Blocks!, los niños podrán:1. Analizar y organizar lógicamente la información.2. Representar la información a través de abstracciones como los modelos y las simulaciones.3. Automatizar soluciones a través del uso del pensamiento algorítmico.4. Identificar, analizar e implementar soluciones con el objetivo de lograr la combinación más efectiva y eficiente de pasos y recursos.5. Generalizar y transferir este proceso de resolución de problemas, para ser capaz de resolver una gran variedad de familias de problemas.Ser capaz de manejar el lenguaje de las computadoras, es escencial para participar de manera plena y efectiva en la realidad digital que nos rodea.Y ¿Cómo funciona True Code Blocks?.Para iniciarnos en el mundo de la programación, no debería ser necesario esperar a que l@s niñ@s aprendan computación para poder operar el software con el cuál programar un robot, aún siendo éste del tipo gráfico. L@s niñ@s necesitan interactuar con elementos reales y poder experimentar con ellos para observar los resultados de manera inmediata, de manera tal que se despierte la pasión por el conocimiento a través de la resolución de problemas y la curiosidad.Por ello, hemos llevado la estructura, funciones e instrucciones de un lenguaje de programación para robots móviles, a una serie de pequeños bloques que funcionan como unidades mínimas de programación, de tal forma que al conectarlos uno en seguida del otro (en secuencia), ese orden de ejecución de instrucciones sea enviado de manera inalámbrica hasta un Robot móvil (Biyubi), mismo que ejecutará de una en una las instrucciones del Programa Físico, en el orden en que fueron colocados los bloques.*********************************************************************************To start in the world of programming, it should not be necessary to wait for the children to learn computing in order to operate the software with which to program a robot, even if it is a graphic one. Children need to interact with real elements and be able to experiment with them to observe the results immediately, so that the passion for knowledge is awakened through problem solving and curiosity.For this reason, we have taken the structure, functions and instructions of a programming language for mobile robots, to a series of small blocks that function as minimum programming units, so that by connecting them one after the other (in sequence) That instruction execution order is sent wirelessly to a Mobile Robot (Biyubi), which will execute the Physical Program instructions one by one in the order in which the blocks were placed.********************************************************************************Es así como tenemos pensados tres niveles de experiencia basados en el uso de Blocks:Starter Kit.Junior Kit.Champion Kit.El programa físico se inicia con un bloque llamado START, necesario para enviar la configuración y secuencia hasta el robot Biyubi de manera inalámbrica.Posterior a éste, se requiere como en todo software de programación, inicializar diferentes ""librerías"" para controlar los elementos abordo de Biyubi, tales como motores, sensores de distancia, sensores infrarrojos, led RGB, el sonido y las comunicaciones Bluetooth; para ello hemos creado el Block SETUP.Por ""default"", las comunicaciones Bluetooth están desactivadas, pero se puede activar mediante un Block de ""expansión"" que se conecta en derivación con el Block SETUP, permitiendo entonces, mediante una App exclusivamente diseñada para Biyubi, su control desde una tablet o teléfono celular.Para asegurar que solo se pueden conectar en cierto orden los Blocks, se han utilizado conectores del tipo DB, siendo de 9, 15 y 25 pines. Ésto nos da una excelente rigidez mecánica y una correcta conexión eléctrica entre Blocks, haciéndolos además, muy sencillos de conectar.Los invitamos a conocer nuestros Blocks:             Estos Blocks de control de flujo, permitiran alcanzar un mejor entendimiento del funcionamiento de contadores, temporizadores, bucles ""hasta..."", bucles ""siempre..."", y a realizar la toma de decisiones en caso de cambios en las variables monitoreadas, ¡Como en un software!, pero con elementos del mundo REAL.Solo con tu apoyo podremos lograr nuestro objetivo de estar en cada escuela preescolar y primaria al rededor del mundo, contribuyendo en la formación Científica,Tecnológica, de Ingeniería, Arte y Matemáticas.¡Gracias por tu apoyo!Conoce Nuestra Time Line:Octubre 2016.

It could follow you out to the garden or yard, into a dark garage or outbuilding, or around a campsite, lighting up the world around you.The main portable lighting solutions currently available generally provide light in a very direct way; that is, from a fixed point and angle. Flashlights require the use of your hands, and cap-lights require a hat and that you aim with your head.

The dolly portion of the Auto-Can holds the weight of the can and secures the can to the device. For steep driveways, high curbs, or other unideal terrain, mounting hardware is included for a secure attachment of the Auto-Can to a trash/recycling can. The RC car portion of the Auto-Can is a stripped down version of a readily available $150 device with some modifications made including higher torque motors, bigger wheels, a more powerful battery, and potentially a wireless charging system (see stretch goals). Lastly, a simple app will allow Auto-Can owners to pilot the device with a virtual joystick. Combined, this powerful package will eliminate numerous headaches for the owners of the Auto-Can!  The Auto-Can has been thoroughly tested with most common trash and recycling can sizes and has been proven to be almost universally compatible with all cans!    The Auto-Can app is a simple interface with an off/on button and a joystick to pilot the device. No need to grant permissions to everything and anything on your phone! No learning curve or huge storage size! Just a simple piece of software to pilot the Auto-Can. If one does not have a smartphone, a manual controller is available as well to pilot the Auto-Can. Backers will receive their Auto-Cans in the mail between President’s Day (February 10) and Easter (April 16) with first backers getting the first devices- so back quickly if you want your Auto-Can early! Your receipt for the Auto-Can could be a great Christmas present for any friend or family member!Kim Simms has deeply felt the need for a mechanized solution to take out trash for years and has finally turned that need into the Auto-Can. Her frail aunt could not take out the trash the last fifteen years of her life and never managed to find an effective solution for getting the job done. With all her family members living miles away, the aunt turned to the trash company and neighbors for help. The neighbors forgot, or were on vacation, frequently so the trash would not be taken out and begin to reek. The trash company charged DOUBLE the normal rate to take the trash out which was a form of legal extortion the aunt lived with for a decade. In addition, another elderly family friend quarreled often with her husband about taking out the trash and broke her hip taking out the trash in 2015. After this incident, Kim decided that she had had enough and endeavored to find a solution to the very common problem of not being able to take one’s own trash out. With a lifetime of public service behind her including being a radiology technician, a crisis pregnancy center manager, and currently a coordinator for international students seeking to learn top-notch engineering standards to improve the quality of life in the developing world, Kim has now turned her focus to the Auto-Can and needs you to back her to help others gain independence.  $5: A word of thanks for helping seniors and the disabled.

264,"The story begins in 2012 when I had a shoulder problem caused by sleeping incorrectly. I built the first prototype for an invention to solve the problem. However, the prototype didn't work very well and the project became more complex than anticipated: microprocessors, signal processing circuit,  and interface design, so I collected a team of contributors or reviewers together. If it was going to be this hard to make a good bed, I figured it was worth perfecting and sharing. We've faced a lot of challenges along the way and realized it doesn't need to be this hard!    We want to save you from experiencing the same heartaches and 30 lots of hardware ready to go so you can skip straight to the interface development and mechanical design stages of your project. Robotics Development Kit 1.0 makes developing robotics projects accessible to Android developers.  Even if you haven't got Android development skills yet, you can get into robotics more easily with a Robotics Development Kit 1.0 as you can focus on learning Android coding and will not have to learn electronics and embedded programming.  We will provide two simple projects to get you started. The first demo project ""BBQ-Sausage-Roller"" controls motor movement according to a schedule using a timer in the Android code.  The second demo project ""Incubator-Temperature-Controller"" will show you how to read data from analogue sensors and how to connect a 20 Watt light bulb into one of the motor ports.  The light bulb controls the temperature within an polystyrene box. You can then learn about Android coding by combining snippets from each demo project.  Both projects are hosted on Github so you can share any improvements you make to the code.  The you will be ready to go on to projects of your own conception.   Imagine connecting together two 3-axis kits together and creating a 6-axis legs-exoskeleton for your grandmother! The circuit board of the Robotics Development Kit and the demo version of the Android App are shown below. After that we will explain how hardware DIY can waste up to a year of your life and why you should use a Robotics Development Kit.Programming microprocessors requires very specific hardware features to be configured. We lost weeks trying to get ADC, UART and USB connections communicating. Another issue with developing projects is choosing high quality yet affordable components.  Discovering reliable suppliers with good prices takes a lot of time.  At the start of the project, the touchscreen LCD interfaces we found online were $200 each.  As this is around the same price as an Android device, we decided to use an Android platform to host the interface: compact, low cost, light weight, offering additional memory processing power, and no need to design the circuitry or enclosure.  When developing the mock-up system for proof of concept, we initially had a NAND gate based circuit but it didn't work well because it didn't allow calibration of the sensors without adding a ton of capacitors for signal smoothing!  So we moved to microprocessors starting with a Microchip USB Starter Kit III to help speed things up.  However, the demo code had an error and wouldn't compile - ABSOLUTELY CRAZY!  Luckily, we had a team member with 25 years programming experience to sort that out. Next was the episode of the mysterious jumper lead breakage... Trust me, that is a headache you DO NOT want:  doubting the integrity of every component, and testing everything for 1-2 days until the culprit is found, afterwards only to find yourself back at the same level of progress. And this happened SEVERAL times!  Also, solderable prototyping boards are of such low quality that the ""tracks"" often peel when any stress is applied.  Quickly we decided to never again work with a bread-board for longer then absolutely necessary to prove a circuit. A small circuit board (PCA) manufacturing run for 10 units may cost upwards of $1200, but when you value your time, you will make that back in a couple of months in terms of labor cost - not to mention SANITY! The reason why jumper lead failure is so likely is because there can be so many of these brittle single-strand jumpers linking various modules, e.g. during the mock-up stage we had sensors connected to a unity gain buffering circuit which connected to a Microchip IO board which connected to the 32 bit USB III starter kit and a Microchip Motor Control Board.  The hardware development stage created more headaches than you need to hear, but included:  Documentation for the IO Board was incorrect for pin connections to the USB III starter kit; Dewert didn't give clear enough details on the wiring such that a NEWB could understand; Lack of enclosures and slippery jumper wires caused frying of 5 different commercial development boards and 3 of my final product boards (prior to properly protecting them in insulated enclosures) costing approximately $1500 in parts plus a lot of labor. This is not even including the cost of the spare parts inventory and intermediate board designs!Although we hope to launch the robotic bed soon, we want to share our work. Our Android developer friends who are interested in robotics can benefit from our learning lessons.  This project will be of interest if you are smart enough to realize how much time you are likely to lose learning electronics and embedded programming, and if you realize how bulky, unreliable and unsatisfactory a product is when it comprises multiple modules taped down and connected with dozens of jumper wires.  We are offering 28 channels of analog to digital conversion; 32 bit microprocessor with host mode USB port, serial and UART connection pads; and 2-3 DC motor drivers, and spare IO ports all housed in an enclosure and pre-programmed (open-source code to be hosted on Github) so that you can send it instructions from your Android device which is connected by micro USB cable (demo Android Java code will be provided), and optional high quality linear actuators to suit. The full list of available commands will be included in the incubator-temperature-controller repository to be hosted on Github.com.  We need the help of the Kickstarter support community to finalize the commands list and functionality to make this product viable. For people skilled in embedded programming and familiar with Microchip 32 bit microprocessors, the labeled photo below shows where PICKIT3 can be connected.  The microprocessor included is a PIC32MX450F256L having 256 Kb flash memory and 64 Kb of RAM (see http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=PIC32MX450F256L for more details).  The standard board is capable of controlling 3 x 1 Amp DC motors (or 1 x 1 Amp plus 1 x 2 Amp) at the incoming power supply voltage (Min 12 VDC, Max 30 VDC) less 0.7 volts.   FAQ section will describe other specifications. ADC connection points are also shown below.The circuit provides a voltage divider and voltage follower circuits for each variable resistance sensor which is ideally has a range of around 0-50 kOhms as the other load in the voltage divider is 15 kOhms. 3.1 volts is available at each pin of the ADC pin headers (0.1"" pitch) and the current flow downstream of the variable resistance sensor needs to be sunk to one of the GND pins.   For people who are highly skilled in digital electronics, the extra IO ports and the UART port can be used to expand the capability of the system. For example, an ultrasonic distance detector (e.g. https://www.openimpulse.com/blog/products-page/sensors/ultrasonic-distance-sensor/) can be added to the extra IO ports.  Robotic vision capability could be added by connecting a Jetson Kit with camera (https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-tk1) to the UART port. Alternatively, add additional motor driver boards. There is some room available within the enclosure. REMAINING PROJECT SCHEDULEOur inventory of circuit boards and enclosures is shown below, and we have additional linear actuators in stock. All that is left to do is simplifying the existing proprietary java code for the Android interface to make an easy-to-understand open source demo code (2 days), and complete the box build for all orders (10 per week), which will be done early-mid October for Early-Bird rewards.Update Sep/2015: Android demo code 1 of 2 completed and uploaded to https://github.com/RoboticsKitGuy/BBQ-Sausage-Roller",David MacNaughton,AU$ 0,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Sun, October 25 2015 8:48 PM UTC +00:00",Soldering free.

265,"The project represents a conviction that the magnificent engineering behind my Sphero 2.0 deserves a more heroic use than owners playing with their balls by themselves. My Sphero deserves a worthy opponent willing to put her or his toe on the line to win or lose. And there is no more appropriate place in the Universe for a robotic brawl than a bar.
Note: The project first envisioned a battlefield for ambulatory robots with arms and legs.  But they represent a galactically greater cost than a pair of balls, and it requires skilled-nerd-level programming to operate them.  Plus, they are not the quick agile robots of video games.  They are ponderous and plodding. Besides, to our disgrace, we couldn’t find more than one wealthy individual with nerd-level programming ability who drinks at our bar.  Therefore, going with technically fascinating, but ponderous and plodding, entities could only lead to poorly attended events at high school auditoriums, or government run programs that prohibit battlefield competition anyway.
Hence our  choice of robot.  And for lack of the wealth needed to  go it alone, our hope it’s possible to launch an Open Source Project around a concrete, brick and mortar, physical world, result.  Not a sure bet, because  to date, it appears Open Source projects are limited to producing magnificent, but ephemeral, bit and byte world, computer programs. 
More specifically: Build battlefield #1!  That is, produce one prototype, bar-quality (i.e. ruggedly indestructible) battlefield for two teams of Sphero 2.0’s. Convince a bar to make space for it as host of the first round of a Galactic Sphero 2.0 tournament.  Release the complete prototype package, i.e. manufacturing quality drawings, lists of components, names of suppliers, bids from model builders, and everything else needed to cheaply replicate it. A package that would normally be patented. (E.g. A new computer chip that cost millions to design and prefect, after which, as China too often demonstrates,can be very cheaply replicated – only in this case legally.)
Then hope it becomes the foundation of a larger Community of volunteers – builders, players and bars -- who collectively build more, improve the design, add innovative traps and obstacles, make space in their bars for its use, and otherwise spawn an interest that sweeps the Universe with an organized Tournament of Galactic Dimension … and sponsors begging to pay for putting their logos on the champions’ balls.
But  every journey, from once around the block to a 1,000 league adventure. From insignificant to epic, begins with a single step.  So in this case, someone must build Battlefield #1. Straightforward? Yes. Simple?  Not.
Note:  Open Source creation is a proven model, but only for bit and byte world software.  That’s because Open source software creation costs its contributors nothing more than their free time. However, attempting Open Source creation of a brick and mortar project costs real out of pocket money. That is not a trivial difference.  It is not yet proven.  So there is no guarantee Open Source works outside of Cyber Space.  But if it doesn’t it will not be for lack of effort.
So far, a Honolulu bar is committed to making space for a weekly tournament.  That requires Battlefield #1 (which as drawn is approx. 4’ x 8’)  be easily and quickly broken down into storable parts, then easily and quickly reassembled into a rugged … nearly indestructible … free standing whole – many many times.  And designing and building things that come apart easily, and go back together ruggedly, are not trivial engineering problems. And they cost much more than free time.
In addition, the bar will also contribute two 3-ball teams (roughly $700 worth).  Why? Because Sphero’s are engineered so ball owners can allow anyone who downloads a free iPhone app to connect and control the bar's balls.  Then take back control when done. That means newbies won’t have to buy their own to see if they like playing, i.e. anyone who shows up can play with the bar's balls, or lay their own balls on the table. [From the bar's  side: A) We succeed: it will have been  a trivial contribution compared to the drinking crowd it will draw. B)  We fail: The owner has six great Christmas gifts for grandkids or a charity next Christmas. Plus the owner bet a lot by opening a bar in Honolulu's dying economy, so it needs something new, different and cool to survive.  This is all three.  The right three? Only time will tell.  And then only after it’s built and deployed.]This is the 21st century, so Battlefield #1 will be built. It will have a permanent home in Honolulu, because its just too cool not to attract a following. And it may just prove Open Source can be extended to the brick and mortar world or the physical universe were everything important ever done is … well … ever done.Best guess is the Battlefield Community will fit well as a sub-class of the larger scale, already existing, Robotics Community. (Again, please see RobotShop as a good illustration of what’s been spawned by interest in armed and legged robots.) They could. So we can.
And history is on our side.  Look how the wheel was a giant step forward from levers and sledges, and Star Wars’ gangly C-3PO matured into the more elegant spherical B-88, so maybe armed and legged will be come a sub-class of the Sphere based community!It will take a professional model maker to manufacture parts suitable for deployment in a bar. And that will be 75% of the funding need. This is not a toy, so they will not be inexpensive, because Battlefields must survive hard battle use long enough to make it worth the cost of building one. And if you’ve hired a prototype makers before – people with the computer controlled metal lathes, drills accurate to a 100th of a millimeter, years of experience, data bases of suppliers for one of a kind components, etc. – you know their costs cannot be tied down in advance anymore than people who were promised an awesome web page would only cost a few $1,000, or had a binding “quote” for kitchen or bathroom renovations of their home, ever tie their contractors down.Therefore all that’s certain in advance, can be promised in advance, is we live in the 21st Century. We know this is doable. And we can guess a safe cost estimate from experience, the same way a NASCAR driver “just knows” he can take a banked turn, in a drizzle, at 236 mph – a safe bet that will neither win or lose him anything. And “Just knows” at 240 mph he will spin into a spectacular crash – a bad bet that will lose. And then rolls the dice on 238 mph for a win – an honest bet that guarantees a win if he makes it. Experience-based intuition. Not an MBA type worksheet calculation.This can be done. And all it takes to get it done are enough people who want it done enough to contribute to seeing it done. And only time will tell if there are enough. It always does. Anyone want to try? It’s a cool idea, with a fun outcome.

266,"The CleanCopter combines the maneuverability of a multicopter system with effective and environment friendly cleaning technologies. Its main field of operations are hardly accessible glass surfaces indoor and outdoor. The current prototype is based on an octocopter with a lift capacity of around 8 kilograms. Therefore it is capable carrying the cleaning gadget and multiple sensor devices to perceive its environment. The cleaning gadget consists of a carbon framework and two continuously rotating brushes. Due to bay-mounted supply pipes the interaction between the cleaning gadget and the air flow of the propellers is decreased to a minimum. The CleanCopter uses only demineralized water. The combination of the abrasive effect of the brushes and the demineralized water guarantees a high quality cleaning result. No cleaning agent is needed. No peeling or scrubbing afterwards is needed. The CleanCopter is ready to fly and waits for …… Our main goal is the automation of the whole cleaning process. It includes an automated start and landing, the carefully approximation to the glass surface and the cleaning process itself. We come up with experience in the field of autonomous UAVs and analyzing sensor data. In addition we want to improve the current UAV frame to include a safety concept and an easy exchange system for batteries and the water tank. The frame of the CleanCopter has to protect the sensitive electronic parts during the cleaning process.

268,"The founders of Unique Pontoons, Mark Little and Jeremy Little have been studying this market for several years. Their research has revealed the need for a new and innovative product to bring new buyers to the market and to entice current pontoon owners to switch to a safer, more convenient boat.

Mark Little was diagnosed with deteriorating lung disease and passed away shortly after the final prototype was built. This brought the expandable and trailer-able pontoon manufacturing to a screeching halt. His son Jeremy promised his father a week before passing away that “He would do whatever it takes to mass produce the pontoon.” 

In 2014 Jeremy won the Fowler Business Concept Challenge at St. Thomas University, in 2015 he won Best Working Model, the Gold Medallion, and Peoples Choice at the Minnesota Inventors Congress, he won the best presentation award in 2015 on the EIX Online Business Plan Competition, and first place along with Peoples Choice award at the 2016 University of St. Thomas Business Plan Competition.

Since then Jeremy has reversed engineered the prototype pontoon, with the help from the University of St. Thomas and Norris Financial Institution. He has recently built the first Dealer Show Boat that was displayed at the Minneapolis Boat Show this January and will be at the Sportsman Show this April, 2017.  

Jeremy Little is making his father’s dream a reality and nothing is going to stop him from keeping the promise he made to his father!

The product Unique Pontoons is a tried and tested product that will revolutionize the pontoon industry.                 Mark Little, (Lakewood Community College) was a welder/fabricator, but more importantly he was an inventor. Specializing in the mechanical ability to extrapolate complex problems, Mark overcame multiple barriers to allow Unique Pontoons to become a reality. He thought up, created, and patented several different products including an award winning kit that converts a three-wheeler into a four wheeler in less than 15 minutes. This design won him the gold medal in 1989 at the Minnesota Inventors Congress. Unique Pontoons was his biggest creation and is a legacy he left behind for everyone to enjoy for years to come. The funds will be used for obtaining a larger manufacturing facility, equipment, and inventory. Unique Pontoons offers a competitive limited warranty on structure, decking, and pontoons.

270,"Very grateful to Kickstarter to launch this project to develop and create QiBots arduino open-source robot prototype and hope that backers can contribute to this project because they want to support a project about robotics, educational toys, coding, mathematics, art and inspire everyone to have access to low-cost robots which can be built upon with functionalities beyond their imagination. I have always seen robots as amazing programmable tools but too expensive to own which was what motivated me to build one to suit my 'pleasure' and to do far exceeding more things as an educational aid than what I would have spent 400-1000 USD on. Hence, QiBots was the to fill that creative void and now everyone will be able to have access to it for $45 and build upon it too. Because if we're to see further it'll be by standing on the shoulders of giants and backers too.What Are QiBOTS ?Qibots pronounces as Chi robots or chi bots. The word 'chi' symbolizes 'life force' or 'energy', in some beliefs 'Chi' means Supreme being or supreme life force in every existing creature. Hence, QiBots are robots that will bring liveliness to an environment be it in education or entertainment once a prototype is built. Backers should understand that they are contributing to a project that is still at the development stage but that contribution backers make to bring the prototype to life will be one that will make good quality, researched and highly developed robots low-cost, cheaper and more affordable at the lowest possible prices. The Qi-Bots programmable robots will be built with customized PCB circuitry and wooden objects found in an average home combined with open-source Arduino programmable micro-controllers. Sixteen years ago robots for entertainment and educational purposes cost from $400 - $2500 now with the power to create and innovate robots with better functions can be affordable at prices lower than $50. In today's world a robot the quality of QiBots would cost close to $450 that's not all, because robots are such remarkable tools, I believe they should be ubiquitous and should be found in every home to educate, entertain and whatever work they are made to do but how is that vision to be accomplished if robots like QiBots are not low-cost and easily accessible. How is such a feat feasible, is it possible ? Can a robot with the same power and functionality as an AiBo or Lego Mindstorms really be low-cost ? Yes, it's feasible because we have the technology and it is possible because again we have the technology as predicated by Moore's law. As a result, the reason Qibots was invented and once the prototype is complete by reaching the funding goal, the QiBots will be made affordable from 10% of it's current market value of $450 to $45.                                                   QiBots Are:LOW COSTLow cost open-source robots that will have wide range of functions including line following, obstacle avoidance, drawing and a host of fun learning Artificial Intelligence software packages to thrill and edutain with Qibots etoys. Because, we believe robots that aid education should be for everyone and not just the ELITE CLASS. Hence, QiBots educational robots have the same capabilities if not more than with other expensive robots in the mainstream market which are only available in Elite schools and homes but QiBots cost a lot less and will be available to everyone to be affordable to students even in remote educational institutions and homes if funded successfully.EDUCATIONAL, SIMPLE TO CODE AND FUN FOR EVERYONE  Learn. Code. Play. Repeat w/ QiBotsWith the open-source Arduino IDE, ArduBlock graphical programming language can be embedded onto the IDE or created as an app controller. Kids or people who have never coded before and professionals can create simple codes that are executed immediately allow the user to imagine 'sketches' and see them come to life. The application embedded in the QiBot will allow the user to learn by doing what they imagine. And because the QiBot is very engaging you get to learn how to code, play with your code and do it all over again with a new code.QiBots will also be an Open-Source educational Robot fully loaded with functions and interactive software that emphasizes on the problems of mathematical proficiency, coding basics and engineering principles which makes it a great low-cost tool for young students, robotics projects for schools. Mathematical ProficiencyQiBots can be a programmable robot or etoy as a means to explore basic mathematics using basic geometry, art and coding; one example is by coding and drawing basic shapes. Research has proven that programmable robots can instill mathematical interest in young kids from ages four to eight years old.The idea is to entice users from a tender age to cultivate the love for a subject such as mathematics. To achieve this goal mathematical packages will be programmed into the robot to demonstrate in real-time. These subjects will be chosen to create value in the user's learning experience in areas such as shapes, geometry and trigonometry. As a result, the robot will be able to demonstrate simple geometric shapes that the user can program into the robot. Coding PracticesThe use of educational interactive programming languages with fully enhaNced IDE which have a simple and visual programming effect on the user such as ArduBlock and Logo visual programming languages will be used to develop basic programming principles for the user     Basic EngineeringQiBots will be able to demonstrate the principle of simple machines and basic mechanics, the subject will be taught in physical and visual forms using the combination of the robot and the software program so that the user gets a realistic application of the concept being demonstrated.Great For Classroom And Competition Robotics Activities    Great for young inventors to engage into robotics activities to have fun and learn by doing coding and engineering activities. A good educational tool to immerse anyone into competitions and summer campsConnectivityA Sneak peek feature of QiBots after the prototypes are made to our backers who contribute to the programmable robot is that QiBots will also serve as a companion that connects with peers who have the same robot, so a robot social network online community, via bluetooth or Wi-Fi which is easily accessible from any computer communication device.MANUFACTURED TO MECHANICALLY ELECTRIFY THE FUNFrom solderless breadboard testing to schematics to PCB design and manufacture. The QiBot motor/servo controller will be customized to make assembly easy for you so you don't have to face all the rigorous wiring that can ruin the board or fry the circuits.This is why the internal hardware like a proposed H-Bridge motor shield will be fabricated w/ a desktop CNC machine tool to reduce cost and for good quality for easy connection and control of the QiBot which is based on an open-source Arduino microcontroller.Note: Arduino powered L293D w/ SN754410 motor drive shield design and manufacture features may vary from the picture below.  The Arduino Uno controller functions as the control unit for QiBots. All Arduino Uno microcontrollers are based on the Atmel AtMega168 microchip that stores codes to control QiBot, it is QiBots brain.EASY TO PUT TOGETHER With no soldering required, the upgraded QiBot prototype will require screwings and clips while the control board can be plugged and programmed to play. Each hardware part will be tested and developed with 3D CADD design software, Fritzing, MATLAB and SimuLink simulation while Desktop CNC machine tools can fabricate final designs.3 Stages QiBots project will run -Time-lineCost Of Building The QiBots Prototype:- Desktop CNC machine tool for Robot Hardware - $1,000- Hardware Materials for QiBot Prototype - $200- Software development - $300- Kickstarter fee includedTotal = $1,500",ICare Power Generator,£40,"Funding UnsuccessfulThe project's funding goal was not reached on Mon, June 15 2015 8:58 PM UTC +00:00",We believe educational robots should cost £45.

273,"The Gundam Project is an project based on manufacturing a large mechsuit robot, thats engineered to out run the old modern ways of robotics known to many engineers and scientist. This is the new way of engineering robotic mechsuits. 7th Leadership Organization is an architect engineering company that produces new designs and machinery technology. The Gundam design originated from Japan. It came  from an anime known as Mobile Suit Gundam, by creator Yoshiyuki Tomino. This anime breached a new surface to the mechsuit world and many other media generous. What 7th Leadership Organization way of seeing the Gundam or in other words Mobile Suit as really a tool, not in science fiction but in this actual reality. 7th Leadership Organization or 7LO has made this a certain by creating the accurate blue prints and diagrams to this machine. What we want to accomplish is to be the worlds leading Mobile Suit producer and the worlds best Mech Suit company in this millennium. This means that are goals are to be the worlds first Mobile Suit manufacture that distributes are products to many sources that apply to are guidelines and regulations.7LO has breached the point of a new era in robotics and plans to expand its territory with the world. These Mobile Suits are not for fun and requires skills and necessary uses only. But theres always another side to things like that, and that is sports. Robotic Sports is the new wave in futuristic athletics. Mobile Suit tournaments are going to be quit different from typical robot or giant robot tournaments for example the Kuratas vs the Mega Bus. Mobile Suits are more advanced than that, and can be used to ultimate fighting machine toping those two robots. Theres regulations to the Gundam and for one theres a great purpose.In this world we live is theres constant natural disaster  every year and we seem to not have the actual technology to scout and clean up after those events in a quick and easy pace. Well thats no longer a problem,because now with this new system 7LO will change those procedures greater direction involving the Mobile Suit. Mobile Suit will play a key roll in disaster clean up services. No matter how big of the damage is caused these machines get the work done. As shown in this photo below, this is one disaster the Mobile Suit can get to labor in.  Earthquakes happen everyday but large earthquakes happen almost every year and this cause severe damage. Rubble and debris is left un-handle and many times the conventional construction tools can handle  the most needed work times after the event happen. With the deployment of Mobile Suits these machine can do what five bulldozers do at once, and get into tight areas the other tools cant. The Mobile Suits play a key roll in the future of construction and emergency equipment. Its worth investing in these machines because of the power it creates that others can scratch the surface on commissioning. Mobile Suits are helpful tools and can save many lives. When it comes to military many countries want there military to have great weapons to compete and win a war against other territories. The involvement of the Gundams is more greater than any weaponized system if equipped with the tools to handle war bound missions. Conventional tanks an guns are the past and the future now realizes on the power of Mobile Suits. These Mechsuit can be equipped with customize blast proof armor, that can survive a Nuclear attack. 7LO blueprints configuration states that all Mobile Suits have air sealed cockpits with dual air pocket tech. This is in case of an emergency resulting in NBC, nuclear biological or chemical attack, disaster or accident. This machine is ready for the world of military power.  Wars will no longer be fought with outdated tank system. This system is over a century old. Mobile Suits have multiple functions making it an ultra weapon, and these are things that a tank on modern armed vehicle cant do or even prove.The actual mechanics behind the mobile suit is amazing and is a recipe that creates the ultimate machine in doing multipurpose task. The actions that this machine takes is almost the functions of humans limb movement system. It changes the perspectives of robotics and machinery in general. Its almost as its a perpetual machine but in other terms a perfect machine for many situations. 7LO engineering diagrams are well designed and organized for building this machine, and the mechanics that back this machine is more advance than all robots ever built by man. 7LO main objective is to build this mechsuit and shape the direction of this company in a greater form., resulting in mass production of Mobile Suits and different models. Building this Mobile Suit takes a lot of financial stability and effort. This also will bring opportunity and employment for many people who are interest in this field of technology. Support 7LO in this project and help make are company success reach its top charted score. This Project is important and urgent. Remember this Mechsuit is a tool that grow great achievements in the future.Project will start in 2016 and will end in 2017 or later if time is needed.

280,"www.projectrobro.comHello, I'm Aryn Sparks, inventor of project RoBro. I originally came up with the idea for project robro in the 9th grade, when reading about neural networking in decision making computers. During which i was attending 9th grade anatomy classes. It was then i realized that if a true thinking machine could be built, it would have to be designed by having a network of intercommunicating computers. This is where project RoBro comes in. Project Robro is a thinking computer network running on a raspberry pi! I would like to prototype with more powerful machines, but funding is scarce. I would also like to bring other people into this project and patent it, but again funding is scarce. Right now RoBro is nothing more than a computer program capable of running on small mobile arm platforms. I would like to see it as a small sellable mobile machine.
Heres some spill on what RoBro can do!
Some of these capabilities are from Project RoBroSapien which is the next evolution in project RoBro.Project RoBro is a multi stage project. In order to achieve the goal of project robro (to design and complete a running robrosapien) We must first implement our software on a hardware platform. Currently we use raspberry pi units and arduino, but these are not powerful enough to run our advanced algorithms. As such this kickstarter is to fund stage one of project robro. the stages are as follows.Stage 1: RoBro BrainStage 2: RoBro NerveStage 3: RoBro OpticsStage 4: RoBro EarsStage 5: Mechanical implementationStage 6: RoBroSapienAll funding in excess of the requested $25,000 will go toward the next stages of project robroJust to be clear, project RoBro is in the programming stage and funds are needed before any physical prototyping can begin.www.projectrobro.comwww.projectrobro.comFunds will be used for-1. Incorporating ProjectRobo so that private contractors can be hired for design help.2. Hiring a patent attorney and beginning the patent process.3. Purchasing web space, to implement database storage.4. Purchasing hardware components to begin prototyping the RB-Br (Project RoBro-Brain) unitSo....What is project RoBro you ask?Project RoBro is an ADLAR system (advanced deep learning assistive robotic system). It can be used in almost any application. Simple applications, like monitoring your home for you while you're awayor more advanced applications, from the soldier pressed for time as his RoBro helps him get from one point of cover to the next, while helping him aim quickly and with pinpoint accuracy, to the firefighter, trying to evacuate a collapsing building or extract someone from a crushed car.The possibilities are endless.While wearing project a RoBro suit (codename RoBroSapien) you are training it to do the things you do. It can learn to cut vegetables or stitch wounds. It can make you faster, stronger, more agile all while running off of patented tesla energy technology.Project RoBro draws from an ever growing extensive database of movement and audio visual information to form a mobile neural network. Every action, every reaction, every sight and every sound is analyzed by RoBro and added to the database.Imagine if you will a construction site. A steel beam is being lifted up by a hydraulic forklift ($30,000-50,000) and attached to a large 5 story crane ($75,000-200,000) and is moved in to place and set down atop a building by three men on the ground. Add in the salaries of 5 men total and you've got over $500,000 invested in moving that one steel beam. With just one project RoBro, that beam could have been placed on the rooftop by one man using an industrial elevator, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars.Project RoBro is more then that though. It can be an automated system for your home. Just think what it would be like, if your home knew you had arrived, then opened the door and dispatched a drone to make it easier to carry those groceries it noticed. Or if RoBro sensed you were late getting home, then had the oven preheated for dinner and the tv already waiting paused on your favorite show.RoBro can be placed in cars, to automate driving tasks and even take over in case of emergencies. Robro can be that extra second it takes to avoid a crash.Hospitals, Military bases, police departments, fire department,  automotive and even your own home, can benefit from Project RoBro!Project Robro can fly drones and planes, it can automate assembly lines, conduct trains, monitor and adjust traffic flow, it can even do your taxes! The boundaries of artificial intelligence are nearly limitless.RoBro consists of a modular system designed to integrate in to almost any scenario. First we start with a project RoBro brain unit. This unit contains all the necessary hardware and software to build a learning mechanical unit. Then we add situational hardware. Cameras, hydraulic lifts, wireless systems, lights, anything required to made RoBro fit the task its assigned. Current prototype models are in the preliminary stage and are based self learning autonomous humanoid tasks.funding will also be used to purchase the required tools and hardware to build a finalized Project RoBro Brain unit and RoBroSapian prototyping.RoBro is the friend who helps when you're lifting something too heavy, its the boost you need when you're running too slow.

282,"Battleye Models was created at the beginning of 2014, with the aim of creating a range of tank models which can engage in competitive battles The aim of the Kickstarter is to raise enough money to purchase the equipment required to achieve this, including a work space, 3D printers, a resin casting/ degassing chamber, and the computer software needed to design and build the tanks’ components.

The first step of our fundraising campaign is raising enough money to be able to purchase our own dedicated work space. We are currently using a shed for this, which is not without its difficulties. The main disadvantage is it is not as secure as it would need to be for a long-term project.

The second stage of our fund raising would be used to prototype models. We have already created a Tiger 1 prototype but would like to develop the range of Battleye tanks further.

The third stage of our fund raiser would be used to develop a battle control system which will allow Battleye products to engage in battles with each other. This is one of the more complex parts of the development stage and is expected to last a few years. We will then start to produce the models and ship them to our supporters.

283,"The oceans of the world are in a bad state and better monitoring of its environment is needed. This objective of this project is to take a newly invented autonomous sailing buoy concept to a WORKING PROTOTYPE.  Research has shown that it is possible to navigate such SOLAR POWERED buoys just by wind and sea current by specified paths to spedific locations. There the buoy could collect measurements and transmit the results to a base station via wireless link/ satellite communication. Large areas of oceans can be monitored by a fleet of buoys, tracking pollution etc.. Search and rescue operations can be performed over large areas etc. Funding for this first phase is used entirely for hardware: Custom solar cell platform; electronics such as power inverter, battery load system, communication system, GPS tracking, mechanical components and control systems.The present invention relates generally to monitoring ocean buoys and to an autonomous buoy that can go on site by itself and stay there using the wind as its sole means of propulsion, thereby removing deployment costs. The invention related more particularly to a buoy consisting of a single rigid body for the envelope, and an internal actuation system which increases the life of the autonomous buoy, requiring very little maintenance. Monitoring the oceans is a matter of primary importance, not only for ongoing research related to global warming, but also for other activities such as oceanographic studies, the fishing industry, and military operations. For many of them, a number of different parameters such as temperature, salinity, wind speed and direction, wave height, are regularly measured over time and at different locations around the globe. Among the means available to obtain these measurements, buoys that gather and send data are widely used in observation and monitoring programs.Existing buoys currently used for weather monitoring, acoustic transmission, etc. either require mooring lines to stay on site, or are allowed to drift away. Furthermore, in all cases, they need to be deployed by ships, thus implying a significant cost due to deployment alone. Whenever needed, maintenance is also another task which can be quite costly.In the ocean engineering community, self-deployment and re-deployment was already considered in the form of autonomous self-propelled platforms, usually small robotic ships equipped with a propellers and thrusters. However, these solutions typically need a lot of energy and their batteries have to be re-charged quite often, thus limiting their life expectancy.Instead of using propellers, it was also considered to resort to older means of sea transportation, whereby the wind would play a crucial role, and a number of robotic sailboats were built. The problem, in this case, and for monitoring platform applications such as data buoys, is that the appendages of the boats, i.e. the sails and the rudder, can after some time and harsh conditions be damaged by the marine environment, resulting again in a relatively short life expectancy.If one considers the rudder, steering a sailboat without the aid of a rudder is not a new concept. The sailboard and all multi-masted craft are capable of being steered by their sails alone. In cases where the rudders of multi-masted craft have been damaged, the skipper's only means of steerage has been by properly trimming the sails to alter the balance between the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces. Likewise, the sailboard alters the balance between the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces by pivoting a single sail forward or backward over the center of lateral resistance of the keel. The rudderless sailboat offers yet another choice for the sports minded sailor. While the sailboard also uses a rudderless method of sailing, it is somewhat difficult to master and requires physical stamina and a good sense of balance. By contrast, the rudderless sailboat is easy to master and requires little effort to operate. However, all these examples still contain external moving parts (the sails, the keel or the mast) and are therefore not suited to longstanding operations in a sometimes extreme environment.Rudderless sailing would bring sailing robots abilities which are identical to sailors being able to sail rudderless: in case the rudder brakes, they won’t be totally out of order. Secondly, and maybe more importantly, it could also be seen as an alternative way to steer a vessel without the need of an external part (the rudder), which would make the vehicle more resilient to extreme conditions. It is worth to note that a particular jellyfish known as the Velella Velella, which has a small triangular sail as a part of its body and uses the wind for propulsion, changes its body shape and its balance in order to alter its direction. As a concept design, a system with no externally actuated part has been tested. The applications of autonomous buoys, capable of returning to a predefined harbour/location, are numerous, for example: •	A sensory platform for oceanographic measurements, either following a predefined path or staying at a predetermined condition. •	Surveying systems for identification/localization/tracking of pollution (oil, plastic fragments in ocean etc.) •	Communication/ relay stations during search and rescue operations •	Platforms resistant to extreme weather conditions (icing) due to no external moving parts 
The weight balance steering mechanism has been patented (US9139272B2).
The following milestones are planned: Milestone 1:  Funding for prototype design by Kickstarter.com Milestone 2:  Construction of mechancial platform Milestone 3: Construction of sensor and communication platform Milestone 4: Succesfull field tests, proof of concept outside lab.The focus is now on commercialization / development of a product line as well as further development of the autonomous sailing buoy sensor platform for research and industrial applications.

287,"Picture it: you're a dad and you like to fish. You happen to have a son who also likes to fish. This is the making of a beautiful outing in the tradition of a cherished pastime. Yet, fishing can get boring and ineffective with lifeless bait. It also doesn't help that you have to keep moving the rod all the time to give the bait the appearance of movement. But why settle for an illusion when you can have the real thing?

That's where Bait & Take comes in—a self-propelling tool that takes care of the tedious work for you. You can use that valuable time to bond. After all, fishing is often meant to be a social experience. 
 It can enhance the professional fisherman's experience, too. Whatever your situation, your focus should be worrying about catching big game, not bobbing the rod up and down and casting the line over and over again.
Without going into the finer details of how it works (we don't have a patent yet; refer to the FAQ for more info on that), suffice it to say that we've done extensive research and have concluded that there's nothing like Bait & Take on the market. Sure, there are ""lures"" that shake and vibrate—but cellphones can do that, too. It's nothing special. Fishing bait deserves something more sophisticated, something geared specifically towards the art of fishing. With Bait & Take, our aim is to create something truly lifelike at an affordable price.What you see in the video is our last prototype. Think of it as a proof of concept—we wanted to demonstrate the feasibility of a product like this.

288,"We're MegaBots, Inc. We just finished a 12-ton, 16-foot tall, 430-horsepower combat mech called Eagle Prime and fought Suidobashi Heavy Industry in the Giant Robot Duel - all with Kickstarter's help! Since challenging Suidobashi, dozens of robotics teams from all over the world have told us they want to fight us next. With your help, we can host the world's first Giant Robot Tournament and launch the craziest sport the world's ever seen!We have more than 3 years and $6.5M worth of investment into developing these robots and this sport. We have one of the founders of the UFC on our staff, we've been working with the former video production staff of Mythbusters on our videos, and our engineering and fabrication team comes from high end robotics companies, defense contractors, and industry leaders. We have the best shot in the world at making this sport come to life within the next decade.We need your help. We have the technology, the rockstar team, and the ambition to make this sport become a reality, but we need hardcore fans to help us fill an arena to watch the first live tournament, watch our videos, and advise us as we create the sci-fi-inspired sport fans want to see. By participating in this campaign, you're sending a message to potential investors and big media companies - you want this sport to exist so badly, you're willing to help build it from scratch.If you want to see the mecha and giant robots of science fiction come to life, we need your pledge now. This campaign is the culmination of years of planning, and failure of this campaign will likely mean MegaBots closes its doors.Several teams want to attend, but are waiting until we have final tournament details nailed down - but you all want to know who's going to be there in order to back the event. We have a chicken-and-egg problem on our hands. What we do know is that the Chinese teams GREATMETAL (creators of Monkey King) and Fighting My Bots (creators of Yamantaka) are rearing to go, and want to bring their bots to the tournament no matter when or where it is. At a minimum, we can bring both Iron Glory and Eagle Prime to the tournament and take on China. We've heard from over 20 other teams in China, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia, and the USA who want to attend, but all of them are waiting on the final details of this tournament before they can commit to building their robots, finishing their robots, or shipping their robots overseas. If more teams want to attend than we can manage at one live event, we'll need to come up with a qualification system to determine the final fight card.We need the funding and a guaranteed audience in order to commit to a specific arena, lock down a date, and set up the live event production team necessary to kick off this sport. A long time ago, we came to Kickstarter and asked for help. We needed funding to upgrade our robot, but more importantly we needed devoted fans who would support us over the long haul, follow our story, and understand what it takes to create something completely new. With their help and patience, we made good on our promises - we built a 12-ton robot, took two giant robots to Japan, and had a Giant Robot Duel in an abandoned steel mill 5,200 miles from home. We're in a similar situation again, on a larger scale. We have teams all over the world interested in building and fighting giant robots. We've created awesome robots ourselves, but both our robots and everyone else's need more R&D to become as fast as modern sci-fi audiences want. We need rules and regulations that don't exist yet, that will only take shape after trial and error. We need to figure out how to capture fighting action on camera live, in a way that works as well for fans at home as it does for fans in the seats.Once, again, we need hardcore, committed fans who will step up, trust us, and support us as we work to make their dreams come to life. That's where you come in!We're building gigantic, cutting-edge robots that have never been built before. Teams from all over the world will have to build their own custom robots to keep human pilots safe in fair fights between multi-ton machines, all while looking cool to audiences that have gotten used to watching decades of computer-generated science fiction... that has never had to work in real life. Our mission is to bring this sport to life, and that means we're continuing to push the start of the art of robotics at this scale to make faster, cooler, and safer robots. That also means that we need to support teams all over the world who are building robots to compete in this sport, so we don't all reinvent the wheel over and over again. If this campaign is successful, we'll be open-sourcing our MK2-class Iron Glory robot to give this sport a huge boost. At higher levels of funding, we'll be publicly researching how to make the robots faster, selling proven parts that work in combat to teams, providing teams financial assistance so they can build their robots and get to the tournament, and more!As we continue to develop new technology at MegaBots HQ, we'll share our progress publicly - just like we did during MegaBots Season 1. Our audience, and other teams, will be able to follow along and help guide our R&D efforts to make this the global sport we've all been dreaming of.If this crowdfunding campaign is successfully funded, we will:Past our initial funding, our stretch goals cover everything from awesome new merch and robot figurines, to public R&D to help everyone make better robots, to doubling the number of teams at the tournament, to adding an East Coast tournament, all the way up to designing walking mechs. Join us!VOTING RIGHTSWe're committed to bringing you the science fiction-inspired sport you want to see. By backing this campaign above a $15 level, we'll add you to an exclusive mailing list that we'll consult when we make major decisions about the sport. We're not putting our entire company or vision up for a vote, but we think direct feedback and some decision-making from an engaged audience is crucial. Some of the elements of MegaBots Season 2 that our fans will get to vote on include:We're asking for your help starting a sport from scratch - we need your feedback and engagement as much as we need funding! EPIC MERCHANDISEWe have a ton of new merch for giant robot fans! We have iron-on patches, stickers, shirts, hoodies, a bunch of posters, and even a comic book. As we confirm teams for the tournament, we'll make sure you get access to their merch, too! For now, check out what you can your hands on during this campaign.First of all, everyone who backs our campaign above the $5 level gets their name on our website in the Hall of Heroes. We'll be creating a new section of our site and immortalizing those who help create this sport from scratch, like we did for our Eagle Prime backers. Additionally, all backers above the $15 level get a digital wallpaper pack of our posters!We now have patches and stickers for MegaBots itself, Iron Glory, and Eagle Prime! Vandalize your workspace, living space or your own stuff with stickers - OR, iron your favorite logo onto a work shirt or jacket! Add $5 to any pledge $10 or higher, per additional sticker or patch you want.We made a comic book with DC Comics illustrator Jorge Corona! This is no made-up space opera about imaginary robot fights - this is the gritty, behind-the-scenes story of what it took to start MegaBots, design and build giant robots from scratch, and get to where we are now. MegaBots #1 focuses on the crazy, completely improbable adventure of moving our entire company to San Francisco... ...and dealing with everything from historically extreme weather, to lazy salespeople, to run-ins with the cops, to near death experiences as we built the 6-ton, 15-foot-tall Iron Glory in 3 months flat. If you're a maker, mechanic, tinkerer of any stripe, or regular ol' giant robot fan, you need to pick this up. We've even included never-before-released images that inspired the comic and additional backstory as bonus content! Add $10 to any pledge $20 or higher, per additional comic issue you want.If we hit our stretch goal, we'll make a whole series of comics to share the behind-the-scenes story of our past 3 years: challenging Suidobashi, raising venture capital investment for giant robots, navigating Hollywood, building our crazy team and Eagle Prime, and having the Giant Robot Duel. These comics let us tell our true story in ways that videos can't capture - you're getting a never-before-seen view of what this has actually been like.We have a TON of new posters to share with you. We have the epic stadium and arena concept art you just saw in our video, our first MegaBots LIVE! poster, an epic picture of Matt on Iron Glory (originally taken for the Wall Street Journal), our comic book cover, and a series of real-life shop drawings of Eagle Prime's parts!The Process poster series is the real deal - we took real engineering drawings the shop floor used to build Eagle Prime, and we turned them into posters. This is a tiny sample of the hundreds of drawings needed to actually build a mech. Add $15 to any pledge $30 or higher, per additional poster you want.We're bringing back our MegaBots crew shirts, and we have womens shirts and kids shirts! Rep your favorite sports league with the same merch we wear on a day-to-day basis! We have new, robot-specific jersey-style shirts for the first time ever! The number on the front is the class of robot (MK2, MK3, etc.), and the shield on the back is each robot's unique coat of arms. Show off your robot pride by repping Iron Glory or Eagle Prime! Add $25 to any pledge $50 or higher, per additional shirt you want.We have San Francisco-approved hoodies for the first time! Rep your giant robot addiction even when it's cold(-ish) outside. Add $50 to any pledge $99 or higher, per additional hoodie you want.We've combined all this merch into SUPER, ULTRA, and FAMILY packs! EXPERIENCESMerch is cool, but it's just not enough for you. You want to be there, at the first live tournament in history, watching science fiction come to life before your very eyes. Engines are roaring, the air is full of diesel and gas fumes, hydraulic oil is spraying everywhere, and giant robots are fighting... and dying. It's the future. You've arrived. Grab a basic tournament pack for your ticket to the sport of the future, plus some basic swag! We're going to make sure our Kickstarter backers get some of the best seats in the house for being early adopters and believing in us! Add $75 at any pledge $125 or higher, per additional ticket to the tournament you want.Do you want to see HOW the magic is made? Get a season pass! You'll get access to all of our MegaBots LIVE! events where we test new rules, new tech, new weapons, and new play styles!

Sign up for our VIP Season Pass! Add $500 per VIP ticket to the tournament, and $360 per MegaBots LIVE! VIP pass, to any level $975 or higher. On top of ALL of the above, do you want to strap into Eagle Prime and destroy stuff? Great. Sign up for a gunner experience or a takeover experience. As a gunner, you'll be up front in Eagle Prime with your choice of weapon loadouts, working with a MegaBots driver to beat up on targets in our yard OR anything you'd like to bring with you - like, for instance, that old beater car you've been meaning to get rid of. In a takeover experience, you and a friend get complete control (driver AND gunner) of Eagle Prime, and you get to play with 12 tons of raw destructive power in our testing yard. Eagle Prime experiences will all be held at MegaBots HQ in Hayward, CA, and will be scheduled on a per-backer basis over the next year. Contact us at inquiry@megabots.com if you'd like to arrange for custom Eagle Prime appearances at corporate events, parties, bar mitzvahs, etc..If getting front row seats to the tournament isn't close enough to the action for you. join our Pit Crew. Pit Crew backers get the ultimate behind-the-scenes access to MegaBots and the rest of our teams - they get to be on the ground floor during the tournament, embedded with the teams in the pits. Last, but most certainly not least, sign up to sponsor the world's first Giant Robot Tournament!

I'm still down for attending a tourney in the US so please keep the mailing list so I can grab a seat (and that sweet Eagle Prime shirt) when they become available! Perhaps securing some other funding and subsequently launching a Kickstarter with a lower goal to make up the difference will work. This is also an expensive time of year for many with the holidays so that might be a factor in why things went as they did. Don't give up!~  Sad to hear, but hopefully you can figure something out. I'll be watching!~  Sadface! Hopefully you guys can find an alternative way to make this insane yet awesome sport a reality! If you come back to Kickstarter you have my support!~  NOOOO!~  Just backed you guys for $180, hope to help make history with the votes and witness dreams come true during a tournament event.~  Guys don't give up and maybe figure out an alternative campaign to keep the ball rolling :) Maybe 2018 is too early for the Tournament giving the state of the current mech abilities?~  I only whish I could give you more... The success of this enterprise is more than just a robot fighting league, you are building the future of Mech design and starting a community that will be able to finally assemble all the different Mech research and testing on a real field of expertise. Some might see it just for the destruction, but there is so much more... like movement ability, better balance. Someday Mechs could be used in a wide range of feilds!I just hope some other (more rich than I am...) will see this and contribute for what this is really worth.~  I'm pretty skeptical that this will be funded. That's a lot of money and you guys don't even have that original hype like you did for the first fight. I wish you good luck as I really want to see more though.~  @Adam_Dunne, I couldn’t agree more my man! Fingers crossed (and wallets open) for this to succeed. The project needs to earn ~$31,700 per day to hit the mark!~  Also, would like to say that I bought my merch and my ticket to this event. I'm stoked. I don't care where it's being held, I'm gonna make my way there to see this go down!~  To those of you who were not satisfied with the duel on Twitch, just remember what the first cars and the first planes were like. And look at what we have today. Also realize, that the technology is already out there to have 20ft tall walking mechs and 1:1 controls with a pilot's own bodily input. All we need to make this happen is a few years, some cash, and some traction! This is a dream come true! The Megabots team are all truly pioneers.~  Dear project Team, do you see any chances of getting Boston Dynamics, Endeavor Robotics, Rethink Robotics etc. into the boat as sponsor, consultant etc.? Did you allready have contact to some of the main leading robotics producers? If the tournament will become reality, this will also be a giant marketing machinery...maybe not like NFL...but who knows... All the best wishes - Markus~  @Goliath and @Dac, I agree with you guys. But by pledging, we are able to offer our voice and recommendation to MegaBots Inc., and if they’re smart, they’ll listen to their audience. With that being said, it’s important to remember that this is the genesis of something HUGE! The first cell phone was not pretty, nor did the first computer have much to offer. Now look where we are! I see it this way, if MegaBots can at least create an interest and a supportive fan base in this new genre, then the money will go to where the fans are - and if that fan base happens to be gathered around a “better” tournament without MegaBots, then so be it. But for now, I pledge what I can with hopes that they succeed. In the end, it won’t be much of a financial loss to us if this all hits the fan. Drone racing would be cool. Personally, I’d like to see a smaller scale “American Ninja” course that the pilots must overcome before they can enter their mechs!~  I pledged what I could afford at the moment and I hope the goal is met. The duel in Japan really left a sour taste in peoples mouths so I have my doubts it will make it. I am hoping there is enough people that have faith in it to make this succeed. I still think making it into a full on robot event with drone racing and maybe some other RC stuff for intermissions and could really make it a complete event.~  I backed a dollar just to say that if you want this to actually become something, It needs to be much better than the fight on twitch. Forgetting that it looked scripted as all hell, it was just bad. I honestly will be surprised if this makes the goal.~  Just to clarify, I don't want this to fail nor do I want to just hate on the creators, but I feel like they need to actually bring something entertaining to the table.~  I supported the Duel and I'm more than happy to jump in on this one too!  You guys did great last time and I can't wait to see what you do here on a bigger scale. That you're willing to help the other teams get off the ground to make this sport a reality is inspiring and though combat and blowing things apart is the goal, I really think with this sort of approach, this project will bring people together in the best of ways.  I'll see you from the stands!~  I can't wait to see this happen, I want this to become the next big thing.~  Please show us what the figures look like! I will back as much as I need to get one of those!~  I'm a student majoring in Computed Science. I backed this as much as my poor student wallet can afford :). Best of luck Megabots! Good job against Japan!~  Currently a college student majoring in Computer Science - I love programming and backed this Kickstarter because I would love to see this sport evolve, not only for the excitement and accomplishments of robotics engineering, but also for the jobs it could provide! MegaBots inspires me everyday to keep studying so that one day I might be fortunate enough to be on a team.~  This is awesome.  I want to see the robots evolve and the fights get bigger and better.~  Yes, yes, 1000 times yes!I was a backer of the dual against Japan, and now I'm backing this one!I'll support anything that gets us closer to the days of Robotech and Voltron!~  I want to do this kind of stuff myself! Can't put too much forward as a student but I'm happy to back this still!~  Let's do this!~  Awesome! I just backed and I backed your last Kickstarter too. (As well as that very first one).

What is the list of countries?~  First I want to thank you guys for being awesome and doing this project. You have provided so much information about this project and it looks really cool.~  You guys mentioned that your wheels can be remote controlled, does this mean it can be controlled like toy cars? I didn't see in the demo.~  I also am curious if the PV can be auto guided. What I mean by that is if it can travel from point A to B without direct human control.~  Thank you for your response!  Rephrasing my question: I'm happy to do some DIY work, but I just wanted to make sure that I can, for instane, motorize my skateboard, using the stuff included in the preview kit.  The listing in the preview kit has as ""included"" no batteries or chargers.  Does that mean that there is a separate way to charge it that we can easily get hands to, or that it is not meant for use?  Since the lowest pledge that includes batteries and chargers are the developer kit, I wanted to make sure before I make my final decision.~  Thank you again for your quick reply!~  Catherine~  Hello! I am living at Shanghai China.  I realy like your product and backed the dev kit. But KS web just has one shipping option States only. Other people from different countries may also has this concern. Please let me know what should i do when i am not living in States.~  Quick question: from my reading of the rewards, it seems that if I want to actually try use the product, I shouldn't get the ""preview kit"" because it does not have the batteries or the charger -- I should at least get the developer or beta kit.  Is that correct?~  You may want to check out their other project. They've changed backer names so it's hard to see what else they have ""created"", but I'm happy to spend a $1 to comment. ~  Hex: A copter that anyone can fly!https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1387330585/hex-a-copter-that-anyone-can-fly~  Just read the comments. Unfortunately, you can't see all the updates if you weren't a backer. But they are the same company, advertising for this project. I'm not saying back it or don't back it. I just wanted you all to make an informed decision, which was made difficult by the name change.~  Do not back this project. This is not this teams first project. Please check out ""hex a copter that anyone can fly"", and read the comments to give yourself an idea of what kind of disaster to expect.~  Before anyone thinks about backing this they should read the comments for the creators last kickstarter project . Hex: A copter that anyone can fly!  ~  There are a lot of backers complaining they never received their rewards, even 1 year after the first set of rewards were sent out. ~  On that project there were problems with communications, an a lot of unhappy people, I hope the creators have learned from their mistakes, and that flex PV is a success as it is an interesting project.~  That deserves a video! I'm really excited about this and already have a project in mind! It solves a problem I have. I have a small trailer with a tiny dune buggy body. Molded into it is a cooler and a tool box. I drag it behind a full size dune buggy. I have always wanted to add two more wheels and make remote control - but doing so has been difficult. ~  I considered buying a used handicapped power chair and modding it - but if you can ""steer"" with your app using two kits, you've solved my problem!!! Congrats on your product. I truly think FlexPV can make anything mobile! Very cool!!!~  Do you envision a future release where two FlexPVs can be used to steer a vehicle?~  This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.~  ",0,"$20,000",FlexPV: An Open Vehicle Dev Kit For Everyone (Canceled) by FlexLab Community — Kickstarter
290,"Thanks all for all the support!--Nancy, Cappie, June, Will L, Will K, and PabloWe're back!  After our adventure with robot arms last December:The Narwhal course was a great experience. With Nancy and Cappie's help, to get me over some bumps, I went from zero to making things move the way I want them to. Can't wait to go deeper. When is course two? --Karl S.We've come to offer you even more creative robots in pursuit of our goal  of getting diverse students interested in engineering. We've learned a lot from our first Kickstarter and realized that there just aren't enough robots for all the students out there.  We've decided to stare that problem in the face and charge at it like a narwhal diving for arctic cod. So we came up with an accessible platform to allow you to tinker with your very own swarmbots so that you too can learn about creative engineering! Now we need your help to have students join our class, build a community, and be excited about engineering!Multi-robot Formation Demo (if you want more demos, but want gifs instead of a video, scroll to the bottom section of this page!)Researchers and professionals have been making sweet sweet robot formation demos:
You know you want some, too. The appeal of lots of robots, the synchrony of choreography, the emotion of dance -- all of these are now at your fingertips.  These cute little guys are just like real ballet dancers, without the drama. They will follow your commands without question: no fighting over who gets the lead role, no complaints about long rehearsals, never having to go to the bathroom, and an RGB (red-green-blue) LED built in! Balanchine could only have dreamed of dancers like these.We'll show you how to get started, and you can let your creativity flow.  Only the greatest dancers today can incorporate live FFT (fast fourier transform) and beat detection into their routines, but not a single one of them emits electro-magnetic waves in the visible light spectrum.  Yet all of these talents and more will be a part of your troupe.The process is simple:
Robots are your dancing friends of the future.  And they love to party.Don't worry, we know that the robot enthusiast inside you isn't satisfied by dancing and photon-producing wonders of silicon fabrication technology alone.  So we're going to teach you all about how it works.  The magic of FFTs, the wonders of computer vision, the simple pleasure of making a robot scoot its butt across your floor, and more will all be put into an on-line class.  We strongly believe in hands-on on-line learning and want you to get the most out of your wild, dancing Swarmbuddies.Based on what we learned from our last class, we're going to start out with a forum for people to share what they are doing with their robots and for us to help people implement their ideas. After we see exactly what everyone wants/needs to learn, we'll make lesson plans for a class to be run in March of next year (2015).  Knowledge and dancing, it's gonna be a blast!  That being said, having some basic background will be very helpful. You should, for instance, know what a for loop is. Just follow through on http://www.learnpython.org/ and you should be all set!Each Swarmbuddy is a bundle of Bluetooth Low Energy and RGB LED joy. The tentative finished product specs (depending on the volume of orders) are:They will require minimal assembly (10 minutes with a screwdriver and super glue per robot) (screwdriver and superglue not included).Optional BundleWe also are providing an optional bundle if your laptop doesn't have bluetooth low energy support, you don't have an external webcam, or you want a frustration-free experience. It includes:Note: In the daytime, you can track the robots with any external USB webcam by taping a piece of paper with a red dot and a green dot on top of the robot. For nighttime tracking, we use two infrared LEDs forming an elliptical blob, along with an external camera with the IR filter removed so that infrared (IR) light registers better on the camera. A floppy disk or exposed blank film is used to block visible light and pass IR light when working in low-light instead of complete darkness.Alternatives to the Optional BundleThe CSR 4.0 Bluetooth dongle and external USB webcams are widely available commercially. You can find them on amazon, ebay, or at local electronics stores. Most external USB webcams can be taken apart and their infrared filter removed. A piece of floppy disk or exposed blank film serves well as a visible light filter that passes IR.Optional CapsWe offer a selection of caps, currently either a penguin, turtle, or narwhal. They are thin and come in plain white to allow the RGB light to diffuse from under them, but feel free to decorate them, especially if you are only using the caps for daytime use!If you're interested in a different animal or design (a lotus flower?) let us know!Prototype SpecsIf you're wondering, the specifications of the current prototype are different in these ways:We have written control software in multiple platforms and languages to give you an idea of the versatility of this robot. Basic commands such as going forward, turning, or changing colors works out of the box with:If you have processing, here is some sample code you can run to see our prototype desktop-based GUI:https://gist.github.com/nouyang/8b4ed079b7ef60c85cd6Our code structure makes it very simple to write different applications for the robots. If you are wondering, you simply connect to a socket and write a servo or RGB command like so:import processing.net.*; Client myClient; outputs = ""2,20,90,90"";myClient.write(outputs+"","");Where the command structure is: $botnumber, 20, left_servo, right_servo OR: $botnumber, 10, redvalue, greenvalue, bluevalue More complicated computer vision / tracking of multiple robots using Swistrack works out of the box withWe may set stretch goals, depending on interest, for getting the OpenCV-based tracking software working on Android and iOS using the smartphone camera.Just like for our last product, we will release all files as open-source hardware and software. https://github.com/NarwhalEdu/Every reward that includes a Swarmbuddy includes access to our course. The exact course content will depend on what you all would like to learn about. One possible course is outlined below:Testimonials from our last course:The course given by Narwhal edu was really useful and fun to go through; it offered easy-to-follow instructions and tips for any problems people were facing with their setups, and the online community created around the course was very encouraging and helpful. Best of all, it exposed me to some new things about programming that I can use easily outside of the course. I hope this program continues and expands to include all sorts of great introductions to interesting robotics. --Owen G.All of you are the wonderful people who will help us get these robots out into the world! The reason why we are building so many of these is to bring the cost down so more students can access the course and have it be affordable to them (and to us!). We need your help to push our prototype to a finished product.  Our biggest costs will be a PCB redesign and tooling for the diffuser dome/case.  After that, we just need to make enough Swarmbuddies to take advantage of economies of scale so you can have lots of miniature new friends.$70k -- Backers' choice of another custom cap design!$150k -- Allows us to hire another full-time engineer and ship in time for Christmas!Last December, we raised over $20,000 on kickstarter with the help of 188 backers for our first class, ""Robots, Drawing, and Engineering: An Online Course.""

291,"We are a group of hardcore roboticists, with talents in mechanical engineering, computer science, software engineering, embedded systems, communications, design, and web & app development. On March 26 2014, we founded Dexta Robotics, a robotics start-up that focuses on developing high quality but affordable robotics hardware that lowers the boundary of robotics and virtual reality. We believe that there is a lot of great talent in your creative minds; a lot of interesting projects you want to do. But it can be really expensive and hard to build your own robotics hardware. Our goal is to build this bridge for you.
 
 A year ago, we noticed the lack of affordable hand motion capturing devices in the field of robotics and VR, so we started Project Dexmo. To further increase the sense of immersion, we also started developing ways of adding the force feedback on top of the exoskeleton system.  Long story short, after 17 iterations and over 12 force feedback implementation tests, we are proud to say that Dexmo is finally ready for release. As for our production ability, we are fully aware that a lot of very successful kickstarter hardware projects fail when it comes to production because they only start seeking manufacturing partners after they get the money. At Dexta Robotics, we do it a bit differently. We applied the principle of DFM (Designed-for-manufacturing), meaning we talk with our manufacturing partners before we design our hardware, including Dexmo. We understand what designs are easier and less expensive to produce and what designs should be avoided to reach minimum manufacturing difficulty. We can't guarantee that everything goes perfectly smoothly, but we will certainly try our best to deliver on time.So far, Dexmo has been covered by:For media inquiries, please shoot us an email at press@dextarobotics.com and get our press kit.Live testing and demo of Dexmo controlling Unity hand and Handuino at Oculus Connect and VRPlay China.Thank you all for testing and commenting on our products!Palmer Luckey tested it too; however, according to Oculus’s policy, he can’t comment on the device. But just look at him:Dexmo comes in two forms: Dexmo Classic and Dexmo F2.Dexmo Classic is a wearable mechanical exoskeleton that captures 11 Degrees of your hand motion. It senses three degrees of freedom of motion for the thumb, and both the split and bending of the other four fingers. One embedded IMU sensor will allow Dexmo to also output its orientation along x,y,z axis. (A video of dexmo working with Razer Hydra)Dexmo F2 provide you with digital force feedback (on/off only) for your index finger and thumb that allows you to feel a digital object on top of hand motion capturing. We managed to combined all that into one single device.Dexmo F2 achieves feedback by braking the joint using our patent pending technology: a miniaturized joint gear-disk braking mechanism.When a collision is detected(either by the collision detector in a program or by a pressure sensor in real life), a signal is sent back to the device,  then the actuators activate and brake the joint, the exoskeleton locks, preventing the finger from further bending inwards, thus creating a normal force on the user’s fingertip.Here is a video showing how the force feedback unit operates.For RoboticistsDexmo can be used for controlling a robotic hand, also providing you with a better sense of presence by simulating a force feedback when an object is hit..or controlling a robotic arm, or something a little be more advanced..Like controlling double robotic arms performing a remote bomb disposal task.For VR developers and Gamers: With Dexmo F2, we can take VR to its next level, it adds a sense of touch to gaming and now you can now feel the size of a digital Object. (However please note it provides digital force feedback, meaning on and off only, you can't feel softness, yet.)Dexmo will come with some out of the box example game for you to play with. So even if you are a gamer with no experience in programming, you can still use dexmo, and you will be one of the first group of gamers to explore the possibly-next-gen gaming experiences.or sizes of other different objects,You can interact with the digital world more naturally, without the limit of space since Dexmo is wirelessor play everybody's favorite game: the Surgeon Simulator.For Makers and ArtistThe 11 channels of the analog output of Dexmo can be used to control a lot of things.You could use Dexmo for hacking all sorts of RC devices. The picture above shows a modified RC tank being control by Dexmo.  (We took apart its original controller and wired it to a micro-controller and Bluetooth receiver.) From as simple as lighting control.to as complex as tuning music for music production, or interactive art.With appropriate position tracking methods, you can also use Dexmo to play a virtual piano. Or other very useful tasks like translating sign languages. (The above demo was only for demonstration purposes. so we only wrote the program to recognize this one line.)Futuristic: due to its exoskeleton nature, we couldn't make it small, so we made it cool. (We've removed photorealistic rendering images of the industrial design due to Kickstarter rules. However, we are actually working on that deisgn.)Robust: It doesn't break easily, and it works even next to a strong magnetic field because Dexmo does not use magnetometer.Affordable: Instead using of expensive sensors like IMUs and flex sensors, Dexmo uses inexpensive rotational sensors, along with injection molded plastic parts, the cost of the device can be greatly reduced.Dexterous: Dexmo has a special curved exoskeleton design to ensure it doesn't block any of your hand motion, so you can make a fist, or split your fingers even while wearing it.Wireless: It transmits data though Bluetooth serial ports, you can easily hook it up to your computer and mobile devices.For roboticists and makers, you can get the raw data from Dexmo using our provided Arduino library. Or you can also use our Dexmo SDK from your host computer.For VR developers, Dexmo comes with a very easy to use SDK, which contains a few examples with our built-in hand regeneration algorithms that help you pick it up easily. You can use Dexmo along with any positioning tracking methods of your will, and Dexmo also provides special support examples for perception neurons by Noitom and the STEM system by Sixense.CEO & CTO of Sixense at Oculus connect. After OC, we met again at one of Sixense's offices in Los Gatos.We are very good friends with the Team Perception Neuron ( Noitom) as well, and have visited their headquarters in Beijing multiple times to discuss about our further cooperation.If you still haven't got your perception neurons, click the link below for registration.http://perceptionmocap.com/pre-order.htmlThe advantage of using Dexmo with Perception neurons is that, you only need the 10 pps kit to have a full upper body motion tracking, since a pair of dexmo can do the job of 14 pps for your hand motion capturing.An early stage test of Dexmo with Perception Neurons will be posted soon. Dexmo also works with various optical solutions; however, special support is not included by Dexmo SDK, so we will leave this for you to explore :)In the past year we have developed 17 prototypes of Dexmo and tackled countless problems, and now we are finally proud to say that Dexmo is ready for release. Here is a brief history of how Dexmo was developed.Dexta Robotics: We are a group of hardcore roboticists, with talents in mechanical engineering, computer science, software engineering, embedded systems, communications, design, and web & app development.

Looking forward to hearing about any new plans and just a tip: 'use' the backers you had now for any next campaign. These are the people who believe in your product!~  VERY sad about the lack of support - I hope you will be back.  I'll be keeping an eye on your devs.~  @david mudder  for the hell sake u just partially killed the project and sincerely hope u could receive your controlvr before 2017~  Sorry to hear that you will be cancelling.  This will give you time to get more kinks worked out and come back stronger!  I wish you the best and will keep watching for more updates.~  I would love to see this project take off! I'm an avid VR lover, and this seems like a wonderful idea! I agree with some people on here that you guys need to make a lot more updates. Show the people that it's worth the investment! Hoping it makes it!~  As I stated before, if you want your campaign to be a success, we need more updates, many more (last update was 6 day ago, an eternity in kickstarter). You need press coverage, update your FAQ and so on. You need to step up for your project.~  I am saddend to see that this project is quite definitly not going to make it. Do you guys have anything big planned still for this campaign? Or a plan B for when this campaign fails (e.g. run a second campaign in january and be present at CES with as many media as possible)? I don't mean to be the pessimist here, it's just that at the current rate I don't think anything's going to change (top out at max $100k) and I really want to see this product succeed (no matter how dubious I am about the current hardware :P ).~  Is it possible to let us know if you plan to support Unreal Engine and CryEngine?~  What about standard c/c++ API, would those be made available within the launch window?~  Thanks,~  Two questions: - Why did you guys discard the gloved version? It seems a lot easier to put that one on and it looks better as well - Does the force feedback stop you from moving in both directions seperately?~  and also make sure to put questions that you answered in the comment section in the FAQs.~  @Creator - please make sure to make frequent updates: pictures, videos and so on to attract more people. The guys from Perception Neuron did a very good job. I'll keep on spreading the word on forums, social media, et cetera and I hope my fellow backers join me. Let's make this wonderful project happen!~  60ms is about the same as the Hydra right now, which is plenty good. 40ms would be great.~  Yeah, I thought bluetooth would be the limiting factor. Thanks for the info, can't wait to try mine out! :)~  In your examples, you were using the Hydra in combination with the Dexmo. Are you going to support the STEM, as you would the Perception Neuron mentioned in your Kickstarter? Also, if we were to purchase the Perception Neuron would we only need the 10-Neuron package in combination with the Dexmo?~  What is the latency of your prototype? What is the specified latency of final product?~  @Dexta - would you guys doing a nice latency measurement video/demonstration so that we can easily point to it and debunk uninformed people trying to claim that the latency is too high (despite their incorrect assumption that latency can accurately be judged by eyeballing a video of output on a laptop, which inherently includes the laptop's monitor latency, and is thus wrong flat out). ~  Unfortunately not many people like to stop and realize that it's basic logic that judging latency based on the output on a monitor will include that monitor's latency, which is not representative, so we need a good video measurement to show people they are being foolish and should understand some basic principles before going and spreading misinformation based on their incorrect knowledge of how this actually works.~  Thank you!~  Hi!I didn't see a estimated delivery date and was just wondering if you have an idea of a preliminary date?~  Is it easy to pair this up with arduino projects?~  @Dexta: I know, I know, for me it's mostly about ""How much value does it add at this point"". The simplest interaction to me seems to be interfacing with varoius 'control panels'. Regardless of whether such a control panel is the dashboard of a plane in a game or a simple keyboard, if a glove could make such interactions feel natural *enough* (which they do not do currently) then that's a HUGE win. Either way, as I said, I would have to try the current version out in real life to know for sure. :P~  I have been giving this project so much thought the last few days... I am just can't figure out how succesful this approach is going to be. How much value this truly gives without the ability to stop the hand from moving as well. For example, if I understand everything correctly making a virtual keyboard using this would be impossible as one would miss another joint at the hand-arm joint. Once that does get added I could imagine this being quite a valuable tool. So wish I had a chance to give this a try in RL before the kickstarter ends.~  @ Creator: thx for your explanation~  Hi. In the description, there's pictures showing object and ball grasping games using Unity. Do you also plan to support Unreal Engine 4, including its blueprint scripting system? Thanks.~  Thanks! Good luck, I got her to back the project also ^-^~  My friend wants to back the project also, but she was wondering where you can specify left or right handed controller (she is left handed)?~  +1 for Shadiel Chan's suggestion~  Hi! Is it possible to get an earlybird for a pair and is there a possibility to get the product before the estimated delivery time?~  Congrats on launch. Good luck on meeting the goal (though that looks like it might not be an issue).~  Awesome product. Got a chance to try it at Connect and am now looking forward to build something for the two handed F2!~  Hi, I'm 沉竹。congratulations on the lauch of your campaign~  I can't wait to receive this product looks great to do some interesting tests with it as a student.~  ",0,"$200,000",Dexmo: an exoskeleton for you to touch the digital world by Dexta Robotics — Kickstarter
292,"  Sign up at moti.io/keep-updated. We love iterating with our early community. See the latest opportunity here.You can find us on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram!  MOTI is a new way to stay accountable and motivated for building those habits you know you should be forming, from exercising, to eating healthy, to staying mindful.
There are plenty of apps and wearables for habit formation, but we know that humanity isn't just about knowledge and data - it's about emotion. Based on the latest insights from behavioral science and social robotics, MOTI works by being more than just a device: he's a friend who sets up the right types of reminders, celebrations, and accountability seamlessly into your life. One-size-fits-all doesn't work when it comes to our psychology - and our motivational needs change as we progress through different stages of our habit formation.MOTI may be simple on the outside, but on the inside he packs the smarts needed to analyze every element of your habit. MOTI learns from your setup inputs, personality profile, individual compliance data, and how you compare to the rest of the MOTI community. The outcome is a program of the right reminders and rewards specific to you.  And their MOTI's weren't even as smart as yours will be! Still, how can something so simple be so effective? The reason MOTI works is because we've based on over a decade of academic research in behavioral science and social robotics. Here are a few key principles from the brain science of habit formation that MOTI utilizes:     Each MOTI works with one habit at a time, so that you can prioritize the one that is most important to your life right now. MOTI works best with habits that happen at least every other day, and that are relevant to a particular location. Here are some examples of habits people have used with MOTI in the past:After setting up your habit through the support app, place your MOTI in the location best suited for your habit - such as your bedside table, office desk, or entryway (don't worry, we'll you help pick!). Next, MOTI integrates the three elements of a habit loop directly into your lifestyle:     You'll know your daily progress simply by looking at MOTI (Green? You're on track! Red? MOTI isn't impressed...). The MOTI supporting app allows you to go even deeper. Set up each habit with best practices, learn your motivational profile, view all your analytics, and ""push"" MOTI remotely through the power of wifi connectivity:  MOTI knows that if he gives you the same celebration over and over again you'll get bored, or that sometimes he needs to become more of a drill sergeant than a cheerleader. When MOTI is connected to the web he is constantly learning and analyzing what types of celebrations and reminders will motivate you the most, or whether you're at risk of falling off or need a break. The first MOTIs are available in three color choices: turquoise, dark grey, and light grey. Pick the one that best matches your home or office!With the app, you can also fully customize your MOTI's settings (light colors, sound pack, volume, etc.). We'll be developing MOTI's ""expansion packs"" with feedback directly from our backers, but here's a sneak peek:MOTI Possible Sound Family A: MOTI Possible Sound Family B: MOTI Possible Sound Family C: In the early days, there was an ""app for that."" But, now we are in complete notification overload and so easily distracted by emails, texts, social media etc. whenever we pick up our phone (even if we meant to do something else entirely on it!).Then came wearables with the promise ""if you can track it you can change it."" The problem is, that's not actually true - numbers and data alone are not enough for true motivation. Not to mention having to remember to charge and put on a wearable each day (two habits just to get to the one you're actually trying to form)!MOTI is deliberately not app or a wearable - he's designed to be an different medium entirely, one that is based in a deeper psychological understanding of what it truly takes to form a new habit.  MOTI's founder and inventor, Kayla Matheus, first came up with MOTI to solve a problem in her own life: forming the habit of physical therapy at home. To understand why everyone seems to struggle with good habits, she immediately embarked upon process she had previously taught at universities across the country: human-centered design.In fact, MOTI was invented within the context of a new founders program specifically for designers called 30 Weeks, which spun out of the Google Creative Lab in 2014. At 30 Weeks, Kayla surveyed and interviewed hundreds of people, and it was directly through user testing that the idea for MOTI was born. (The first ever MOTI is actually the koala bear at the bottom right of the above picture!)In Summer and Fall of 2015, MOTI had matured enough through our first MVP and Alpha prototypes that we sold the first batch of MOTI beta units across the country. The results were extremely promising, and we learned many things about what should and should not be included in the MOTI experience.A few interesting things we learned:
At MOTI, we love hardware. So much so that both founders hold engineering first degrees (ME and EE), and in the Winter of 2015, we successfully completed the hardware accelerator, Highway1. At Highway1 we took our product from proof-of-concept prototype to the designed-for-manufacturing (DFM) stage. We also took a trip to Shenzhen, China to see how the most famous products in the world are built. Now, we're are now actively engaging with manufacturers across the globe and preparing the final details of production.MOTI is co-founded by Kayla Matheus and Laura Day, who first met at a Women in Hardware event in San Francisco, specializing in robotics. Together, they span expertise in design, engineering, and business and are incredibly passionate about bringing products and services to the market that truly help us be our better selves; not technology for technology's sake. (See video above for more)Kayla and Laura are joined by an incredible team of experts that make MOTI possible: We are also joined by a group of partners that have supported us along the way in all things design, entrepreneurship, and manufacturing!       And a big thank you to you for meeting MOTI.

As a backer I am committed to Moti, and very much want to have a finished product at some point, but would be much more disappointed to have invested in a failed campaign. I appreciate all of your open communication and support of your backers, and you have my continued support in return. I look forward to following Moti's journey and to being a part of bringing a great product to market. Thank you for your commitment to building the best business and product possible.~  Possibility to keep track of backers and offer a better deal {kind of early bird pledge but for first batch backers}.   I think it could ease disappointment knowing that you recognize we were there at the beginning!~  To add to the previous comment.. We gave you our love and support, this is no way to treat your early supporters.~  Started to watch the live stream, stopped after  30 seconds, do you seriously think our disappointment is something to be laughed at? really?!?~  Nicole Weiß ++ agreed, very disappointing~  I'm really really disappointed that you canceled the campaign, and yes, I am also a little bit angry. I fell in love with Moti the first time I've seen it, could barely wait until August to get my own.~  I clicked the link to the batch program as soon as I read the mail to see that its sold out. Furthermore, because I live in Germany I even had hadn't a chance to get one.~  It's like ""Nice that you like our Moti and wanted to spent money on it, now get OUT! FAST!"". :(~  More than disappointed, I am respectful of the courage it took to cancel such a project in order to rescale it based on what you've learned. Good luck with your smaller, more focused efforts. I look forward to seeing the results in your maillist.~  Hi there,We're writing to let you know that MOTI | Your Smart Companion for Better Habits (Canceled) has been canceled by the project creator. As a result, your $114.00 USD pledge has been automatically canceled and your card will not be charged.If you'd like to follow along with the creator's next steps, stay tuned to their updates. You can even drop them an encouraging message or comment on their project page.Thanks for supporting this project.~  What happened.?~  Sorry to hear about your decision to cancel, even more disappointed to find out that international backers have been ruled out of supporting your small batch program.~  I went right to the page to keep on participating as soon as I saw the news, delighted that I'd got in nice and early, ready to keep on supporting... only to feel really let down by that. That's a real shame. What was the reason? I would have gladly covered any shipping costs.~  Oh well, best of luck for the future. I hope you find a path that suits you!~  Do I need an app or can I access the settings through a browser?~  On WIFI:I always turn WIFI off during the night and when I'm not home, I do realize that I have to have my MOTI on always (thankfully the light is not always on according to a comment below). Will MOTI still work if I turn WIFI off and is there a way to turn WIFI off on MOTI after programming it (software or hardware) so that I don't have a device by my bed constantly looking for a WIFI signal, it's not healthy, especially not for sleep. Please take this into consideration. Perhaps you could add an alternative way to program MOTI by connecting it to a computer through a USB cable and there you could choose to turn WIFI on or off, if you don't want to add a hardware button for it on MOTI (I assume it is not there).~  How come you did not choose to add eyes, nose etc?~  Also: Is there a reason why you chose the turqoise color, did you study the psychological properties (cultural ones excluded) of color and is that taken into account on MOTIS different moods, since the main form of communication MOTI uses is light, right?=)~  I am eagerly looking forward to using my Moti to develop better habits! One feature I would love to see is to be able to develop more than one habit at a time with my Moti. Would this be possible in future software upgrades?~  Will there be a way to export the data for analysis in another application like Tableau?~  this is super kool! check us out when you can :)~  Is there a customer service? Will not really be 11 months after the delivery of it? My email address is 1546923812@qq.com?~  Hellow,I am a Chinese, MOTI can be set to Chinese? Which price can buy a MOTI? What are some of the 99 dollars?~  Can we please have a magenta/pink/raspberry color option?  I think Moti would be smashing in that shade!~  I'm very excited by this project, I think it could be a great motivator!  I would like to see a scheduling component added to the app, so that as my schedule changes Moti can adjust his hints accordingly.  With the option to work on multiple habits being discussed, I think the scheduling would be beneficial as Moti will know when you're supposed to be working on a specific goal and if you need extra motivation for a certain task as compared to others.  Hopefully this is helpful!~  This seems pretty cool and i do have trouble forming habits so i thought i'd give it a go :) I do have some questions though.~  1. Since there are multiple things i'd like to work on do we have the option to do so based on certain times a day? For instance at 10am i could go to the gym and let MOTI know when i come back and he can mark that in the app and then a 1pm i'd like to do some writing for an hour and then he can mark that and so forth so we can do multiple habits at once based on time and day?~  2. Is MOTI going to change physically when he's released outside of kickstarter? Looking at him now he looks cool but i'm wondering if this is going to be like a smartphone sort of deal where there will eventually be different versions of him where physically he improves or changes and then we have to buy a new model? I'd only like to buy 1 since money is tight for me and i don't want to have to upgrade to have an important feature later on.~  3. I'm assuming the app will work on both IOS and Android but could you confirm this and that future updates will be free for users? ~  That's all i can think of for now so thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm really looking forward to trying MOTI :)~  I absolutely cannot wait for this to come out! I've needed this for a number of years now, so it's definitely exciting that someone has actually brought it to life. ~  My wedding in in ~1.5 years and have a lot to work on before and after the big day. Exercise, eat healthier, drink more water, take a break to breathe are only a few.~  I have struggled with willpower when it comes to health and fitness for the last decade. To have something physical to cheer for my successes, hold me accountable, and to ensure that I keep motivated and on track when I'm not feeling so positive, is exactly what I've needed. Thank you so much!~  I'm left with a few questions as far as how moti will operate on the day to day:~  1. Are there certain times that moti's light / random sounds it makes happen aside from the time you push it to notify it that the task has been completed? Like, what are the triggers for say, when it gets mad that you haven't done the habit, is it at random or?~  2. Is it possible to alter the brightness of moti's light or configure it not to be on at certain times (ie sleep, I plan to have it in my room)?~  3. Will I receive any sort of reminder from either the physical moti or app that I should do my habit / can I configure this to happen at certain times?~  4. Do you think the ability to have moti handle more than one habit (mentioned in faq section) will be implemented by the time we get our hands on moti? I've got a lot to work on haha, just curious.~  Thanks so much for making this its an manifestation of something I feel like I've always needed :3~  I'm left with a few questions as far as how moti will operate on the day to day:~  1.

It's an awesome idea!~  I just have a question:~  How can MOTI tell the difference between similar activities. For example if I want to develop a habbit of drawing daily, how can MOTI tell if I'm drawing or just writing something? Or if I want to drink water daily, how can MOTI tell if I'm drinking water or alcohol or some soft drink?~  Congrats on making it MOTI team!  So excited for this little extra bit of MOTIvation and thanks for your reply Kayla...even though I may be 5 days late ;p~  Joan Hatfield - Also, great suggestion regarding adding an extra layer of positive feedback from users' friends, doctors, trainers, etc. More rewards means more motivation! This social integration is absolutely something we are considering for future MOTIs!~  Joan Hatfield - Definitely! We do see MOTI being used by dentists with their patients.~  jca burchsted  - Aww! We are so glad that MOTI can be a help to you. What is your habit?~  Here's my original post....~  MOTI owners could designate people that could receive email or text notifications from MOTI when its owner completed a habit.  Those people could then enhance the positive feedback loop to increase motivation by commenting back with congratulations.  MOTI owners could designate friends, as well as trainers, physical therapists, etc.  As a trainer, I would love have MOTI as a motivational connection to a client, present when I am not to keep my client exercising and to enable me to know when to cheer my client on with each exercise session.~  Thought some more about my last post....why not market MOTI to dentists trying to get patients to brush and floss, to trainers, physical therapists, etc.  They could be distributors for MOTI...a win-win for your company, the service providers, and the patients/clients.~  tears of relief when I saw this project: I have been looking and looking for something like this!  Thank you!~  What a great way to fuel positive change in your life and in the lives of the one's you love! This will make great stocking stuffers! Cute, meaningful and cute creators of positive change!~  Thanks Stephanie, Ariel, and Collin for the support! We can't wait to get your MOTIs to you.~  Re: multiple users tied to one product, that's a great idea we hadn't thought about yet! You can tie multiple MOTIs to one user, but why not the other way around? I'll bring this up with the software team to see how something like that would work. ~  Best,Kayla (MOTI Inventor and Co-founder)~  Love this idea!  Totally makes sense to have a physical motivator.  That's why there are trainers in gyms ey?  Just wanted to leave some feedback and mention that it would be nice if mulitple users could use the product.~  I realize there are limitations so maybe I just need to pledge for two Moti's but in a tight budget it would be nice to have multiple profiles connected to one moti...not sure how this could be accomplished.~  Love the idea! Who doesn't need a little push to build a new habit? Can't wait for them to ship.~  Super excited about this! I'm so bad at maintaining habits longer than two weeks. Going to use this for long term skin regime at home and drinking water at work.~  ",0,"$50,000","MOTI | Your Smart Companion for Better Habits (Canceled) by MOTI, Inc. — Kickstarter"
293,"We have something to tell you. During these campaign days you have provided us with great feedback and support. Thanks a lot!
We have confirmed that everybody who meets Robobo, falls in love with it. Unfortunately, in this period  we were not able to reach all the potential Robobo fans out there. That’s why we are now closing the current campaign, but just to return with more strength and open it up to the whole world.
Thanks to everyone that supported us and to the Kickstarter team who granted us the honour of being one of their favourite projects.
See you soon, and meanwhile… follow us on:http://theroboboproject.com/ and on our social networks:In the near future, robots will be autonomous, that is, they will be able to carry out different tasks in our society without continuous supervision. As a consequence, some types of jobs will disappear and new ones will arise. What is clear, is that today children, and everyone who aims to be prepared for this new market, must understand how this new type of robotics work. That is, the future of robotics is in education.
The first step towards learning autonomous robotics is having tools that can be used in our homes, schools and labs. Affordable tools with the same technology used in future robots. Is that possible? Well, here is where Robobo comes in!!  Our educational robot combines a simple mobile base with your smartphone to create the next generation of educational robots, where anyone interested in learning how to program an autonomous robot can do it. The Robobo base is the body while your smartphone is the brain.Current smartphones contain the latest technology in terms of sensors, processor and communication capabilities, and together with the mobility, low level sensing and gestural capabilities provided by the base, Robobo becomes the optimal tool to start in this new robotics field. With the gyroscope, magnetometer and accelerometer of your smartphone, you will be able to program Robobo to do simple things that are quite hard to achieve on other platforms, such as, for example, moving to the south!!What about crossing through a balance?Using the tactile smartphone’s LCD screen, the speech production library, the Robobo sounds created by our team, and the PAN/TILT unit, you can create all kinds of human-robot interaction projectsBut you will also be able to carry out much more complex tasks, which other accessible platforms can only dream of, such as recognizing sounds and speech, which is natural to current smartphones and to Robobo. Thus, you can use Robobo to detect, for instance, musical notes and move according to them. This opens a whole world of new types of artistic challenges that can be addressed with the robot, including painting or dancing to rhythms.The smartphone's cameras provide access to a complete new level of projects  and challenges. Robobo can see its world, like you do, so you can use it to solve real life problems. For example, what if we program it for autonomous cleaning and recycling? The world is dynamic, everything moves and changes… The computational power of the processors in current smartphones allow using computer vision algorithms in real time, even using current deep networks. For instance, in the following video you will see how Robobo can follow a moving green ball.Recognizing faces is another high level sensing capability of Robobo that opens a huge range of possible projects of human-robot interaction. This robot can see you!!A new level of robotic tasks can be performed if you consider that Robobo is able to connect to the Internet and it can use the operating system of your smartphone. For instance, you can access weather forecast information, traffic information, send an email, publish a tweet, take a photo or start and manage a video chat.All this technology can be used independently of your programming skill level. You can use from block-based programming with Scratch to more advanced languages through ROS (The Robot Operating System).The Robobo framework is the core of the robot, it implements all the sensing and actuating capabilities of the robot and supports the execution of Scratch and ROS programs via WiFi. The framework is built using the Unity3D engine in order to provide a seamless experience either for Android or iOS users.Robobo appWhat do you need to start programming Robobo? First of all, you need to install our free Robobo app in your Smartphone, and then, connect it to your Robobo base through Bluetooth. Then, you can program the robot using Scratch or using ROS.The Robobo App not only allows you to program Robobo, but also provides utilities to modify the configuration of the robot (language, camera calibration, etc.), update the Robobo base firmware wirelessly via Bluetooth, and start a demo program that shows many of the capabilities of the robot, as shown in the next video:Scratch blocksIf you are interested in block based programming, you can download our free ScratchX extension to program Robobo from a PC or laptop using simple blocks. This programming is carried out through a standard web browser, making Robobo compatible with any operating system. We have developed more than 30 Scratch blocks in this extension that allow you to exploit your Smartphone's capabilities in a very simple way: face detection, color detection, claps detection, speech production, etcTo start using Robobo with ScratchX, we have developed a detailed programming manual that contains detailed information about the Robobo base specifications and the initial configuration of the system. Moreover, it contains the definition of the blocks, together with examples of their use. You can check our programming manual by clicking here.ROS librariesFor advanced users, we have created a wiki page where you can download the ROS libraries and check our reference guide with several configuration examples:https://bitbucket.org/mytechia/robobo-programming/wiki/ROS.md The team behind this project is coordinated by University Professors specialized in autonomous robotics, mechanical engineering and computer science. Moreover, we have been carrying out international research on robotics and intelligent systems for more than 20 years both for academia and industry.Machine learning, evolutionary and cognitive robotics and collective intelligence have been our main research topics, so we are very familiar with artificial intelligence applied to real robots. This broad experience provides us with a clear vision of the appropriate robotic tool to start working in autonomous robotics, independently of the users' backgrounds. In fact, creating such a tool was our main motivation when starting the Robobo development. Robobo includes a set of tutorials (in English and Spanish) to start working and playing and, more importantly, learning in an easy to follow stepwise manner. This way you can familiarize yourself with the building blocks of autonomous robotics and the endless possibilities of this platform.Each tutorial presents a real robotics challenge that is solved. To this end, you can incorporate 3D printed accessories to Robobo through a series of mechanical connectors located on the bottom of the base.These accessories allow carrying out exciting  new tasks. You can plug Robobo to other commercial construction kits (like LEGO, mBot, Mecano...) but you can also design and print your own accessories. The only limit to customizing your Robobo is your imagination!!! Bored of programming line-followers? Or robots that escape from labyrinths? First stage educational robotics has focused on construction kits, simple electronics and solving basic tasks. This was a good point to start, but a new level of robotics teaching becomes necessary. What about programming a robot that can surveil your house or school looking for open doors? Or maybe a robot that can wake you up and tell you the weather today? Would you like to learn how autonomous parking is performed in real cars?At 395 € (345 € if you join us soon ☺), for a robot with capabilities only found in robots that are an order of magnitude more expensive, Robobo is a bargain!!!.Also, Robobo grows with you and your constantly updated smartphone. When you update your smartphone, Robobo will take advantage of its new capabilities, and you will have an improved robot without changing the base.This allows it to be always up to date on sensing, communications and processing technology, providing access to a whole world of apps for the platform, making it a great long-term investment tool for learning autonomous robotics. Can you say that of current educational platforms?  Best paper award at the 8th International Conference on Robotics in Education:Vodafone Connecting for Good Galicia 2017 Award winner:DREAM EU Research Project mention:  http://www.robotsthatdream.eu/1496405795.htmlOUR ROBOBO T-SHIRT: We have 5 different options to acquire Robobo and to support us in this educational project:1- ROBOBO-DEV (295 €). This is our current Robobo version, compatible with Android Smartphones and ready to be shipped before May 2018.

This pack includes 2 Robobo-dev units. This option includes:5- ROBOBO PACK (1495 €). This pack includes 4 standard Robobo units at a lower price, being a great option for those educational centers interested in introducing autonomous robotics that do not need a formalized set of teaching units (included in the classroom pack). It includes:We are an enthusiastic team of engineers, researchers and robotics teachers who deeply believe in the Robobo Project success. Everyday, we put our energy and effort in the improvement of the different aspects of such a ambitious project. Robobo has been under development during the last two years and now our design is complete. From this point, we need you to be part of the project. First, your support will allow to collect enough orders to launch the manufacturing process of the final base version. Second, funds will also be used to develop the app version for iOS so that any smartphone is compatible with Robobo, and for the creation of new example projects and STEAM teaching units. We want to invest heavily on these educational materials and on creating a lively community around Robobo, your support is crucial here too. All of this to make learning of the next generation of robotics easy and fun.  ",MINT,"€3,656",Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on Mar 19 2018,"Using the technology of current smartphones, with Robobo anyone can learn how to program the robots of the future",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,32, It is a really interesting robot.

See latest Update post.  Aire is the world’s first indoor drone for the home, overcoming the limitations of today’s security systems, cameras, and IoT sensors. Aire can fly, so you can see what’s really going on anywhere in your home, keeping your loved ones and your property safe.       Aire alerts you when it detects or hears anything out of the ordinary with its 360-degree sensors.  Launch Aire from your iPhone or Android device to see if it's a false alarm or if you need to call the authorities. Other home monitoring devices just leave you wondering what’s really happening.           Sufficiently advanced technology always looks like magic.  So, we demonstrated it to the press and here's what they had to say:       Want more proof?  Scroll down to find unedited footage of real flights in Real Demos & Prototypes - No Movie Magic.  Noise, downwash and security against hacking were three big objections we heard from people when we started so we made sure to address these in Aire’s design.  Behind every major innovation, there's a lot of blood, sweat and tears. We overcame hundreds of key technology hurdles like designing a new type of drone that's quieter and safer, to using computer vision for indoor flight and auto-docking. Our team includes a key investor in Oculus, a former CTO of Yahoo, a MIT PhD who built micro satellites, a world-class expert in helicopter acoustics and hardware engineers that launched dozens of well-known consumer products.        All-in-One Security and MonitoringWhen docked, Aire is in Watchdog Mode. Aire’s 360-degree flight sensors and microphones are used to detect motion and sound in every direction, alerting you to potential intruders, smoke alarms, or anything else out-of-the-ordinary.  Let Aire stand guard where intruders are most likely to come through.  If any motion or sound is detected, you'll receive an alert and can launch Aire to investigate further.   Investigate Like You Are ThereToday’s alarm systems and home sensors will alert you when something happens in your home, but they can’t tell you what or how serious it is. With Aire, a few presses on your smartphone let you investigate up close, just like you are there in person.With Aire's intuitive smartphone app, simply press forward, left or right to move Aire. By automatically avoiding obstacles you can safely control Aire from thousands of miles away.  Know What's Really Going on Anywhere    ""Grandpa isn’t picking up. Is he OK?""Have elderly parents living alone?Only fire up Aire when you can’t reach grandma or grandpa so they have their privacy but you can still make sure they are OK no matter where they might be in their home.   ""How's my dog doing?""Check up on your loved ones, including the furry ones even if they're in another room. Dog tested.   Never Miss a MomentRemotely join in on special family moments with Aire's live streaming capability, even when you’re away from home.  Aire is more than just a security camera.  With its numerous sensors, powerful computing capabilities and over-the-air updating, Aire is fully programmable.  Here are some of Aire's skills that come out of the box.    Hands-Free PhotographyLet Aire take the pictures so the whole family can be in it. Since Aire is flying, you can position it anywhere for the perfect shot!   ""Alexa, ask Aire to go into camera mode"" — Aire will return to its home, dock and start charging. IFTTT Automation Capabilities - By creating IFTTT Applets, Aire has the ability to interact with IoT devices throughout your home with triggers:  After overcoming the technical challenges of home navigation, photography and home monitoring
were the first skills we taught Aire.Check out some features that are possible with over-the-air updates:At its core, Aire is a self-flying robot platform with a big brain and many sensors whose first applications are security, telepresence and home automation. We packed it with features to support the applications you'll need now and in the future.Features  Raw videos taken with a handheld smartphone and no editing.  Please note though that this is NOT the final production model, so the noise, flight stability and manufacturing quality will all improve significantly.  Enjoy!    Ducted Fan Propulsion - While ducted fan propulsion Unmanned Air Vehicles are nothing new, we have added a few new twists, such as minimizing the visible aerodynamic parts in Aire’s design and reducing the noise profile.        Obstacle Avoidance - A forward-facing 3D Time-of-Flight camera is used to map out the obstacles in Aire’s path. Because 3D cameras can sometimes produce misleading data when confronted with mirrors or extremely matte surfaces, we have added sonar sensors in every axis to supplement the 3D camera to filter out false negative object detections.   Auto-docking and Charging - FLI Charge's patented charging surface allows Aire to charge on contact, meaning you will never have to worry about charging cables or plugging in. Aire doesn't even need to be perfectly aligned after landing for it to charge either.   Indoor Localization - While typical drones today use a simple one camera + sonar optical flow technology, Aire employs multi-camera localization using the same types of computer vision algorithms employed in the ""inside-out tracking"" of AR/VR headsets.     HardwareMechanicalSensorsPerformance     From day one, we knew that manufacturing was key to launching this product. So every step of the way, we worked with our contract manufacturer to make sure we could mass produce Aire. We’ve partnered so closely with our CM that they have even invested in Aevena.     Building Aire requires expertise in a diverse set of fields, so we built the best team from the best people we could find worldwide.

That's a huge lottery ticket right there.~  It's hard to say if they were contacted for such reasons, but the way they dropped this project is quite cheesy indeed. it must be something big.~  Jeff Tseng, The founder and CEO said, ""While you may not agree with our decision, we hope you understand it. ~  Hope you can understand it...

It feels like the failure during the live stream got them demotivated , I'm also interesting to know what kind of opportunity has made them toss aside years of work on this project.~  It's very hard to be respectful and considerate when the project was funded 140% of goal and then the day before it finalizes on Kickstarter, they cancel.  That's just chicken-shit in my opinion.~  Why would you do this?  You already committed to the project scope as stated, tell us what exact ""opportunities"" arose that precluded/prevented you from delivering on this as proposed?  If you had half a brain in your head, you'd use the Kickstarter campaign as R&D and not cancel it.  ~  I'm not sad, I'm mad.  This is BULL.~  It is a bit depressing to see this project being cancelled. I had really high hopes for it!~  I truly hope as well that there will be final product some time in the future that we can support~  I’m bummed to see it canceled too.   Hope the give us backers a chance to get back in if the continue to work the idea~  So sorry to see this project canceled! It would be useful to know exactly the reason for this. I thought we backers were the investors. Are they just taking this project private for ""other"" investors? Were there insurmountable problems with the overall design concept? I don't think so.~  @TaeWooKIM ~  Initially, the Return Home (auto-docking) functionality will work while Aire is within several feet of the dock (i.e. while its sensors can see the dock). In the future, Return Home from anywhere in the house would be possible when Autonomous Navigation (VSLAM) and Virtual Home Mapping are enabled through over-the-air updates.~  Thank you Chris and all our backers for being so supportive! ~  The landing incident involved two issues. Firstly, Aire failed to detect that it had already landed successfully so it kept the propulsion system on, leading it to slide horizontally along the dock surface until it tipped over the edge. This led to the second known issue of how Aire tried to recover itself in an extreme situation (i.e. Aire tilted and falling, while the propulsion system is at minimal power). Addressing the first issue involves improving the robustness of landing detection and the second known issue is already to be addressed in upcoming control system optimization. In any case, Aire’s soft chassis and enclosed propeller kept everything else safe. ~  Rest assured, we are continuing to develop, test, and optimize Aire’s performance, reliability, and robustness in more real-world environments before we ship late next year. ~  We’re glad that you found our Kickstarter Live helpful. Apparently, the Kickstarter Live widget disappears 48 hours after the event. Here is the direct link to the replay:  https://live.kickstarter.com/aevena-aire/live/aire-kickstarter-live~  And by the way... where can I see a replay of the live event? I didn't get to join live but I watched some of the replay the next day here on the campaign site. Now, it appears I cannot find the replay anymore. Am I looking in the wrong spots or did you remove it? If so, it would be nice to repost it (or at least do another live event). I believe it is really important to have transparency with your backers, even if the final docking didn't go quite as planned... the video still had some great information about your team and your product.~  Can you guys comment on the docking mishap at the live event? Obviously, these things happen with prototypes and while it was a bit concerning... I do not see it as a dealbreaker for backing the project. However, I am interested in the cause (and potential fix) for what happened.~  I have been a backer in some failed Kickstarter projects (with very little communication) and am a little leery of investing again... can you please explain your plan and cadence for updating this site? Will you be posting updates weekly? Monthly? I would like to know your vision for this so we can feel confident that you will keep backers in the loop.~  Also, I think the current and potential backers would like to see more content posted to this campaign when available, nothing fancy... videos shot with a smartphone would be just fine. I would love to see this campaign get more funding in the final days! Thanks!~  @Bryan Bach  Great idea! But if it does, it will be expensive.It will also be heavy. Therefore, flight performance will decrease.~  I tried to post a question on Q&A during Kickstarter Live, but it didn't go through well so I could ask you this question.~  Does 'back home' function works with sensors? Or with GPS? Or does it work by retracking using an old route to go back to the charger?~  Any plans to add a screen? Being able to face-time type connection?~  Jsmooth41 on Paxful has paid to promote this campaign on Hypefunder.cf and on twitter @nerdnalist. Thank him by saying ""hi"" to him on twitter @nerdnalist or send him an email at Hypefunder@gmail.com. Good luck with your campaign!~  Hi Djayawarman,~  If you look down at the middle of the page under ""Real Demos & Prototypes - No Movie Magic"" you'll find videos of Aire with sound.  Please note though that this is not the final noise level and it will get a lot better before we ship.  We have prototypes that are SIGNIFICANTLY more quiet.  We are working on some new content to showcase this so stay tuned.~  Thanks for you for your support!~  Best Regards,~  Jeff~  Why there is no noise video. I can imagine how noisy it is while taking birthday party picture. Please dont put the background song. we need to know in reality how it actually works. @Aire @Creator~  Hi Jeff S,~  Great ideas and thank you for your support!  Those are all great ideas and many of them we have on our roadmap already.~  Best, Jeff~  Wow.  Great product idea here.  My cat is going to need some proper training and I might suggest counter measures for cats of a remote controlled laser pointer that Aire could shine on the floor.  Would be good to distract the cat before she leaps on Aire but also could be used for Aire to point at things by remote control.  ~  I’m in for a few $s to encourage this project but the $750 purchase entry point it too much for me.  I’d back for $250 if that was for an actual unit, beta or otherwise.  ~  Your demo looks awesome and I hope this works out.  ~  You have seen what neato robotics has done for room mapping on their vacuums robots I hope.  ~  Few ideas:Return to base, battery life, noise, remote cloud, voice control, noise detection, smoke detection, light/camera, a low power IR motion sensor, laser pointer, loud speaker, strobe light.~  Hi Christian,~  First off, thanks for the kind words!  We very much appreciate it.~  That's really interesting, thanks for sending the information by.  Our team will take a look at it and see if this is something that would work for us.~  Best, Jeff~  @Jeff Tseng: Hi I wanted to ask and make some suggestions for the international shipping. The problem with the international shipping are the customs which in my case would bill me for 30% of the price of Aire.To avoid this, some projects, which do not have their own local distribution service in the different countries, started to use/work with Amazon to distribute their projects. Amazon in that case would not send the project for example from amazon.com but instead send it to their local centers (amazon.de, amazon.co.uk, amazon.co.jp, ...) and distribute it from there.The shipping cost using Amazon was reduce by a good amount and I have never encountered problems with customs.Two of the most recent ones using Amzone where:-Mini Troll: The World's Smallest Resonance Speaker (Kickstarter) (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vibe-tribe/mini-troll-the-worlds-smallest-resonance-speaker…) -Fingbox - Network Security & Wi-Fi Troubleshooting (Indiegogo) (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fingbox-network-security-wi-fi-troubleshooting#/)I hope this helps to make Aire more accessible to international backers.Keep up the great work.~  Viral Videos.  It took time, a LOT of time to edit out the strings and it was really expensive.  J/K.  In all seriousness, this is not CG magic, it really does fly, just not in a common way.  A combination of a propeller generating thrust and vanes acting as a thrust vectoring system, enables it to hover and move.  It's called a ducted fan.  If you want to see proof, scroll down on the page to see all the videos of it being develop.  if you want an overview of a ducted fan, go here:  http://www.avidaerospace.com/technology/ducted-fans/~  Also, to clarify, this is not a flying Alexa.  It never was.  It can be controlled by an Alexa but it doesn't have Alexa built into it.~  Hi CorbinInJapan, we have no immediate plans to integrate this with Siri but we are open to it if it makes sense.  Can you please tell us what you would use this for?~  how long it take to edit out the string holding this thing while its flying around, also less then 20 real comments and over 60 k in funding ? sureee~  https://www.reddit.com/r/shittykickstarters/comments/724rpt/words_fail_me_a_flying_alexa/~  You said that it will be compatible with Alexa, will it also (eventually) be compatible with Siri? Or does the apple sdk not allow that?~  Excellent, I’m sure most of the automation needs could be accomplished by IFTTT or perhaps the Alexa platform... we’ll see!~  Thanks for clearing up the rest of my questions.~  Looking forward to working with you during the beta!~  Hi Chris, Thanks so much for backing us! ~  1. SmartThings integration. We'll consider adding more integration, such as SmartThings, if home automation through Alexa/IFTTT is insufficient to achieve things like turning on the lights and other actions users desire. In any case, we've added SmartThings to our list of potential future features/integrations. ~  2. Beta version. Yes, the plan is for the beta version to have the final hardware but with potentially some remaining kinks in the software/user experience to be worked out. Don't worry, we'll also provide any hardware-related fixes to the beta testers if indeed any of those are found. ~  3. Virtual Home Mapping. Yes, all Aire units we ship are equipped with the hardware (cameras, sensors, processing power) to be ready for this and other potential features listed in the ""New Skills and Capability Updates"" section. It should only take a software-only update to enable it. ~  4. 4K camera sensor. The camera sensor is indeed capable of capturing 4K video. This has been fixed on the page. Sorry for the confusion. ~  Thanks again for your support and feedback Chris!~  And one last question... there are several areas in the campaign where you mention that the hardware has 4k capabilities, but that conflicts with several other areas on the page where you mention that the main camera sensor is only 1080p... can you clarify the camera/video capabilities? Thanks!~  Exciting project, I am glad to back you guys as a beta tester... ~  Smartthings integration would definitely be a welcome feature so it could turn on lights around the house as it navigates... maybe this could be accomplished thought the existing Alexa>Smartthings integration. Not sure if there is an existing pathway through the API that could accomplish that.~  Couple of questions... I backed the beta assuming that beta testers would get a final product functionally and aesthetically, is that correct? In other words, the beta hardware will be functionally and cosmetically identical to the final product... only software upgrades would be required during the final beta testing phases. Will you guys be providing any hardware related fixes to the beta testers if issues are found during that period?~  Also, when you say the first version will not be able to map the home... will that be available as a future software-only upgrade? Or will that only be available in a future hardware revision (Aire 2.0)?~  Looking forward to the beta test and providing valuable feedback!~  Thanks!~  1)  Sorry, I didn't understand the first time.  Thank you very much!~  2)  Ok, I understand now.  To dock with the application with the first version, you need to fly it so that the bottom camera can see the dock (few ft away) then the application will let you click the ""dock"" button and it will automatically dock itself and charge.~  3)  Ok, let us get back to you on the shipping cost.~  1) When you say that this would be the best of products funded by Kickstarter and Indiegogo, are those the number of projects that you've backed on Kickstarter and Indiegogo?-> I already told you. :(  indiegogo: 46 Contributions kickstarter : 11 ContributionsAnyway this is the best product.~  2) Alexa: If Aire is in the same room as the dock, then you can ask it to return home. When we release the first version, it won't be able to map your home so it won't know how to get back unless it's close by.-> I already know, ""back-home""  through the Alexa's voice command I asked if the ""application"" also has a kind of a ""back-home button""Your word is impossible if it is an early product. ??Note that, I sponsored Aevena Aire Robot.~  3) If you're interested, let me know what country-> Korea. Of course, it is Republic of Korea.~  Krok, thank you for pushing us over the goal!  Let's keep going!~  Hi CorbinInJapan, making it a speaker is definitely interesting.  We'll put that on our list of potential future features!~  Hi TaeWooKIM!~  First off, we don't mind the questions at!  Please feel free to continue asking, they are all good questions.~  When you say that this would be the best of products funded by Kickstarter and Indiegogo, are those the number of projects that you've backed on Kickstarter and Indiegogo?~  Alexa:  If Aire is in the same room as the dock, then you can ask it to return home.  When we release the first version, it won't be able to map your home so it won't know how to get back unless it's close by.~  Flight time:  We are working on increasing the battery life beyond 8min.  8min is just what we know we can get with the current prototype.~  Additional Docks:  We can provide additional docks separately for $99 + shipping.  We could do this by an additional pledge of the $99 + shipping.  If you're interested, let me know what country.~  Thanks again!  Feel free to ask more questions.~  I'm sorry to ask you a series of questions.~  Can I purchase the Charging Dock separately?I have a lot of questions and it can be annoying. But please reply.~  The current flight time is 8 minutes.It is too short a time. Are you thinking about securing battery performance?~  I read all the FAQs and Campaigns in my poor English.But my question is not solved, so I will ask you a question.Sorry, please reply.~  Alexa voice command seems possible. but, Does the application have a 'home back' button?~  This would be the best of the products funded by kickstarter and indiegogo.~   indiegogo: 46 Contributionskickstarter : 11 Contributions~  Thank you backers for all your support!~  Boom.  Goal achieved!~  Thanks for the idea CorbinInJapan! Added to our list of additional ideas to consider.~  Just a ""this would be cool"" kind of thought branching off of the other idea below: ~  ability to act as a wireless speaker when docked.~  Hi Robert, I hope I'm understanding your use case properly. When you are flying Aire and see your pet you would like the ability to press a button on the mobile app to have Aire play back some sound that your pet responds to (i.e. leaves the area). Am I understanding your use case?~  I would like it to have some sort of ambient sound playing or an synthetic ""drone"" sound. Alerts Sounds to integrate into my Smarting's HUB. And motivate a pet to leave a certain area.~  Hi Robert, we're so glad that you like Aire's aesthetic! We are aware of the wobbling and are working to fix that by time we ship. As for the speaker, we haven't prioritized on loudness and bass but we are open to considering it. Can you please help us understand how you are thinking of using Aire?~  looks like it wobbles a bit. how loud is the speaker? Looks like a flying subwoofer which I like. Does it have good bass~  ",0,"$50,000",Aire - World's First Self-Flying Drone for The Home (Canceled) by Aevena Aire — Kickstarter

WHY of things; technology is the HOW of things; and art is the MEANING of
things.”-- KEVIN PAGE Artist and InventorEXECUTIVE
SUMMARY: DOTY is a project to build a robot that teaches and inspires K-12 kids
(and adults) about STEAM Education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math). 
Many approaches to capturing kids' interest in STEAM subjects have been tried,
but the DOTY Robot is unique in that it uses science and technology in the CREATION
of art!THE DOTY
STORY: Hello.  My name is Kevin Page and I am the inventor of DOTY
the Painting Robot.DOTY is the
result of years of scientific research and know-how applied to one problem
(pointillist painting) that became a solution to another problem (STEAM
education.)  Here is the story:Several years ago
I was approached by a scientist that had developed a robotics system for making
oil paintings in an arcane painting style called pointillism.Over the next
couple of years, the scientist and I developed a new version of the technology
that took advantage of my expertise with color manipulation in the digital
domain (I had been a documentary filmmaker and digital editor for more than a
dozen years previously.)  We collaborated on the filing of two US patents,
one of which has been awarded and the other is still pending.  At the
beginning, we focused almost exclusively on the technology as a fine art tool
or ""paint brush.""At the same time
as the above story was unfolding, I was made aware by some of my contacts in education
about the burgeoning movement called STEAM in American education.  (STEAM is an
acronym that stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and
Mathematics.)Across the
country, teachers and administrators are coming to similar conclusions: art informs
science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and vice versa. 
Consequently, they are pioneering new methods of teaching that combine
disciplines which have been isolated from one another under traditional
educational models.In short, the
argument goes: American kids aren’t showing much interest in “hard science” at
least as compared to students in other countries.  One solution for this
is to try and change the way we teach all of these subjects in schools.
 STEAM education, in a broad sense, is an attempt to integrate these
seemingly divergent fields into a wider understanding of the world.For some reason,
these ideas captured my imagination and hit me in a very personal way.  I had a
daughter in grade school and had self-educated my way through a number of
different careers by this point, so on some very deep level I “got it” right
away. So the idea came
to me, “Why not use the DOTY robotics platform, which creates art using
science and technology along with an artist’s creative vision, as a way of
teaching by example this fundamental idea of integration?”  I
decided to offer kids an experience of science and art that was similar to what
I went through personally during the developmental journey with my DOTY art
system.  (See related article: “Kevin Page New
Pointillist Painter"")The idea was to
introduce DOTY to K-12 students in the classroom and develop a number of
hands-on activities that would have engaged kids in project-based learning
activities that, in turn, would have been integrated back into the
existing curriculum for science, math and art.We were going to
build the classroom model of DOTY out of brightly colored anodized aluminum. We
even had rough designs.  It was going to be COOL!We made our pitch
to schools, universities, museums and art galleries.In some cases we had a
series of meetings that stretched on for months.  We sat on committees and
gave talks on the subject.But in the end, everybody that heard about DOTY wanted
the product…yet no one, at least where we were looking, had the money to pay
for the product.  The in-class ""push"" model of distribution was
starting to seem unlikely.DOTY the
Painting Robot EvolvesAnd then,
Kickstarter came along.  We decided to build a new DOTY robot
specifically configured for educational deployments in museums and commercial
environments (the ""pull"" model of distribution).  With the
funds that YOU are providing as a backer, we are essentially skipping
the large institutions, that we hope someday will become our customers, and
building DOTY ourselves.  Pure grass-roots social entrepreneurship!We plan to create
materials (that can more easily be distributed to students than an in-class
robotics lab) like a book and series of Internet-based videos that tell the
DOTY story and engage K-12 students on a visceral-level.So if you see us
on social media or happen to visit one of our websites about DOTY and STEAM
education, please support us and help spread the word with a “share” and
“like”.   We are counting on our grassroots friends to help us bring DOTY to the
world.AND we're offering

Any final issues or hiccups along the way, we have an extra month of leeway just in case.JUST TO BE CLEAR - OUR INNOVATION IS NOT NEW HARDWARE.Tooling (the frame, motors, camera, etc) is expensive and runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. We don't have that money. So we are working with manufacturers who have existing hardware molds to edit and modify the electronics and software. There is a working app with video feed that controls the drone. We need to edit the electronics to put our own software on it and increase stability. We feel very confident in our ability to do this.However, there's a chicken and egg problem -  they want a minimum order quantity before working with us on the full schematics, but we can't get a final version of the product to show you on our Kickstarter without having the pre-orders to talk to the manufacturers.That's where you come in. Your pre-orders and backing will allow us to go to the manufacturers, and make this a reality!Working with us is a solid manufacturing partner, and a plan to execute if we reach our Kickstarter goal. We have chosen an experienced intermediary partner to interact with the Chinese manufacturers. John O'Grady has over a decade of sourcing/manufacturing expertise in China, assuring that quality, safe products are made for entrepreneurs. We have shortlisted several factories with existing quadcopter tooling suitable for our needs in the Pearl River Delta area of China. By using a factory with existing quadcopter production, we save a lot of money on the hefty tooling costs, meaning our costs just go toward the PCBs, modified for our purposes with different peripherals. John will help us with this, as well as factory visits, quality control and inspection, negotiating the best price, certifications and licenses to export safe products to the world, and more.No funny business.If for some reason we are unable to deliver your Jackie pre-order after taking your money, we promise that that we will return your money back*. We do this because this is how we would want to be treated, if we were backing someone else's project.

298,"Say hello to EMYS: the lovable social robot who offers a totally new, highly effective way to introduce your little one to a second language in a way that feels just like hanging out with a new best friend!Most parents who want their kids to learn a second language turn to iPad apps, computer games, flashcards, or sitting their little ones in front of TV shows that might feature a brief language-based segment or two. But kids have short attention spans, and anything that doesn’t engage all their senses, or feel truly “real” to them, will offer disappointing results in terms of your child retaining what he or she has been told or shown. We created EMYS to eliminate this challenge, driven by a vision to give parents a way to dramatically empower their kids when it comes to language learning. Now we’re gearing up to expand on EMYS’ capabilities as the world’s most lovable language tutor, starting with a English - Spanish and Spanish - English version. We’d like to develop more language versions in the future (Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean) and we need your support to make it happen!So far, EMYS and our other robotics work have been featured in the following media outlets:  When EMYS’ vision system detects that your child is around he will wake up and start engaging. The playful interactions can range from just plain talking to your child about a particular word to using tags to check knowledge retention or even playing games such as “Simon says” or “Guess who?”. 
The robot can teach new words on it’s own or be coupled with our Smart Tag system to provide even more engagement and fun. The robot can recognize tags representing specific objects and react accordingly or use them as a means of checking knowledge retention. This teaching method provides hours of learning and laughter for kids through playfully interacting with EMYS, as you’ll see in the following video:Each tag is versatile and contains an object that can be used to convey multiple words. However, if you feel that the starting set is not enough, you can get one of the tag sets that will be available in our shop after we launch EMYS. And if that’s still not enough, you can turn virtually anything into a Smart Tag, by placing one of our special computer chip-embedded stickers onto it, as seen here: You know you want your child to learn a second language, and you’ve heard that it makes sense to start them young, but how do you avoid overwhelming your little one - or wasting money on language instruction that he or she may not be ready for? Until now, it’s been hard to know how to give kids the best advantage when it comes to picking up a new language, but we believe that EMYS is the answer!Through our research group with the Wrocław University of Science in Technology, in Wrocław, Poland, we started developing EMYS in 2008, and have been refining him ever since. EMYS expertly guides kids to learn languages, through exciting interactions that infuse joy and magic into each day, while increasing self-esteem.Based on our own extensive research, as well as studies conducted by reputable educational institutions, EMYS solves the issue of language learning troubles by taking things off-screen and into the real world. A recent Yale University study demonstrated that having a physical robot tutor (such as EMYS) increases learning gains for students, and we’ve seen the same thing happen in our tests.Not only is EMYS poised to transform your kids’ self-esteem and sense of fun now, but this endearing robot will lay a solid foundation for their success an increasingly globalized, “melting pot” kind of world, where bilingualism is a huge asset and exciting advantage.EMYS came to be what he is today by virtue of 9 years of intensive research and experimentation into social robotics, and several previous versions. He’s a true labor of love for us, and we’ve been thrilled to see how positively kids react to him - not to mention how easy he makes it for them to pick up one new word per day in a second language. Here are a couple of examples of what people are saying about the fun and learning effectiveness that EMYS delivers:  It’s been proven that learning a foreign language improves kids’ creativity, IQ score, problem-solving skills, and more. The best time for kids to pick up a second language is while they’re still learning their mother tongue - but the problem is, children this age need to be taught in a very specific way in order for their new knowledge to “stick”.EMYS is specifically designed to address the unique learning preferences of kids aged 3 to 7, which is the optimal time to learn a second language. During this phase of life, children’s brains are primed to begin assimilating the meanings of words. But while kids are “sponges” at this age, they need to be taught in a very particular way, leveraging:Something else that sets EMYS apart is his ability to express emotion. Featuring 4 different touch sensing points on his head and body, he is an upbeat companion with whom kids can interact in a completely natural way.He talks, dances, reacts to your child patting or tickling him, and encourages him or her to get up and get moving as he helps little ones to deeply grasp the meaning of new words. His friendly face creates a real connection that helps your child develop empathy, too.And let’s not forget the positive reinforcement that EMYS provides on your child’s learning journey! With each language-learning success, kids unlock new aspects of EMYS’ personality, including dance moves, amusing personas (he can behave like a pirate!), and confirmation of success on his display screen.It’s incredibly easy to get EMYS up and running. Just take him out of the box, power him on, use the accompanying parental app for iPad or Android to choose the second language you’d like your child to learn (English or Spanish), and set your child’s age and current competence level in the second language. From there, the adventure begins!  The first few days of interactions that your child will enjoy with EMYS will be a “getting to know you” period: a chance for EMYS to explain who he is, how he works, and the different ways they can play together.  Gradually, EMYS will begin to teach foreign words to your child, making sure never to overwhelm or confuse. Over time, he’ll integrate the use of Smart Tags to introduce conceptual groups of words - such as color names, seasons, and foods - first in your child’s native tongue, and later, in the second language.Are you a developer with an interest in social robots? If so, we think you’ll find the platform that EMYS is built on to be the perfect launchpad for your own projects! EMYS comes with a full SDK, and the modularity and flexibility of the robot’s software allows for easy development of his capabilities, plus adaptation to new applications.To help you get a sense of what you could do with EMYS as a developer or robotics enthusiast, take a look at what some of our colleagues in the robotics world have said about EMYS:All our backers will receive access to our software development kit, which will allow you to program the robot yourself. However, if you choose the Developer Edition backer package, you’ll also receive unlimited technical support directly from us, the FLASH Robotics team, via an easy-to-use online ticketing system.We can’t wait to meet you and hear about your ideas for what you want to do with EMYS! If our Kickstarter campaign is funded, we will have everything we need to extend what EMYS can do, and deliver to you a new-and-improved robot that will not only be capable of teaching kids a second language through playtime with the EMYS RFID Smart Tags, but also so much more!We are parents ourselves, and we’ve been thrilled by the results kids have gotten so far using EMYS (as well as the way they have reacted to his look and personality), but what we’re truly passionate about is touching as many lives as possible in a positive way through education that feels like fun. That’s where you come in!Note: In addition to what’s listed in the rewards packages above, all backers who choose a package that includes the EMYS robot will receive access to our Software Development Kit, which will allow you to program EMYS. FLASH Robotics is a small, dedicated team of robotics researchers, engineers, designers, and teachers based out of Wrocław, Poland. We’ve spent years building and perfecting social robots, having been inspired by their potential to touch lives as we took part in various studies at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology. We have both applied for and participated in various national and European research projects, which has given us the chance to collaborate with several different interdisciplinary and international consortia. We first developed the EMYS concept in 2009, and over time, our prototypes got better and better, with our software allowing EMYS to operate autonomously and become a believable companion. We are also proud to have developed a full-sized robot called FLASH. It now serves as a research platform at the Robotarium laboratory in Edinburgh. We firmly believe that the right place for a social robot is at home, and after working with robots in laboratories for many years, we came to the conclusion that our technology is ready to make that a reality! That decision led to our setting up a company in order to bring EMYS to market.  As researchers, we didn’t have much entrepreneurial experience, so we were honored to be accepted into the HAX accelerator, in the heart of Shenzhen, China, often referred to as “the Silicon Valley of hardware”. HAX is a highly competitive program that is known to have a lower acceptance rate than Stanford or Harvard.At HAX, we met fantastic advisors and mentors who helped us to develop EMYS into a commercially viable product, and connected us with key players in the Chinese manufacturing ecosystem. Here's a sneak peek at what we accomplished during our time in Shenzhen at HAX:Thanks to our adventures at HAX, today, we are extremely focused on just one task as it relates to robotics: teaching foreign languages, and doing it well! Both our time spent as researchers at the university in Wrocław, and the 4 months we spent in China, made us realize the true importance of learning foreign languages.We are also parents who, like all parents, want the best for our children. We strongly believe that the technology we have developed and transformed into EMYS has the potential to revolutionize language learning for kids, and to improve their quality of life for the rest of their lives. There have been quite a few people and organizations who have helped us along on the way on our journey to bring EMYS to market, and we would like to thank them for their support. We would also like to thank every single one of you who decides to back this project on Kickstarter, as without you, we simply would not be able to make our dream of empowering parents and kids with incredibly effective and fun language learning via robotics a reality!Specifically, we would like to recognize the following organizations:Campaign social media share links:  Please note that the EMYS robot at the beginning is provided with Spanish-English and English-Spanish option. More language options (Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean) will be developed in the future. All our rewards packages that come with an EMYS robot include one year of educational content for little ones to enjoy, which you’ll be able to download to EMYS via the EMYS app for iOS or Android.

CellRobot is the world's first smart modular robot. Assemble it into various forms and control complex movements that no other robot does. Cell Robot is both entertaining and educational.Modular robotics is one of the most complex areas of robotics. Each added element allows new movements. Normally such robot stays in research labs, in places like MIT (link to video). We decided to give access to such cutting edge technology to non-specialists.Of course it has limitations: it's not cheap and it's not fast, you won't fly it around like a drone, it's not yet quite like the microbots ™ in Big Hero 6 ™. Did you know that robots in the movie were inspired by research conducted at MIT on modular robotics and at Carnegie Mellon on soft robotics? Our robots are learning tools: we truly believe they can help learn complex cinematic / combinatory movement, aspects of programming and possibly put their future owners on a path to dive deep into robotics, like we did.If you consider this project like a ""Macintosh moment"" in the field of consumer robotics, you might understand our excitement at bringing it to you. And it's no coincidence our ""CELLs"" look like alien eggs. Because they are ;)Get a glimpse of the future with CellRobot!
We will keep improving the robot, its modules and software until they can not only teach and entertain but also do useful things. We tried to get them to play music, pour a drink, butter a toast and even paint art, but it's still a bit hard for them. They'll need a bit more time to learn how to do that.Just like the cells in our bodies work together to create life and functions, our robotic cells serve as the essential building blocks. Once connected, they can perform various functions, and be manipulated into an endless variety of interesting shapes. The HEART is the epicenter of CellRobot-Supply the power to all the other modules, and is responsible for CellRobot’s connection to your smartphone or tablet.  The CELL is the frame and muscle of CellRobot. Inside each CELL is a servo motor, a sensor and an independent MCU (Microprogrammed Control Unit). Once connected to HEART, each cell can be directed to move in any direction and angle you wish. X-CELLs give the robot its full potential. They act as add-ons to normal cells, allowing the robot to evolve and accomplish any task with the invention of new X-CELLs. Also, we open CellRobot platform for you to create your own X-CELLs. We use a scientific way to make the control of CellRobot simpler. The delicate design of the snap joint makes the connection more convenient and interesting. What you need to do is to make the two surfaces face each other. At this time, you twist them gently and they can be connected firmly. As for the App, we supply two modes, GUIDE mode and CUSTOM mode. Under the GUIDE mode, we guide you to make the shapes listed and help to check whether it’s correct; under the CUSTOM mode, you can create the shape you want and make your own movements. Whatever the mode is, the app can timely recognize the shape and state of your robot, which used to only happen in science fiction until now. This information will be shown through the app in 3D.We are trying to make the control mode of CellRobot to be as simple as possible so that customers of all ages can build and control their own robots. Everyone can share their ideas and be inspired by others’ creations. We hope that CellRobot can offer a new robot every day through the contributions from users. 
Every day, you’ll have a new robot to make or try out.
We’ll open CellRobot platform to hackers and creators from all over the world.
You are welcomed to create more X-CELLs with practical functions through the CellRobot platform.
 In the Shape Library inside the APP, there are preexisting shapes for you to choose from. Each shape is designed carefully by our engineers, to make sure it has a good user experience. You can share your own robot shape with others as well, and also get inspired by what they are making. Since the Shape Library is often updated, you can potentially meet a new robot on a daily basis.Besides, we endow each CellRobot its own characteristics. There are different colors on the joints of CELLs. In the process of connection, the color shows in different positions randomly. Two robots may share the same shape but the positions of the chromatic circles will be different. You can add extra X-CELLs to your CellRobot kit, give your robot more functions and changesBefore we started working on the CellRobot, we had this dream of a robot that could change shape and adapt to its environment: roll under debris to enter a collapsed building, then climb with four legs onto obstacles, or ramp like a snake to explore passages hard to access. Not just a ""Transformer"" but a real shape-shifter. The technical challenges and cost of building modular robots make this vision still somewhat distant, but the Cell Robot is a first step in that direction. It is a fun and educative little robot that gives a first glimpse into the exciting future of modular robotics. We found Kickstarter to be the best platform to find support for this project and guide its evolution. We look forward to feedback and suggestions for the current project and future functions via X-Cells, API, SDK or other software elements. We can’t wait to work with you all on the future of CellRobot.

My son is 13 and Rokenbok has been his favorite ""toy"" since he was five. We have added to it over the years and it has never disappointed. He never gets tired of it. He enjoys programming, and I cannot wait to see what he will do one day when combining robotics, programming and Rokenbok! We have always felt that the Rokenbok system is the most under-appreciated toy on the planet! Good luck!-Tracy P.~  My son found Rokenbok on youtube. He is obsessed and has been begging for them. Cant wait for these to fund and be shipped! :)~  We have owned Rokenbok for years and over the years have expanded our collection.  They are the most robust building system I have ever worked with and easily stand up to the abuse my 5 children can give it.  It's not as complex as for us to put together as a lego system but not oversimplified either.  My 18 year old to my 2 year olds have all enjoyed our existing system and we are excited to try out the robotics version.~  We are a family of three in the Atlanta, Georgia area. Our now 3 1/2 year old son introduced us to Rokenbok about 9 months ago, and we have had an amazing time watch him learn, play and start to design. He has come a long way in using the controllers for our vehicles, and loves to spend as much time as he can working with our set. ~  Personally, I have been into building and creating personal electronics with bit Raspberry Pi and Arduino, so when I saw this project that combined several of my favorite things - family, creativity, building, programming and robots! - I just had to jump on board. ~  Our son loves learning how things work, the cause and effect of actions, and has spent a good deal of time with me building circuits. This will be an amazing platform for him to grow into, and for the three of us to continue our Maker journey.~  We have been a Rokenbok family since 1997.  We have watched our children learn valuable lessons of perseverance  and creativity.  Now their children are making the same discoveries.  Thank you Rokenbok for making this set of grandparents so glad to pass along our love of your creating.~  Hi There! I wanted to do THREE pledges - two at the $49 level, and one at the $99 level. That doesn't seem possible?~  Will the construction parts in the kit be molded or 3D printed?~  Wow! What an awesome way to add a modular construction system to an Arduino compatible programming system! I bet you could use the light module with light sensor to make a basic color sensor.

303,"We truly love Robotics! Although it's one of the most enjoyable and exciting fields, it is also really challenging. The challenge comes from the need to understand different areas of science like electronics, computer and mechanics. Playing games is really fun too, so we thought it would be a great idea to have the best of both worlds.WiSoccero is designed to take advantage of the exciting art of robotics by removing all of the struggles involved and adding a little more fun. It helps you enter the world of robots with as little difficulty as possible.You can start by just playing with your friends and travel to incredible areas and learning about robots. You can even create your own amazing robotic projects.WiSoccero is agile and versatile. Unlike traditional RC Cars, it can move in any direction without any hesitation. It employs a special wheel arrangement and omnidirectional wheels which gives it a lot more freedom in maneuvering.This soccer-playing robot is capable of kicking and passing the ball. It utilizes an electromechanical part (solenoid) and the necessary electrical drivers. This system is capable of kicking the ball with different levels of force that can be controlled effortlessly.WiSoccero needs to be powered by 3 Li-ion 18650 cylindrical rechargeable batteries (at least 2200 mAh in capacity) that will last for about 2 hours under normal conditions.                                                                                     WiSoccero is equipped with a WiFi module (WiLoader). This wireless module lets you control and even reprogram your robot over WiFi. We've written a small computer program in order to control the robot through WiFi. Joystick commands will be interpreted and then sent by this software. We've tested many types of joysticks and the best ones have been chosen. For easier use and having to avoid wired connections, we've decided to provide you with a customized WiFi joystick kit that includes a Xbox 360 wireless controller shell. Assembling the joystick DIY kit will be an interesting experience. This way you will only need a joystick and 2 standard AA batteries; you will no longer need a computer.                       WiSoccero is based on ATmega2560 core and it has all standard Arduino Mega Headers. It is equipped with WiLoader for WiFi programming and communication. It also comes with a lot of great components for hobbyist and developers like three DC motor drivers, Gyroscope (for orientation setting), DIP switch, buzzer, two LED Strings, two configurable buttons, power and protection circuit, two rocker switches for turning circuit and motors on/off separately, isolated voltage booster circuit and power transistors for kicker mechanism.                                                               WiSoccero uses some IO pins by default for driving motors and performing other necessary tasks for playing soccer. However, we designed the entire circuit in a way that can be used as a development board for other projects too. Each component can be disconnected from the core by removing corresponding SMD jumpers. Also there are male headers on each module IOs that allows developers to use them in any way they need.WiSoccero is truly developer friendly. Thanks to its Arduino compatible headers and component placement, it's possible to use any Arduino Mega shield such as distance sensor shield for obstacle avoidance, camera shields for autonomous operations and much more. Also you can use all these amazing shields while playing soccer. It's truly fun!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A soccer player needs to catch and control the ball. So to accomplish this task, we've looked for different mechanisms. After some brainstorming and actual testing we've found the best and most straightforward way in using magnetic force.We've attached a small and strong neodymium magnet to WiSoccero's front side. As for the ball, any kind of light and magnetic ball can be used. We've chosen Styrofoam Balls which are light, easy to draw on, and most importantly magnetizable by just sticking several steel flat head pins inside.We'll include a couple of balls and several steel flat head pins in WiSoccero's pack. You can simply stick these pins in the balls. Afterwards, color it in anyway you want and make it your own. This way you'll have a customized light magnetic ball. Have fun designing the DIY Styrofoam Ball!                                            Have you ever thought of programming wirelessly ?    WiLoader is the answer. But HOW ??? WiLoader easily connects to your WiFi network, then you can program your AVR, Arduino boards and Robots. It doesn't need any kind of cable for computer connection, especially those huge old USB ones. Because it employs WiFi, even your smartphone can be used to configure, communicate, control and monitor your targets via a WiFi-UART bridge.                   WiLoader is easy to set up, use and control. Since Arduino is an open source software and also has a lot of cool features and rich libraries, we will release a software patch for Arduino IDE to support and handle all WiLoader capabilities. WiLoader can be chosen like any other programmers inside the Tools menu. It is compatible with all operating systems and it performs flawlessly. WiLoader has a WiFi-UART bridge called WiCOM. You can send and receive serial data over WiFi by connecting WiLoader dedicated serial pins to AVR UART pins(RX, TX). Just like other COM ports that Arduino serial monitor uses for communicating and debugging MCUs.           Nowadays smartphones have become an important and fun part of our lives. Therefor we thought why not connect WiLoader to them as well ?! With this connection not only you can set up WiLoader but also you are able to chat with your device via its app. WiLoader app is developed for both iOS and Android phones.  

You can use WiLoader app’s setting tab to configure its parameters such as scanning and connecting to desired WiFi network , choosing URAT port baud rate, naming your programmer and … We will release mobile apps source codes, In order to make it simpler for you to create custom apps . So enjoy this smartphone connection and create anything you want. It is going to be an amazing journey.         WiLoader is designed to fit on Arduino boards perfectly, so there is no need for any kind of cables or jumpers to connect WiLoader to the ICSP programming pins. Putting them together is really easy and straightforward, you just have to align the ICSP header with its counter parts on WiLoader. WiLoader is capable of a lot more than only programming Arduino. You can use its WiFi-UART bridge for creating startling projects, in order to use all of its capabilities WiLoader connects to Rx/Tx pins (UART pins) on Arduino too. You don't need wires or jumpers to couple its UART pin; when you put WiLoader on ICSP headers its serial pins will fit Arduino Rx/Tx pins without needing any further attention or care. Furthermore, since you might want to use shields with Arduino, WiLoader comes with extension headers for them too. You can enjoy working with any shield compatible with your board without any hassle. So in short, WiLoader is designed in a way that you can enjoy Arduino and its shields even more.         WiLoader can help you reach all the things you desire. If you are developing a product and you need to upgrade its firmware or change the programming but it is too heavy to move every time, if it’s somewhere too hard to reach, if it needs to be installed in a specific spot, if it’s a drone or robot that is too exhausting to catch each time or even if it’s some old design that you just have to update; Well, WiLoader is the key. Because it’s a wireless programmer, it doesn't need a physical connection to your computer. As a result, it can program your device when it’s moving or too far and hard to access . You can even use WiLoader, when you don't even see the target yourself. So, WiLoader will help you reach everything you want and it will make developing quite more enjoyable for you.

              These days, we are using more and more accessories and devices and each of these useful tools needs some sort of computer connection to work, mostly they require a USB port. The problem is that laptops and PCs have limited number of ports. As computer become smaller, sleeker and more compact the number shrinks too. Well, now you have one less connection to worry about and one more USB port to enjoy, because WiLoader doesn't need any physical connection to your Notebook, Laptop or Desktop computer. So, it frees up a USB port and adds one more handy device to use.

                WiLoader uses WiFi for connection to computers, smartphone and other devices. It can connect to any existing network with just a few simple steps. So, WiLoader doesn't stop you from using the internet or anything connected to your network. Also, even if you don't have a WiFi network or for some reason you need another network for WiLoader, it is capable of creating one for you. You can rename its network and set its password. No matter what the situation is, WiLoader is ready to go.                  We are a newly formed group of electrical, computer and systems engineers. Our goal is to break new grounds in Internet of Things (IoT) and create innovative products to elevate the quality of all our lives.  

The reason for choosing Petunia Tech as our company name is the reproductive process of this flower. The petunia pollination is quite like communication methods used in IoT and the way various elements interact with each other inside its network.  

We are working in several IoT related fields and have multiple products in different stages of development.

Seriously? Well that is disappointing.~  I am also disappointed that you canceled with 11 days and a few hundred dollars to go!  You're backers spent time looking at your campaign trying to figure out you're confusing pledges, deciding which pledge is right for them, and paying.  It's not that we didn't have anything invested already. I even sent messages trying to figure out the robots and trying to get you guys to put more details on your campaign.~  Well wiloader was self sufficient for robotics, sorry to hear about cancellation. earlier ESP was the only hope with wifi, but wiloader should have ease the way Arduino is controlled.~  Cancelling this project just a few hundred $ from its goal seems incredibly dumb.

We do not just build robots for BattleBots. For KurTrox, it is more than just robots, we are building a community. We seek to empower the younger generation and help to lay the foundation of success for them in the STEAM world. Why? Two simple reasons. It was done for us and we want to see it full circle. They are our future and we want to teach them the knowledge and skills to build a better world and thrive in the STEAM profession. 

We do this though multiple outlets. We mentor  two FIRST robotics teams; SPAM Team 180 and SLC Robotics Team 6225.  We help the students design and build a robot in 6 weeks and then complete it at regional and championship competitions. We have been involved with FIRST for over a decade. 

KurTrox hosts multiple Small Bots of Mass Destruction (SBoMD) combat robot events throughout the year. SBoMD is a combat robotics tournament which hosts 150g to 15lb robots.  Our events are a huge success for introducing the STEAM world to those that are unaware. At each event, our new builders and our audience numbers keep growing. This proves that we are making an impact!

Team KurTrox is a founding member at Treasure Coast Makerspace, where your only limitation is your imagination.  Treasure Coast Makerspace is a premier makerspace that collaborates with schools to enrich the STEAM/STEM community for our area.  In our spare time we also like to build 250 pound combat robots! The robot is what sparks the flame for the STEM world. Entertaining the younger generation through the world of combat robotics makes the connection for the STEM program application and forms a bridge for imagination. Quickly becoming a household name, BattleBots is a prime-time television series on ABC (S1&S2) and now Discovery (S3) in which competitors design, build and operate a remote-controlled robot in an arena, combat elimination tournament. The robots battle in front of a live audience in a series of 3 minute matches that end in either a knockout or a judge's decision.

BattleBots showcases the next generation of combat robots- bigger, faster, and stronger than ever before. Hundreds of the world’s top teams applied to compete at BattleBots Season 3, including teams from Australia, Brazil, Europe, Canada, New Zealand, China and the US. Only 56 where selected. 

Each episode draws 4-5 million viewers in the US alone. BattleBots Season 1, 2 and now 3 have coverage in more than 150 countries.   Axe Backwards is a 250lb combat robot. It has been designed and is currently being built out of bulletproof materials. Axe Backwards has a massive drum spinning weapon that spins at over 4,400 revolutions per minute, designed to disintegrate its opponents. The two axes behinds the weapon are designed to spring forward, upon impact of the drum, and disable the opponent from overhead.  KurTrox - Electronics Engineering has its very own combat robotics team. We all met through our mutual love making rad things, the STEM/STEAM community, and combat robotics. We are Engineers, Technicians, Fabricators, Mentors, and Students.  We have been involved in combat robotics for over two decades as  competitors,  mentors and students. Our passion started with FIRST robotics. FIRST empowered us to work with our community set the foundation for our career choices in the Engineering STEM profession. Our Team is still heavily involved in the FIRST Community. We have come full circle and now continue to empower young minds for the STEM/STEAM world, because they are our future. We mentor two FIRST Robotic teams, SPAM Team 180 and SLC Robotics Team 6225.  We are located in the Treasure Coast of Florida and we work directly in our MakerSpace. We travel all over competing our robots. Our Team recently went as far as Sanya, China to compete in Fighting My Bot - World Cup.So this is the part where we ask for money. Remember you are not just giving us money to build a robot in our garage. You are sponsoring a movement, a community, the STEM culture and outreach to our youth. We are more than just robots and we are empowering our youth to embrace STEM! Our team has been given the perfect opportunity to extend our reach world wide! We need your help to do this, become apart of our community and join the STEM movement!

305,"Hello, we'd love your support to build a DC motor controller. When we were prototyping our axial flux electric motor* we could not find a suitable motor controller to carry out basic testing. Everything seems to be either motor specific, not configurable, incapable of handling high currents or horrendously expensive. We'd like to modify our existing 2-channel controller so that it can run brushed DC motors and 3-phase brushless motors with a square drive wave. The POWER BRICK is being designed in England, will also be built here and is an Open Source Hardware project.The input voltage range will be 12v to 24v and we are planning to add the option to feed the logic side separately. This should enable you to use higher voltage rated key components and run your motor at more than 24v. Naturally we cannot vouch for the safety of running it above 24v and you should only do this if you really know what you are doing. This controller will be able to supply your motor with at least 10A continuous and a far higher short time peak load.The POWER BRICK will work stand-alone, but if you prefer you'll be able to hook up your Arduino™, Raspberry Pi™, MicroPython™ or similar board to control the controller.We will use online surveys to ensure the most popular choices are made and maximise user benefits.*In an axial flux motor the magnetic flux field is parallel to the rotor shaft. This allows high torque motors to be designed when width is restricted. In the more common radial flux motors the field is perpendicular to the shaft.From the picture and video of our 2-channel controller you can see that no heatsinks are fitted. It was designed to run 10A on each channel. As the PCB runs very energy efficiently and the quality components were properly sized, none of the components overheats. In fact you can touch all components without burning your fingers. This is important as we want the power from your battery to go to your motor and not turn the controller into an electric heater. For this to be possible at we will be using 6 MOSFETs with a very low on resistance. To get these at an affordable price we will have to buy at least 5,000 off. In the video you can also see the calibration routine running. During motor set up you can activate this routine to ensure that the controller makes best use of the input signals from the Hall sensors of 3-phase brushless motors. This enables misalignment of the Hall sensors to be corrected, thus optimising the running of the motor, and you can then set an additional parameter to add phase advance. In fact there are loads of other parameters you can set to tailor the controller to your application.June 2014: Finalise financial budgets and evaluate online survey to maximise user benefits.July 2014: Build 2nd prototype board and test logic input circuits, power capacity and user interface. Order microprocessors and MOSFETs.August 2014: Complete testing and establish test procedure for finished product. Order PCBs and remaining components. Plan for pledge fulfilment.September 2014: Write user guide. Ship early rewards.October 2014 onwards: Ship remaining rewards in order of pledge date.You'll be able to use the controller to power your electric bicycle motor and it will interface with crankshaft torque sensors, brake switches, twist throttles, Cycle Analyst™ and other hardware.The POWER BRICK would also be ideal for school projects on small electric vehicles and general lab use.Other applications would be in robotics where you'd like to control a powerful motor or for mobility projects where you could hook up two or more controllers for the drive unit. Please just remember to size your cables correctly to ensure that they can handle the current! With a fully charged 24V battery you'll be able to draw in excess of 500W peak and 240W continuous.As we are offering the rewards worldwide you might be responsible for paying additional charges due to things such as local sales taxes and import duties on receipt of your reward. Unfortunately we've no control over these and can't advise on specific charges. In the past we've sometimes had to pay about an additional 5% for electronic items bought in the USA and shipped to the UK. We are planning to Airmail rewards and the small packages should weigh only about 100 to 150g.For deliveries in the European Union all taxes and duties will have been paid.We are a small company with limited resources and want to be sure the products we make are wanted. After all just because we are convinced that there is a need for a high efficiency, high quality, high current universal DC motor controller doesn't mean that there is one. Creating a product this way not only ensures that it can be done very cost effectively, but also enables you the end user to have a say in the specification. Ultimately the result is a more useful and affordable quality product.Due to the large component order quantities required to manufacture these controllers at a reasonable price, we might not be able to make more after successful completion of the Kickstarter project.To make the most of this project we not only need you to pledge, but also need your input. Let us know what you want to use the universal controller for, feel free to make suggestions (or criticisms), ask technical questions and recommend the project to friends and colleagues who might be interested. High user participation will enable us to build the best possible POWER BRICK.Let's make this happen.",Pablo Engl,£376,Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on Jun 9 2014,"Open source hardware DC Motor Controller kit for brushed/brushless motors.

306,"The Make-A-Pede is a project that has been brewing for some time.  It was first conceived when we were working on projects for a Maker Faire.  In our booth we had made several robots and other projects all out of salvaged stuff. The original Make-A-Pede (which didn’t have a name at that time) was made from various salvaged components found at thrift stores and our local makerspace. It was controlled by an Arduino Nano and a home-made motor driver board. As we were building it, we saw this robot as having real potential as an educational robotics platform.
 
The Make-A-Pede has come a long way since then.  We have made numerous design changes and improvements along the way, and have had many opportunities to field test the robot through maker events and robotics classes. The Make-A-Pede is completely open source.  Our vision for the Make-A-Pede is that it is a community project.  We want makers of the Make-A-Pede to join our forum, post their successes, their challenges, and their ideas for improvements.  We want to see what creative things people have done with their Make-A-Pede.  We’ve tried to make the robot versatile so that beginners and experienced users alike can learn and have fun with it. As an open-source platform, makers can already download the plans to build their own Make-A-Pede.  This requires experience using and access to some specialized tools including a 3D printer and laser cutter.  Our goal for this campaign is to get the funding to create Make-A-Pede kits so that anyone can easily build a Make-A-Pede in their home or classroom without needing access to these specialized tools. Advanced users can enjoy the kit as well, since it provides an easy and versatile starting point for experimentation and development. What sets Make-A-Pede apart from other robot kits is that it is based on a segmented chassis design, giving the robot a centipede-like motion and allowing the robot to be easily expanded.  Segments are driven using pairs of motorized “legs”, and can carry a variety of different modules.  The Make-A-Pede can be controlled over Bluetooth using our smartphone app, or can be programmed to operate autonomously.
The Make-A-Pede is not intended to be finished once it is assembled. Instead, it is designed as a community-driven project that is constantly evolving with new features and improvements. Our hope is that after you build your Make-A-Pede, you will join our forum to find new project ideas and to share your experiences.  Whether you are adding sensors or doing advanced programming, you will be helping to inspire others to take the Make-A-Pede to the next level.
Project Possibilities We are currently working on instructions and tutorial videos to make it easy for anyone to get started with the Make-A-Pede.  These will be available shortly following the campaign. SegmentsThe primary component of the Make-A-Pede is the segment.  There are two types of segments: head segments and body segments.
The head segment is driven by a pair of DC motors with rubber rollers and has a 6xAA battery holder, a 9V battery holder, and an adjustable sensor mounting point (for a distance sensor, camera, display screen, etc.).Body segments can either be driven by a pair of DC motors with rubber rollers, or fitted with a pair of passive, non-motorized rollers. Each body segment has 4 mounting holes in a 50mm square that can be used to attach one module.Both types of segments contain space underneath for wire management and are connected together end-to-end using pivoting joints.  Segments will be shipped flat and must be assembled with included hardware.  See the sample kit photos below for more detail.
ModulesModules connect to the top of segments using the 4 mounting holes and can consist of a variety of different mechanical or electrical components.Constructing A Complete RobotBuilding a Make-A-Pede requires a minimum of three segments: a head segment, a body segment with a microcontroller module, and a body segment with a motor controller module.  The kit intentionally requires building and wiring. The standard kit also includes a segment with a mini breadboard and an empty segment. More segments can be added to give space for more modules. All of the Make-A-Pede’s features can be easily programmed using the Arduino IDE and the Make-A-Pede programming library.  An Android smartphone app allows the robot to be remote controlled via the Arduino 101's built in Bluetooth LE.  The app will be expanded with more features in the future, and an iOS version is coming soon.

307,"**** UPDATE ****Plobotics is an Open Source project based on a high-tech robotic platform. While the main focus is to play, the learning process and abilities developed are not comparable to any other virtual-only game. We tested it in hundred of workshops and we are sure about the way that kids fall in love connecting cables and using physical cards to program functions. The same ones they would have to be absorbed by a screen, but in real life. We are also sure about how effective it is for parents to see their children engaged with a physical device again. And curious. And challenged.  This campaign tried to communicate that terrific experience. We might have overdid it with cartoons and music but it was with the mere intention of showing the real fun we have teaching. And learning. And trying.We are going to make the video again and change a bit the rewards offered to express better what is that magic we have found and we want to share. In any case, thanks for your support and please follow us in order to get the source files and build together better education technology.****  see more at http://multiplo.org and http://plobotics.org ****Adopt a PlobotPlobotics is an EdTech game that we invented when we were teaching robotics to children.Plobots invite the player to connect the electronics and learn simple programming through Training Cards. All of the necessary electronics come with the set, without the need of computers.
The
Plobot is a level-by-level assembly kit that empowers kids
technologically, and stimulates them to think out of the box, create
and innovate.Get your Plobot trained 
The
Plobots’ progressive learning structure is inspired by the team’s
tests in workshops with children from all around the world. Training
cards include graphical step-by-step instructions to ease new users
into coding. Plus, users will also find online documentation written
for kids, parents and educators.FLet’s
see an example for a Plobot Level 1: “Song Training Card 1” shows
detailed instructions about how to connect a Plobot and how to
program a speaker to play different notes. To operate it, the user
just needs to wave one of the “TONE” smart cards in front of the
Plobot, and then execute it with the “GO!” card.Learning while overcoming Challenges 
Once
users are properly introduced to the Plobots’ coding structure,
their new abilities are strengthened with the Challenge Cards, using
and recombining skills to achieve more complicated goals. The cards
offer varying tiers of difficulty, targeting different ages and
levels of experience. Following the example above, beginners will
have to play a few tones; intermediate users will be asked to make
their Plobot play a chorus, and advanced ones will be challenged to
make the Plobot into a musical instrument that plays tones when
sensors are triggered.Technology that doesn't bite
Plobots
are indeed programmable toys that can be expanded into different
levels. Every level comes with hardware, a quick set up guide,

Plobotics
is a new approach to computer science. The Training Cards offer a
very gentle introduction, designed for young users with no
programming experience.
Plobotics
is a very interesting syllabus. Challenge Cards can be used by
educators to evaluate the progress of their students’ abilities and
open the door to software programming. But also by parents, to have a
great time with their children.Plobotics
has no ceiling. Users, parents and educators can explore as much as
they want, and attach a limitless number of sensors and motors to
build any project in mind. This combination of accessibility and
open-source flexibility is unique among EdTech toys. Avid learners
will be able to exchange unlimited creations and stories within the
Plobotic universe.

color do you like?
As
a stretch goal, we will make different color options, lesson packs
and accessories that we will be unveiled during the campaign. Our
road map includes WIFI, Apps and an online platform.Where do Plobots come? Where will they go?Our team is trying to use Plobots as a way to shift kids’
attention into more interesting options than video-games played in
tablets. 
We are Multiplo, the team that successfully crowdfunded an
Open Source Robot Prototype Platform, Multiplo N8, in 2012. We
believe in EdTech as a source of innovation into our education
system. Our experience teaching robotics to young children brought us
here and now we need your help to get it as a finished product on the

309,"This is a Robot Arm with 5-axis range of motion allowing movements similar to assembly line robots. It was designed to offer the highest quality while remaining one of the most affordable robotic arms on the market.Three years ago, we created MandleBot, a 5-axis aluminum robotic arm currently being used in schools, robotics clubs, summer camps and even factories. We have enjoyed sharing our passion for robotics with a lot of people and it has inspired us to now do it on a larger scale.
My team and I wanted to create a robotics experience that would be available to anyone interested in this hot and futuristic subject, whether just starting out or already quite experienced. Our goal has been to create a robot that meets our exacting quality standards while remaining affordable.Another goal was to create a robot that could be used in schools to motivate students to learn more about science, engineering and robotics. Such a robot needs to be highly functional, configurable and visually appealing. The kit includes: a black and clear acrylic body with a set of screws, nuts and standoffs, six high torque servomotors, a bearing base, Arduino with Servo Shield, wiring, USB cable and a power supply. You also get the standard gripper head module, a Robotic Studio license and the Assembly Manual.
Everyone who orders a robot will receive a free Robotic Studio license. Robotic Studio functions with Microsoft Windows only. This software is the result of thousands of hours of development by my team and I. It enhances what you can achieve with the robot by executing complex automations that would otherwise be impossible to do manually. Robotic Studio allows you to move the robot with a game controller and execute different series of recorded steps. You can connect up to 10 robots at the same time in Robotic Studio to create amazing automations.
There is a wide selection of add-ons you can choose from to add to your bundle. Several head modules are available such as the pen, the advanced gripper, and the palletizer head. They can be added to your Maximo individually if they are not included in the reward you choose.Assembling the 225 parts of the arm is an easy process. In fact, the only thing required to build the robot is a Phillips-head screwdriver. We provide a simple step-by-step guide to help you build it. Even a beginner can put Maximo together and get it to work in less than three hours.In order to bring more features, we’ve created several modular heads. These heads can be changed within seconds. They were designed to be easy to install and remove.The Standard gripper head module is the head included with every Maximo kit. It works like a pair of pliers, with the jaws opening and closing to grab all kinds of objects.
The Advanced gripper head module is more sophisticated than the standard claw and allows Maximo to grab objects by applying balanced pressure to the object. Very useful for grabbing small and rounded objects.
The Palletizer head module is a miniature reproduction of the ones used in factories and warehouses. A must-have to raise small wood pallets and other stuff.
The Pen-holder head module allows you to put various objects on Maximo’s head. You can use Maximo to draw, paint and even play music!
All parts of the robot are engineered to allow customization. Part sizes are meant to be compatible to allow different configurations. It’s simple to add more features to the arm by fixing additional components to its surfaces. For example, a webcam can easily be attached to Maximo to capture some cool footage from the perspective of the robot. 
As an Educational Tool, this robot is a great way to introduce children to robotics and help them discover technologies that are currently used on assembly lines.By using our robot, children will develop useful skills for the future since science and technology are now such key parts of everyday life.

We have created a special pledge for teachers, you could ask your local charity organization (Optimist International, Lions Club, Knights of Columbus, etc.) to help them finance the purchase of the robots for your school.We have two curriculums created by an Educational Adviser for middle and high school students. Each curriculum includes 15 exercises to carry out using our robot.

310,"Thank you so much for visiting my Kickstarter project proposal page. My name is Donald Dixon and I am passionate about my work in robotics.I am developing a very exciting Educational-Home and Entertaining Character Robot with an Artificial Intelligence Conversation Program for children. I call this robot Alpha. The concept of Alpha and the A.I. software has been under detailed development and refinement over a number of years and will be a breakthrough in home robotics. I am seeking financial assistance to complete the project. Kindly read the project details that follows or contact me and I will answer any questions you may have.Alpha is an unique Artificially Intelligent Character Robot capable of Emotional / Facial Expressions and Interactive Learning from the people he communicates with. The robot is soft-bodied, mobile, fluid animation and stands approximately 3 feet. Alpha's mobility will be achieved by a unique All Terrain Mobile Platform and communicates by Speech Recognition Technology. The robot's features and personality are based on the Robotic character in the graphic novel called Alpha and the CreatureBots. The story is set in the near future and from a point of view and wonder of Alpha's (The protagonist) child-like digital mind. Throughout the story Alpha has learning experiences and adventures with new friends he meets while discovering the world around him.The Alpha Robot is targeted for elementary school level children at home or in the classroom. The Alpha Character and image will be featured in activity books a well as the interactive media content on Alpha Robot touch screen chassis display. My plan is to market the Alpha Robot (and his image) with educational content to schools and private institutions while also marketing an Alpha Robot specifically designed for home education and entertainment for the family. With your help in pledges or goodwill I can complete the first working prototype of this concept. following completion of the prototype I will produce a production manufactured version for marketing.With the project successfully funded and prototype completed I can use the Alpha Robot prototype to test the market interest by attending trade shows in both the home robotic and educational industries and seek partners. I would gratefully appreciate any advice and opinion from you generous folks who pledge their interest or good will.Current status of the Alpha Robot prototypeThe A.I. software has been developed over a number of years and has been an ongoing project but the current version is ready for Beta testing. The Chassis, Skin and Mobile Base are Done. Although, Work yet to be done are Electronics, Computer system, Sensors and displays. As you can see from the image above on the right The Alpha Robot Eyes and Touch Screen (Task to Complete) are placed on the skin / chassis part (Which has been Completed). I did this to give you folks some idea how close the Alpha the Robot will resemble to the image of the Alpha Graphic Character when the project is completed. Also the Omni-wheels (mobile base) will to be re-made from 3D printer. The Mechanism for the mouth / lip articulation is in design right now, the eyes and eyelid were originally mechanical. However, on this updated version of the Alpha robot prototype I will use LCD displays instead that will enable Alpha more variety of eye expression through animation. Once funded I will be able to complete all outstanding issues fairly quickly.          Alpha Robot version #1 prototype that was used for testingThe following image and video clip is of the original breadboard prototype made of Alpha (Alpha Robot version #1 prototype) used to develop the A.I software and test some facial expressions methods. I wanted to pull Alpha out off the imaginary story and into the real world as realistic as possible..This smaller and slightly different version of Alpha (Clip & Photo above) was not intended for production design nor did it resemble the original character from the graphic novel. It was developed and used to create the Artificial Intelligence software facial expression Technics. This year I am reconstructing Alpha as I originally designed based on the robotic character in the graphic novel Alpha & the CreatureBots.                    Rendition of the Alpha Robot being madeThe Alpha Artificial Intelligence Software is a sophisticated natural language processor in a unique method which brings Alpha to life with personality. Alpha is among a product line I am creating called ""Creaturebots"". All will have this software.The following video clip is a brief example of my Artificial Intelligence conversation method and techniques. For fun and to show how smoothly the lip sync works while speaking I used my video realistic head to more clearly demonstrate. The voice of Alpha the robot will be Child-like. This program was version 1 and has since been upgraded for the Alpha Robot. A version of this program will be sent to merit pledges. (Sorry about the sound quality)(Please read Details in the A.I. CONVERSATION PROGRAM (BETA) Reward section).The following photos are of Alpha chassis and skin in the making: This clay model was created to make the foam latex Image of Alpha.  Unique unidirectional mobile base wheels and shell cover. Getting image adjusted. The challenge to make it functional as well Miniature test model for reference before making actual size Measuring up the original Alpha's Mechanical head to the replacement Me and Yang Sun Young (Who co-wrote Alpha & The Creaturebots) Once the goal of raising funds to complete the Alpha Robot prototype are reached my scheduled plan is to get a production version of the Alpha robot made. The funds for the prototype will be used primarily to:The A.I. conversational software is ready to install for Beta testing once the robot hardware is completed. Work needed to get the robot completed is the functional and inner workings of the project (particularly facial mechanism). With success of raising funds for the completion of a working prototype (within 40 days) I will then proceed on constructing the production version of Alpha based on specs from the completed prototype. The prototype mechanically and cosmetic (skin) are done (as shown in the photos), Electronics for the prototype will be modals off the shelf components, After testing the robot, production cost, test / market survey I will seek additional funds to manufacture. I believe that producing can be manage on a small scale with methods using 3d printing. However, I am prepared to produce Alphas the conventional method (OEM) if unit demand goes up. I've many resource to manufacture because of my involvement in the high tech toy industry.Thank you so kindly for your interest in reading about my project description. So that you have a better scope of what I'm trying to produce I've included the description of the monthly adventure story of Alpha and the Creaturebots published in a popular robotics magazine over the past few years in both English and Korean. I felt it was a good way to introduce the character robot.Here is my summery of the production schedule once prototype is completed.

Release, Launch App Store & Server.I wanted to introduce the concept of CreatureBots and Alpha's character in a form of a whimsical story. Alpha and the CreatureBots is the story of an eccentric inventor (Mr. Cooke) well known by the local folks and neighborhood kids for his wacky toys, gadgets and robots he builds. After years of development Mr. Cooke completes a very intelligent animatronics creature he calls Alpha. The one thing missing is the very special A.I. brain. One day in Mr. Cooke’s lab an accident occurs when an insect falls into a substance connected to Mr. Cook’s computer and Alpha comes to life and Mr. Cooke’s program finally works. At first, Alpha is like a small child. He is curious, fascinated by the world and looks to Mr. Cooke to teach him. Alpha learns quickly but wants to know if he is “Real” like Mr. Cooke and other people. One day Alpha is stolen from Mr. Cooke by the evil antagonist of the story Mr. Burns who tries to copy Alphas unique computer brain to use as a military guidance weapon. Alpha escapes but is lost. With his memory damaged he struggles to find his way home. Along the way he meets some other fugitives’ robots and makes friends. Together they discover the world, people and themselves. Alpha must find his creator and understand the burning question of what it is to be “Real”… He must find “The Wizard of West Bloomfield” to get the answer.AlphaAlpha is the protagonist in the story. He is a passionate Artificial Intelligent Animatronics “Creature” with emotion (Not necessarily a typical robot because of this trait). He sees everything in the world as a wonder but wonders about his own existence in he world as it relates to Humans.Alpha’s Song:The following clip is a preview of the graphic novel ""Alpha & the CreatureBots Featuring Miss Christina Dixon singing Alpha's song Am I Real  Mr. CookeMr. Cooke (about 45 years old) is a mild mannered storyteller, inventor, toy-maker and futurist. He has a kind heart and is well known and loved by the neighborhood kids and in the town where he lives. Other than his dog (Rice) he lives alone so for someone to talk to he creates Alpha.SunnySunny is the little Korean girl (about 9 years old). Her English is not perfect. Her family is super wealthy and sends her to America under the care of guardians to study English. Her family is so rich they gave her a private jet to fly anywhere in the world like taking a bus. She is a little spoiled but completely oblivious to her wealth and loves her best friends.TinaTina (about 12 years old) is very smart. She loves to read and loves technology. She is very knowledgeable about history. Tina's brain is like an encyclopedia with total recall.FreddyFreddy (about 13 years old) is athletic and the brave one of the group. He is aggressive but not mean. He has musical talent and girls admire him.TonyTony(about 11 years old) is the cool one in the group. He has some issues with his family at home but enjoys relief hanging out with his friends. He is a prankster sometimes likes to play jokes on them. He likes Sunny and Sunny likes him but they are too embarrassed to show it.Mr. BurnsMr. Burns (About 55 years old) is the diabolical corporate executive of a high tech corporation. He is a megalomaniac with the sole aim to get wealthy by setting up phony corporations, cheating investors, repackaging stolen technology and selling it to the military.JerryJerry (about 35 years old) is a nerdy, weak minded business / technical manager who follows Mr. Burns orders like a slave but is always up to something sneaky. Jerry is put in charge of reverse engineering Alpha.ToborcimToborcim was once a warrior robot and fought in the great world wars between corporations and their military. Now Toborcim is useless because the war has been over for years. He is force to fight in the Robot battle arena for money and survival. He is strong minded and tough but deep down has heart of gold. Toborcim becomes Alphas friend.GummiesAre little power cells creatures that live inside the Bomies. They don’t talk. They just say “Gum”…”Mee”…“Gum”…”Mee” . Their job is to eat leaves and vegetables and turn it into electrical energy. The Gummies are small and cute but full of surprises.BommiesBommies are robotic power generators that store the Gummies inside their bodies and transfer the energy to power plants. The Bommies can speak several languages perfectly. When they speak English they sound very distinguish. The Bommies are academically knowledgeable on just about every subject but they lack personal experience. The Bomie is philosophical and becomes one of Alpha's best friend and adviser.About Donald DixonI am a High-Tech consumer product designer, Artificial Intelligence researcher and writer...  Ah Heck! ...

Using a simple computer and electrical components, I designed a small robot to complete tasks.Instantly, I was in love!It showed me that electronics was not just for fixing things. I could design amazing things with electronics too! I could open up my imagination. I could combine plastic, electronics and code to make awesome robots! It always saddens me that I did not have an opportunity to gain these skills until I was in college and had decided on my major. Thus, I decided to do something about it. I left my job and a few months later Tinker was born. Tinker the Robot's goal is simple: to inspire kids (and adults) to play with robotics!Tinker the Robot is a one-of-a kind toy that combines electronics, code, and cute robots into an interactive learning experience!Accessories -Method 2 – Scratch and C ProgrammingTinker can also be programmed using a computer. Using a FTDI Basic Breakout Board (a board and connector used to connect your circuit board to the computer), Tinker the toy becomes Tinker the development tool. Once connected to the computer, Arduino software (a free development software - http://www.arduino.cc/) can be downloaded and used to reprogram Tinker using C Programming.Thus, Tinker grows with your child!   Tinker’s Heart  -
It has the latest in micro processing technology containing an Arduino Mini Pro Board (http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardProMini).
FTDI Basic Breakout Board Addition - By adding $10 to your pledge you will receive the FTDI Basic Breakout board, allows you to upload your code onto tinker's heart! Art -Tinker was designed to be customized. Kids will be able to color and draw on Tinker. Giving them the opportunity to use their imaginations to make Tinker their own.Lab Notebook - Tinker’s downloadable lab notebook is filled with fun activities! Tinker’s lab notebook guides your child’s curiosity, providing exciting projects that teach them about electronics and code.Making Tinker not just about play but also learning.The set includes the following  -I have partnered with an awesome US manufacturer to produce our plastic parts.

 I am working with designers and engineers to ensure that the plastic and electronics are safe for your child.

 I have spent the past year working with industry experts, from designers, engineers and, of course, kids, getting Tinker the Robot ready for production. Now, all I need is your help to fulfill the first production order of 2,000 pieces. Tinker the Robot's goal is to, ""inspire kids to play with robotics."" First - How to Code I started by building out the features of the toy. I played with many different ways of entering programming logic, from LCD screens to plug in resistive icons, consulting with experts until I finally settled on a card reader. Second - Accessories! I always loved Mr.Potato Head and his plug and play attachments. However I felt they should do more. I designed the robot so that his limbs would not just be decorative, but also functional (as electronic components).Third - The Cute Factor Tinker needed to be cute to appeal to both girls and boys. Tinker was meant for kids to fall in love with as soon as they saw it. To achieve these goals I needed some help. I asked my toy designer to friends help create the Tinker you see now. Fourth - Getting FeedbackTinker was tested with boys and girls, ages 8 through 14. Giving me an opportunity to iterate on the design and the play.",Kay Yang,"$9,356",Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on May 31 2015,A toy that teaches kids electronics and programming!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,127," Looking forward to a re-launch and really love this idea!~  I'm so in for a relaunch if it doesn't work this time around.~  I love this idea!

315,"We have created an efficient and practical way for airlines
to sanitize the interiors of commercial planes between passenger loads. The Germfalcon
navigates the aircraft aisle, with its wings spread between the seatback tops
and overhead bins. Using UV-C light, we have proven a 99.99% germ-kill
rate in under 10 minutes with no damage or reaction from any cabin materials. The
Germfalcon is programmed to reach the most commonly touched passenger surfaces
and kill all germs that are exposed to the robot’s sanitizing lights. We believe that the flying public not only values routine sanitization of airplanes, but can also play an important part in airlines adopting the Germfalcon. Airlines constantly battle to gain a competitive advantage. Recently we have seen companies introduce 165 degree seat reclines and signature on-board fragrances, but nothing for sanitation.We think you care about this issue as much as we do. We hope this campaign will not only help crowdsource funding for our next step, but also crowdsource demand from airlines.Our recommendation is each plane should be disinfected at least once daily. Additionally, when a passenger shows symptoms of a common cold (or Measles, Ebola, diahrrea,
etc.), the Germfalcon is a simple, on-hand remedy to efficiently prepare the plane for its
next passengers.Ultraviolet C light technology, at a wavelength of 254 nm, is used for sterilization
in hospital operating rooms, food processing plants, water treatment facilities
and “clean rooms”.UV-C is invisible. It attacks bacterial and viral DNA and RNA, shutting down all germ functions. (The damaging
molecular bond is known as a “Dimer”.)UV-C is chemical-free, toxin-free and allergen-free. UV-C is
safe on the surfaces of passenger airplanes.Our validation studies of UV-C on airplane surfaces demonstrate a 99.99% germ kill rate on over 2 dozen airplane seating area sites...in under 10 minutes. The patented Germfalcon design optimizes UV-C light exposure
to efficiently sanitize the passenger cabin of an airplane while parked and
unoccupied. The automated robot spreads its UV-C laden wings across the top of
the seats and travels up and down the aisle killing bacteria and viruses thriving
in the passenger cabin. Strategically placed UV-C lamps efficiently expose the
plane’s most commonly touched surfaces. Germfalcon does not complete “aesthetic
cleanups” (i.e. pick up trash/wipe spills) so it will not displace any employee
positions.We’re introducing the Germfalcon project to this community of early adopters and innovators who believe in the power of crowdfunding. Unlike most Kickstarter projects, we can not give you your own unit, but your pledge will directly address a problem that undeniably effects you and probably everyone you know. One of the best parts of this crowdfunding opportunity is the chance to quantify in dollars how strongly a community of likely-flyers feels about airplane sanitation. In the last 18 months we have made great strides. And we assure you, your support is humbly received. We are committed to you, and to our vision. Your support will play a vital role in implementation of the Germfalcon across the air travel industry.We
will keep you updated on our progress with regular newsletters, videos, pictures and updates directly from our co-founders. Crowdfunded money will be used to build our 4th generation
prototype. Your support will help
us pay for the advanced programming and robotics to make Germfalcon P4 autonomous. The Germfalcon P4 unit will be used for Beta testing. Our Launch Airline will sanitize commercial airplanes before passengers board, provide feedback on the functionality, ease of use, and MTBF, etc. With your support, we hope to equip an airline's entire fleet with Germfalcon units by 2015-16 Flu season. Please consider backing us at or above the $500 level and
celebrate with us when the Germfalcon takes off!We’re based in the Los Angeles-Orange County area with
access to California’s Silicon Valley and ""Silicon Beach"". We have numerous resources in
our backyard with expertise in UV-C technology, aeronautics, robotics and
bio-medical engineering. So far, we have focused on building and
testing body and wing designs. We are now in the design phase of
our 4th prototype. To date, our
collaborative partners have contributed their knowledge and wares and we have
self-funded the operation. Now, in order to bring Germfalcon from the remote-controlled
system to an autonomous system, we need your help.The advantages to creating a fully autonomous Germfalcon are
worth the effort and investment. The autonomous version will be the ideal design for the Germfalcon and meets the airlines' safety, insurance, and sanitation needs.Germfalcon P4 will be the final design for the run of beta units, and the blueprint for our first manufacturing run. The plan is to begin building P4 immediately and begin Beta testing in Summer 2015, starting a slow rollout before Flu Season (typically begins in December.) We will learn a lot from P4, and we will tweak the design as necessary to meet the needs of our customers (airlines) and their customers (YOU).Dr. Kreitenberg holds seven U.S. Patents, and Germfalcon is his second using Ultraviolet light.

317,"''I invite you all to follow and see this project unfold. Step by step details of everything, files containing the 3D models for printing, the software, assembly instruction, videos of test runs and pictures. you'll even learn about several innovative ideas as we go along. pledge or no pledge, I invite you on a journey like you've never seen before.'' - RémyImportant update: It seems like a lot of people have unrealistic expectations from this project so I'd like to be more precise on a few very important details. First it's quite obvious that with a 32k budget, you're not gonna get a robot that's like the ones you see in movies. Second, while my claims of what it can do seem unreal, they're not if you think of them as very basic accomplishments for a robot and don't expect them to be done as well as a human would. Third, while I'll do what i can for it to seem human, there's noway this will actually fool anyone into thinking it's human. On a final note, I hope you can all get passed the ideas created by movies and see this project for what it really is; a prototype bringing together current existing technology so that it can be improved on.The Robot:
The dream is to one day have robots that look and feel organic, however, for this project, Marie will have similar strength to an average human, skin, hair and human features and expressions. Pressure, temperature, stretch sensors and more will garnish the robot from head to toes. She will have stereoscopic vision, a voice, microphones, so it can see, hear and talk. Powered by lithium batteries, she will be able to travel outside. Instrumentation will be plentiful and precise, giving Marie the ability to assess her surroundings.The Goal:
My vision is to push robotics towards the general public by producing a first generation prototype so that software can be developed for it.The Software: Since there's no need to reinvent the wheel, we'll be incorporating several existing open source projects that exist, like facial recognition. Other modules will be licensed, like voice recognition, while the remainder will be developed in house.What's Done So Far:
The research on all aspects of the robot. Planning a timeline, estimating costs, looking up available technology, calculating power requirements and making sure everything is doable, deciding on design principals and methods of construction as well as planning production and calculating forces applied to materials. Developing new ways of doing things was a large part of this project. Just about all the 3d models are ready, with some bit of work and adjustments left.What this will accomplish: This project will close the gap between really expensive prototypes and production models that the public can afford.Applications:
What can Marie do? Well, not much without software, but as software moves forward, here are some of the things it will be able to do, in order of how they will be developed: There's so much more that will be added but that's where the plan is at.The Details:
The skeleton will be 3d printed, made out of nylon. A system of small motors, of the type used in rc cars, and of kevlar strings will be made for articulations. The whole design will closely mimic human movements. For this initial prototype, lithium batteries will power Marie for an approximate 2 hours of labor.New Ways of doing things:
So, what makes this robot special? The way it will walk; instead of a rigid footing it will have a soft footing allowing it to walk like a human by letting it feel pressure on different areas of the feet. Low energy consumption and being lightweight will make this robot stand apart from existing projects. the estimated weight is 80 pounds. a nearly all plastic design helps make this happen. A light weight means smaller motors, less energy used and lower cost.Marie's Requirements: A clutter free home is essential. Marie wont step on junk on the floor. A dedicated place where Marie can plug herself in to charge. Don't leave Marie unsupervised with children, her strength isn't enough to seriously hurt an adult but her weight is sufficient enough to hurt a small child.Why a female? Mainly for cost. The average female is quite a bit smaller then the average male. Easily 25lbs of difference. That would represent 25% more material, power and energy. I'll be shipping Marie in the fetal position in a box, and with packing it should be 120lbs and should fit in a 24'' x 24'' x 36'' box. i got various quotes and for the USA they start at 500$. customs and duty apply.About me: 27 years old and a creative mind that thinks outside the box to bring new concepts to the table and inside the box to use what already exists and works.

Having a background in electricity, I was at the top of my class when it came to setting up hardware controlled by computers. 2 years in an aerospace company gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about machines. Robotics club was my muse.

Research is the word of the day when it comes to my occupation during non productive hours. I've spent over 5 years researching and planning everything that needs to be done for this project to take life, as well as educating myself in many connected fields like plastics, 3d printing, programming and physics.

Commitment and dedication are the words that best describe this project on a personal level.

This project will be the best because we are fully passionate about making a difference. ThynkBot by ThynkWare Innovation, Inc. is based upon the founder’s patent-pending technology for a “mind-controlled virtual assistant on a smartphone device” as it is applied to robots. Check out the patent here.ThynkBot is easy to use! ThynkBot is fun and people of any age can use this brainwave technology gadget. We have proven it by letting a 5-year-old demonstrate it in our video. The ThynkBot Bundle includes a fantastic self-balancing robot, an incredible EEG headset, and the ThynkWare Innovation ThynkBot app for iPad, iOS or Android phones.ThynkBot uses a cool mini-robot that connects by Bluetooth with the ThynkBot application and the user’s mobile wirelessly. Once you get started, you think “forward” and the robot moves forward. Think “back” and the robot moves back. Further extend your mental “telekinetic” prowess by thinking “turn left” and “turn right” and the robot will get turning in the new direction.If you are not giving the robot enough of your mental attention, ThynkBot will let out a voice of dismay. If you are totally in the zone, ThynkBot will also let you know by voicing a burst of excitement.     Make your video accessible in other languages and to deaf and hard-of-hearing backers.The key to the ThynkBot is the patent-pending technology which takes the input from the Neurosky MindWave Mobile EEG headset and translates the raw signals into words that are used for commands to the robot. The result of all this is sheer fun in controlling an actual robot with your mind! ThynkWare Innovation technology does not stop with ThynkBot and controlling robots by thought. We are working on projects on a variety of platforms and framework including iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, RFduino, Windows, and Node.JS. We have a number of products in the works for the future that use thoughts for control:ThynkWare Speech (for ALS and physically challenged patients)ThynkWare TV (for television/media consumers)ThynkWare Home (for smart home users)ThynkWare Office (for office and work professionals)ThynkWare Assistant (for smartphone virtual assistant users)ThynkWare Games (gamers, of course!)ThynkWare Car (for controlling vehicles systems, not driving)ThynkWare Outbound Telepathy (for the rest of the world who want to communicate with others).

ThynkWare chose 2K as the goal because we reached this mark on previous launches. This seemed better than having an unsuccessful campaign with the 100K goal and relaunching it over and over.ThynkWare Innovation has many other products that are also in the works that need greater attention. We have a ThynkWare Home, ThynkWare TV, and ThynkWare Car to name only a few that are waiting in line behind ThynkBot.Even if we only deliver ThynkBot to a handful of backers, this will be fine historically speaking. These will be the lucky owners of the first ThynkWare Innovation product and once ThynkWare Innovation completes it first funding round, satisfying the deep-pocketed VCs that are currently waiting to infuse money into the corporation to scale it globally, then these few public ThynkBots may become enormously valuable. Years from now, people who own them will have an exclusive piece of brainwave technology history from ThynkWare Innovation.ThynkWare Innovation's main goal is to bring the ThynkWare technology to everyone so that we can use it daily. There is a long road ahead for the company, but ThynkBot is part of its beginning. Once we deliver the ThynkBot, ThynkWare will then focus in obtaining the necessary working capital it needs to hire the engineers around the globe that share our vision for creating a mind-enabled future for everyone. At ThynkWare Innovation, we are all visionaries, creators and innovators for a better future.Thank you again for the question!ThynkWare Innovation, Inc.

319,"Ever feel like you need an extra arm?  I did, so we built it.  Welcome to the RaaX Robotics Biomimetic Arm Kickstarter project. RaaX Robotics is developing a new generation of low cost, practical robotic tools to serve Tinkerers and Makers, Science, Light Industrial and Agricultural markets. First, what is a biomimetic arm? Biomimetics is the study and development of systems that mimic the formation, function, or structure of biologically produced substances, materials,  mechanisms, or processes. When RaaX Robotics started developing this product we wanted to mimic the human arm. The human arm with its limited mechanical motion can lift and manipulate and impressive amount of weight to accomplish practical physical work on a daily basis. The
problem however, was how do you mimic such a complex system as the human arm and
keep cost low. To accomplish this we re-thought certain aspects of arm mechanics
and incorporated increased leverage mechanics. We believed this would
allow us to generate substantial
lift capacity while still keeping cost of the arm affordable.With this idea we set out to develop a low cost mechanical device that could perform functionally similar to or mimic the human arm. Four features of the human arm stood out  1) Ridged support structure (bone). 2) Ball and socket type of joints (wrist, elbow, shoulder). 3) Linear actuation mechanism (muscles). 4) Torsional flex (tendons and muscles). The RaaX Robotic Arm in this project is the result of our effort to translate and integrate these four human arm features into a mechanical device. In the design process it became clear early on, that the ball and socket joint was the key to success and after many iterations we were able to come up with the current design shown in image below. By using a center pivot point ball and ball pivot points on each actuator mount we were able to get the maximum range of motion and leverage.This design allows over 90 degrees in angle motion and uniquely a full 360 degree rotation without twisting the arm.  The motion geometry of each arm joint provides a 3 dimensional sperical cone as shown below.The Physics behind the RaaX Robotic Arm joint design are simple Class 1 Lever mechanics that help amplify the actuators push pull force.The mechanical advantage of a lever can be determined by considering the balance of moments or torque, T, about the fulcrum, T1 = M1a =M2b =T2where M1 is the input force to the lever and M2 is the output force. The distances a and b are the perpendicular distances between the forces and the fulcrum.The mechanical advantage of the lever is the ratio of output force to input force,MA = M2b/M1a = a/bThis relationship means that the mechanical advantage can be computed from the ratio of the distances from the fulcrum, or pivot point, to where the input and output forces of the actuators are applied to the lever ( the bar connecting the actuator to the pivot
point). By changining the length of the aluminum joint bars, you can change the force or lift capacity of the robotic arm without changing actuatorsAs we were developing the arm we had several issues with the performance off the shelf linear actuators. In order to solve these problems we ended up designing or own actuators and we are offering the new patent pending RaaX Modular Linear Actuators as rewards in this projectTo obtain the actuation control we needed for the arm we designed the RaaX Actuators to have the following features, compact housing, true postion feedback, built in variable speed motor controler, ability to change motor gearing and the ability to change the actuator length. Our new actuator design features aircraft quality aluminum construction, modular components, sealed main bearing, linear potentiometer, analog and PWM motor driver, 6 Volt gear motor, silcone gasket in choice of 8 colors and anodized finish. In addition to all of this RaaX Actuators are completely rebuildable so no more having to buy a completely new actuator if something breaks or if you burn out a motor etc.Once we had the final joint design, and the actuators designed the next step was the rigid support structure. This needed to be as low weight as possible yet rigid enough for the forces needed to lift weight at 36 inches of arm extension. A truss like design was used incorporating super light weight aluminum tubing.  Each truss section weighs in at 7.5 ounces and each actuator weighs just 7.7 ounces keeping the total arm weight to a minimum.  The remaining mechanical parts for the rigid support system of the arm and the actuator mounts were designed and machined as show above.The patent pending RaaX Arm is designed so that each section is modular and can be snapped together with minimal effort. Once snapped together just tighten the screws, connect the wires and its ready to go. The torsion suspension keeps everything aligned and allows the arm to flex if it accidently hits something. The torsion bands are available in different colors and stiffnesses so you can change the flexibility of the arm if needed.Next we designed and developed the control system, in the image below we developed a breadboard to handle all six of the actuators motor driver control needs. The breadboard is in turn connected to an Arduino Mega 2560 board that could handle the number of I/O pins we needed. Open source software modules were developed and will be available for download with the purchase of a RaaX ArmWith a succesful Kickstarterfunding campain, the finished actuators will each have their own internal motor driver control board. This will eliminate the need for the  prototype breadboard in the picture. Each actuator will be able connect directly to the Arduino or Pi board. As a stretch goal we will offer a RaaX Arduino shield to plug the actuators into and simplify the wiring even more. We are using this Kickstarter campaign to help fund the production start up and tooling cost needed to manufacture the RaaX Robotics products in a cost effective manner. ",RaaX Robotics,$341,Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on Dec 19 2014,"RaaX Robotics introduces a new modular, plug and play robotic arm.

Please refer to Update #5 After 4 years of research and testing, we have now developed a fully functional manufacturing prototype of rClock and are ready for production. With the funds raised on Kickstarter we will be able to start the final manufacturing setup and have the required injection molds machined. rClock has three different alarm modes. By using the touch with sound mode, you will have a better chance in waking up than any other alarm clocks including your smart phones. The robot arm tapping provides the element needed to wake any heavy sleepers. The buzzer is there to provide the extra support.

 Note: Alarm position was not the most ideal in the video. We recommend placing rClock 90 degrees next to the user but if space is not available then by using the snooze button; test the arm to confirm it comes into contact with the bed or sofa. Like in the video many positions work well with rClock. Users would be able to find their ideal positions very soon after using the rClock.Please refer to: Update #3 or Benny's Blog on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/benii20seedrClock’s prototype 1 was created 4 years ago in 2010. For the first 3 years it was used for testing the effectiveness of the new arm system. rClock was originally created by the Benny for himself, therefore many testing and adjustments have been done daily since. After the idea of sharing rClock was decided, prototype 2 was made using inventor 3D modelling and SLA 3D printing.  Unfortunately due the lack of experience, the model was good for display but not ready for manufacturing. It wasn’t until the fortunate establishment of partnership with Tytronics that gave Bitzong’s team the resource to complete the third prototype of rClock.  This third prototype is the current manufacturing prototype shown in the video.  Unfortunately the housing is also made using 3D printing at an expensive price of $300AUD. This is why injection molds are needed in order to make rClock affordable.

cups on the bottom of rClock acts as its legs allowing it to maintain stability while the arm is
active. The suction cups work well on any flat surface, such as a bedside table,
and through testing have been found to be very effective. Alarm Modes                                                                                                               There are
three different alarm modes to suit the user’s preference; these are a physical/touch alarm, an audio alarm, and a combination of touch and audio alarm. Settings                                                                                                                     There are
three buttons located on the back of rClock which allows the user to change various
settings of the device; these settings include the time, date and the alarm
mode as well as the speed at which the arm will swing. A fourth button on the
back of rClock allows the alarm mode to be changed or the alarm to be turned
off quickly and easily without going through multiple settings.The rClock features a large back-lit LCD screen which displays the time and date as well as which of the three alarm modes the rClock is in.The snooze button on the top of rClock has multiple uses; as well as being used as a standard snooze button found on most alarm clocks, it can also be used to test the position and speed of the rClock’s arm swing. This feature easily allows the rClock to be positioned in the optimal position for awakening the user. A small light on the front of rClock indicates whether or not the snooze function is on. The
rClock features an optional arm extension to increase the distance that it can
be placed from the user. The extension is made from the same lightweight and
strong material as the arm. It is specially designed so that the arm doesn't
bend excessively. The main purpose of the extension is to ensure the rClock
awakens the user, even if they roll-over during their sleep. Through years of
testing, however, it was found that in most circumstances the user doesn't need
an extension except if they sleep by themselves in a bed larger than a double
bed.For every $5,000 which our campaign receives we will donate two rClocks to someone who suffer from hearing loss. Once we reach our funding goal, we will donate five rClocks per $5,000 raised. At Bitzong our team is determined to deliver high quality products. During the development phase we spent a great amount of time making sure rClock met our high standards. In fact our team is so confident, we are backing all rClocks with a free 6 month warranty starting from when our customers first receive their own rClock.

322,"Would you like to own a smart robot like R2-D2, C-3PO or Chappie? Perhaps you think it belongs to a realm of Hollywood or science fiction? Or that you need to wait another 100 years for technical progress to converge on affordability? But Lego parts, motors, sensors can be had rather cheaply these days. So what are you waiting for? Ah yes, you need AI. You need that mysterious robotic brain to bring your creation alive. In which case your wait is over.We made it. It’s our pleasure to introduce a family of ELFi robots - DIY robots built from Lego, Tetrix, Arduino or Raspberry Pi parts powered by our Brain App.  This is a robotic Brain which can be installed as a usual mobile app. It uses hi-tech features of modern mobile operating systems combined with powerful Artificial Intelligence Clouds.What can those ELFi robots do? They can do almost anything!They can communicate with you using natural English (other languages will be supported soon). They can perform tasks and notify you about various events.We offer a Robotic Platform for learning and building intelligent robots. This platform comprises of: Ready-to-use robots We will give you access to our RoboMarket so you may commence your robotic journey supported by existing instruction manuals. Meet our first band of robots: Use casesUse case 1. ""Build and use""If you don’t have intention to become a robot inventor you can take our ready-made building manuals. We’ll also help you to order all needed Lego, Tetrix, Arduino or Paspberry Pi parts. After completion of building process you'll have to install a Brain App and choose predefined set of features for your robot. Those will be downloadable as apps from RoboMarket. This is it. You are ready to talk to your very own robots and have tons of fun!At any time you can extend body of your robot or install new capabilities. We’ve already made available many apps on RoboMarket and the number is constantly growing! Here is a concise list of selected functionality: Karate (for Big ELFi); Bring the ball (for Lucky); Disco Dance (for Big ELFi), Beverage machine (for middle-sized Lego + Arduino based robot model), IR Wall (for indoor navigation), Math Teacher (for Small ELFi), Guide (for all robot models), Quizz for kids (any robot), Telepresence (for all robots), Memorialist (for all robots), Guardian (for all robots), Robotized Games, and many more.
 Use case 2. ""Learn Robotics""Our primary audience is avid robot builders and inventors. We strongly believe in bright future where robots will help people in their daily life on this and other planets. Your own ELFi will evolve along with your skills. We will guide you through easy yet feature rich tutorial starting with simple mechanics and finishing with image and voice recognition, as well as writing functional code for robotic applications.When ELFi works in educational mode he plays two roles simultaneously:Our ELFi Edu Program covers both hardware and software aspect required to understand basics of robotics. Both aspects start from very simple patterns and don’t assume any previous experience in robotics.Mentioned materials you can find in ELFi Robotics Workbook. This book focuses on kids and absolute beginners in robotics. It covers indoor navigation, dance routines, simple algorithms that can be programmed in spoken communications with ELFi. This book establishes solid foundation yet allows you to get practical understanding of complex things. For example kids will be able to understand the meaning of context, entity and intent in Natural Language Understanding, play with face recognition. Also this book introduces basics for coding of controllers (Lego and Arduino). So the kids will be able to create unique movements of robot and integrate it with spoken user interface. The final task for the course is creation of new robot with new layout of motors.

 We are working on the second book focused on more experienced students and software developers. This is Robotics for programmers. This book allows smooth transition to robotics for ""classic"" programmers. Knowledge of object oriented programming language is expected.  The book describes in details software architecture of ELFi's Brain, its API and extensions.Use case 3. ""Develop and publish""We’re providing set of programming and debugging tools for adopting of our robotic brain to your own robots or new robotic features and apps. Software developers, embedded systems programmers, robot makers can use ELFi Robotics toolset for their inventions and startups. Here are some of those tools: As a software developer you can register your developer account inside our RoboMarket. This is application delivery platform similar to Google Play or App Store. Here you can develop, publish and sell your apps for any existing robot.If you are a Robot-maker or seasoned FLL/FRC player - you are welcomed to upload and sell your terrific robot manuals on RoboMarket in category of building instructions. Structure of Robotic BrainBrainApp is distributed software which includes native mobile code, server code and cloud integration. It includes: Vision, Face detection, Face recognition, Speech Recognition, Natural Language Understanding, Text-To-Speech service, Indoor Navigation, Open Algorithms (for creation new behavior even without coding), XMPP for Human to Robot communications, XMPP for Robot to Robot communications.Hardware Compatibility Let’s consider compatible hardware parts in human body analogy:Head : Android phones or tablets (now), IPhone, IPod, Ipad (in close future) Backbone : Lego EV3, Arduino, Raspberry Pi controllers, shields and blocks Skeleton : Lego Technic, Tetrix, Custom parts (for heavy robots) Skin : Lego decoration parts, 3D-printed parts, Custom elementsMuscles : Lego EV3 motors, Lego Power Function motors, Tetrix motors, Arduino Steppers, Servos, Solenoids, Motor controllersSenses: Android, IOS, Lego, Arduino SensorsCurrently we have a working Minimal Viable Product of ELFi Robotics Platform. It includes full-functioning Brain app for Android, RoboMarket for Android, API Java classes, various tools for remote control, scripting, programming with voice, telepresence.  There are 5 different robots built and tested on the platform. At the end of August 2015 ELFi Robotics published Alpha Version of ELFi Robotics Platform for limited number of registered users - mainly Lego Robot makers and FLL team members.Now we need Kickstarter funds to extend our Brain App and RoboMarket to iOS devices and to build awesomely huge robots made from Tetrix and custom metal parts. 
We're going to send iOS version of ELFi Brain for free to all our backers who pledged £100 or more when it will be ready.The story begun two years ago when 13-years old Mark Drobnych working on his personal scientific research: School Presentation Microscope. The results of this work were presented at Final of Google Science Fair 2014 in Mountain View, California. During that project Mark started to integrate Android and Lego Mindstorms blocks. As functions of microscope begun to be more complex Mark have got an idea to create an universal Robotic Brain on top of Android operating system. This Brain had to create human-friendly spoken interface not only for his Presentation Microscope but for ANY ROBOTIC BODY built from Lego, Arduino, Tetrix or Raspbery Pi parts. There was ELFi birthday. To enforce his progress on software part Mark involved his dad, Oleksiy into project as an experienced software engineer.

323,"I started my early studies with computer science at high school and had computers and 3D as a part of every day life like any other IT interested teenager.I left the IT field to pursue an collage education and professional career in construction-engineering with an assigned role of project manager for a 300 M£ hospital construction project at the age of 26. Upon learning about deep machine learning (a part of artificial intelligence) I immediately realized both the practical and economic benefits the application of deep machine learning trough computer vision and cognitive computing would bring to my field of work.My business idea is developing a wetware (AI ""software"") that uses deep machine learning to ""learn"" the process of planing constructions just by ""watching"" engineers/architects working in 3D CAD-software.This 3D-CAD wetware will further be helped by cognitive software that helps guide it trough the complex decisions and processes of construction design by incorporating information fetched directly from scientific texts about thermodynamics, physics, price, geometric data and so on connected to certain facts found directly in the 3D CAD-components that make up an 3D CAD-model (for example what material a 3D-component is supposed to be made of in reality). Step 2 in developing this intelligent construction robot will be using these 3D CAD-models to guide an industrial robot attached to a heavy terrain transport vehicle (a container stacker for example).The industrial robot attached to the transport vehicle will be picking up the building parts from a fixed material depot on site and ""stack""/""apply"" the parts in to a complete building in an pre-defined order determined by the wetware.The transport vehicle and the robot will be guided by cameras using photo-recognition to identify the individual building-parts when they are being picked up from the material depot on site. Upon picking up the correct part the vehicle and robot will be guided by following the coordinates that the wetware compiled 3D CAD-model makes up. The zero-point in this x-y-z-coordinate system would be set at the coordinates and height of one of the building corners.   Buildings are what makes our entire society and around 10% of all construction costs consist of the costs for engineers and architects and around 40% of all costs consist of labor costs so there are billions of dollars in developing a wetware that just makes all the rational decisions in designing a building and further an all-terrain construction robot.I agree with the folks at Google DeepMind I've spoken to on their estimate on this being about 5-10 years in to the future but not working out the architecture for this solution would be a shame when that day comes. Some of the ""free"" benefits to this sort of construction planing are the VR-models that can be generated directly in the 3D-CAD models (seen here rendered by me in one manually compiled 3D CAD-model http://pano.autodesk.com/pano.html?url=jpgs/daf3bb83-c571-475e-9756-6be0134120f9 (open it in your phone for best effect ,and use a pair of VR-goggles) This solution would revolutionize the entire developed part of our planet since buildings pretty much make up the physical environment of our society, It would make the work of engineers more effective if applied to interfaces like augmented reality (hololens).",Nikola Andrasic,SEK 0,Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on Jul 15 2016,"An intelligent, heavy terrain construction robot.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,0, ,0,"SEK 39,250,000",OMNI - Intelligent Construction Robots (Canceled) by Nikola Andrasic — Kickstarter
324,"I have always wanted to build my own robots. Not the small kind we see today that can fit in the palm, but Star Wars bots I watched as a kid in the 1980’s. My first proper robot was a R2D2-like droid with beeping dialect. And of course I gave him an arm so that he can serve me drinks after a long day at the office. My second robot was built to look more like an iRobot. In making both these robots, I had the need to manage my image processing and overlay robot data directly onto my robot’s webcam image. There are graphical tools on the internet for creating high tec. HUD animations, but these are applied to pre-recorded movies. Image processing for robotics is all about working with live image streams and keeping the frame rate high – animations and shading can affect performance if not properly managed. I also needed flexibility in terms of HUD layout and content so both my robots could use it. And so I developed a general purpose HUD application.When you watch the video notice how the RHUD components change to reflect what's actually going on - they are not just for show.QUESTION: I’m not a programmer and I don’t have a robot, can I use RHUD?If you have a PC running Windows 7 SP1 and a webcam then you can use RHUD. RHUD itself does not actually capture images or do any image processing, so I will include sample applications (see Roadmap) that demonstrates how RHUD, webcam device and colour blob detection all work together. Take a look at the video below to see how objects are defined and stored in the database.You can also customize RHUD without the need for programming skills. There is a configuration file that changes the graphical style. I've created a few different styles which you've seen, here's another: QUESTION: I am a programmer, can I create a HUD like those found in Iron Man and Star Trek.If you are familiar with the C# programming language then you can extend and customize my base classes in the usual object-oriented way. If you are not familiar with C#, you may know that this is one of the easier to learn programming languages. You will need to install Microsoft Visual Studio Express .Net 4.0 C# (freely available on the internet).My end goal is to offer a complete robot solution, including hardware and software as demonstrated in the video. This can be a robot head with stereo vision, like my C1 robot, or simply a pan-tilt mounted camera. As this is my first Kickstarter project, I decided to break this task into two manageable stages.  STAGE 1: Software only (this Kickstarter project).The software can be used with your own robot or simply as a cool webcam viewer that has image processing capability. No programming is needed for the latter, and I've added an extra reward for people who don't want programming capability. For programmers, I've created several source code projects. They are designed from a tutorial perspective, with each project building on the previous: Layout Sample - This sample shows how to layout RHUD components.  Webcam Sample - This sample shows how to display webcam images in the RHUD. I’m using an EMGU webcam driver which supports commercial PC webcams including IP addresses.  Servo Sample - This sample shows how to control servo motors using a PC mouse. By clicking the mouse pointer on the screen, a pan-tilt mechanism can be controlled. I have interfaces for Phidgets and Pololu servo controllers.  Color Image Processing Sample - This shows how to detect colored blobs in a webcam image. It also shows how to automatically control a pan-tilt mechanism, permitting automatic object finding and motion tracking. STAGE 2: Hardware and additional software (beyond this Kickstarter)The content below is provided only as an indication of the kind of topics I will address as part of a more complete robot solution involving software plus hardware.  Image Processing (extended) - I have code for face detection, object recognition using contours (not just color), and motion detection. All of these need to be integrated with RHUD.  Speak Sample - This sample shows how to turn text into speech which is output to PC speakers.  Listen Sample - This sample shows how to listen for voice input from a microphone, and how to not listen when the PC is speaking.  Behaviour Sample - This sample is what brings all the other samples together and enables human-robot interaction and more complex robot automation. If there is anything I haven't made clear, or if you want to know if I intend on providing other features, please don't hesitate to contact me.

By logging-in to Memori through a browser a user (receiver user) can interact, like in a chat, with the owner of the device, who previously recorded their thoughts. The owner of this device can store their words, secrets, questions and answers, while waiting for future users, to log on and interact with Memori as if they were talking directly to them.Memori srl is a startup based in Bologna (Italy) and established by Nunzio Fiore. Nunzio was co-founder of the tech company coders51, a firm with headquarters in Bologna and specialized in complex Web platforms, mobile and IoT. Now he has embarked on a new and revolutionary venture:  he is launching Memori, a digital “memory box” that transforms our thoughts into an interactive experience. Memori is an object with a plain and simple design, which users visualize in the suggestive shape of a stylized treasure chest. Texts, images and audio files can be  stored in Memori, but what makes it truly unique are two important functions that transform memories into an interactive experience. The fundamental technology of Memori was developed through extensive research in IoT and adaptive bots conducted by Nunzio and supported by the coders51 team and other professionals: these systems can interpret the user's questions and give accurate and relevant answers. With Memori this technology is shifted to an emotional level: talking to Memori means interacting with someone who would like to share their thoughts and feelings instead of their services.

The most important priority of our roadmap software is to never abandon those who own a Memori. We will make it possible for anyone to update it by a simple push button, or even automatically. By this doing, we  assure our clients that they will enjoy increasingly  advanced functions.
BACKUP SERVICEThe second priority of our roadmap software is the backup service. We will assure backup and restore procedures that can allow the updating of Memori and its maintenance.
MNEMONICS AND EMOTIONAL DISEASES RESEARCHAt the end of the Kickstarter campaign and the start of a massive production, we are planning a study with medical experts specialized in the cure of Mnemonics and Emotional Diseases, to develop a version of Memori that can be useful to people who have problems with their memory. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCHLater we will start a study to introduce some principles of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which are useful to enhance the Memori search engine  and to make it respond with a precision that allows it to learn and to refine itself over time, in order to become more and more similar to us. Memori will be sold in three versions. The first has a capacity of 16GB. We have developed the software so that it can store, besides an almost incalculable number of textual memories, up to 3000 images and up to 500 hours of audio recordings. The second has a capacity of 32GB. Ideal for those who wish to enrich their memories with the most exciting pictures and audio recordings. It can save up to 8000 images and up to 1200 hours of audio recordings.
The 64gb version is the version for your life. You can save your textual memories without limitation and up to 16,000 images and 2500 hours of speech.
This means that you could speak for 8 hours a day for a year and record it. 
The memories and stories that Memori helps to preserve are precious and extraordinary: the more space you have, the more memories and emotions you can store in your Memori box. The more memories it contains, the more similar it will be to you. We have developed some rewards which will give access to the Exclusive Community Member to a limited number of backers. Memori is just the first of a series of products that we have in our pipeline and that will be useful to manage and store your memories over time. We will have products and applications which are useful to backup, upgrade, make remote registrations and a lot more. Community members will be entitled to 20% discount on every product or service forever. They will also receive an invitation to use the products in advance and will have direct contact with us for feedback and maintenance.We have studied a series of rewards that will be able to help everyone to take part in giving life to this project.In particular, we would like to highlight:The minimum target we want to achieve is 100,000 Euro, but we have set some goals that we will gradually release as the figure  increases, thanks to the support of our bakers.  A goal that we consider particularly important is the 300,000 Euro one, which should suffice to start a study to support the research project of a Memori dedicated to memory disorders.The long road to be the first science fiction company:The applications of Memori are based on positive memories, experiences and distance, both in time and in space: for instance, it is possible to record one's states of mind when a child is born or starts walking, and retrieve them or share them when he or she comes of age. Memories can be associated with the child’s first shoes, which will be recognized by Memori, or to any object that might trigger the recollection of a special moment. With Memori one can also take some snapshots of one's emotional growth and rediscover them years later, in order to see them and see oneself again in the contents. It is possible to entrust Memori with our answers to “big” questions as well - like life, challenges, goals, lessons, or advice - and let people discover them: what would I like to say to my daughter on the day of her birth, when she can't understand me yet? Loved ones who are far away or life-long friends can receive a precious interactive Memori treasure chest, so they can recall the traces we have chosen to leave them in a sort of time capsule. One of the main characteristics of this object is its independence from devices, operative systems, services or platforms, which might not exist or be based on different standards in a few years: with Memori you know for certain that it will always be possible to access the experiences stored therein.Nunzio said: ""We could have developed a mobile app, but smartphones did not exist ten years ago and in ten years they will have become obsolete. Memori is a real object that will exist and accompany you forever. We will update the device remotely ; however, if this should become impossible in the future, Memori will still be yours and you will be able to consult it in 50 years just as you are able to do so today.""We have considered different usage scenarios. You can use it to leave some memories to someone, to make a journey and leave some objects that describe your trip, maybe  to let someone else recall and retrace the same itinerary in the future. You can leave secrets linked to objects around the world and encourage somebody to live an adventure . We have always felt a need for adventure: thanks to Memori, you can live it at last and let a loved one live it as well. There are people who would like to use Memori to chat with their past self in the future. We are only at the beginning of our adventure and we are eager to know how all of you will use it.Memori is the brainchild of Nunzio Fiore, 40 years old, a web developer and innovator from Milan, whose inspiration has always been drawn from both technology and emotions: as a programmer and writer, he combines his passion for hi-tech with didactics by teaching children about robotics. As far as functions and design are concerned, the concept was developed by Eugenia Vallini, an art director and designer with a passion for technology and cyberpunk, who created the identity of Memori. Memori is already a reality in prototype form; the first units were produced in 3D printing and built using development components with the help of the firm TryeCo 2.0. The industrial production of Memori and the commercial launch worldwide is the reason of this Kickstarter campaign. The first units will be delivered by the end of 2017.All the people in the Memori team can help to achieve the success of this great project. Those people are:Nunzio FioreLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nunziofiore/Web Developer since 1998. Experience in web (java, ruby on rails) and IoT.

Added detailed DIY video below.Smart Mini-arm is a robot arm that contains six motors, two chips, two sheets of plastic template, and other components such as screws, gears, and DuPont wires. 
 Why ""Smart Club""?STEM and STEAM education approach is globally well-known. For our robot lab, we replaced ""E"" with ""r"", standing for ""robot"". We limit the range of engineering to robotics to represent our educational approach. Therefore, Smart club to us is Science, Math, Art and Artificial intelligence, robots, and technology.  Mini-arm has very high educational values. Our instruction starts from how to strip wires, wrap around the motors, all the way to writing a control program on MIT App Inventor, which is an online app writer. We assume that you know nothing about technology, so we try to include as detailed instructions as possible. However, if you do have previous knowledges, you can always skip ahead. 
 When we made some samples of the robot kit, we hosted a small class and received very positive responses from the children and their parents. There's no recommendation of age for Mini-arm, because we encourage all age groups to learn robotics.  As showed in the gallery, we provide all the components of Smart Club Mini-arm. For most kids, building up a robot arm by themselves, with their friends, or with their parents are very exciting. It teaches them about how robots work in a very basic concept with first hand experience. Comparing to many robots on the market, our Mini-arm has not only 6 motors, but also two chips with two on-and-off switch. The Bluetooth chip connects to the Motor control chip, allowing you to control all 6 motors at once. 

 As mentioned before, our instruction teaches you how to write a program on the MIT App Inventor. We also provide a written software online for you to download. In that software, you can control the robot arm spontaneously or by writing a script. The script uses the concept of block programming, that you will set one or more motion for the robot at various time parameters. It is an extremely fun way to learn coding for beginners. You can design scripts for your robot to complete different tasks or compete in robot games. If the campaign is successful, we will donate 15 Smart Club Mini-arms to a random Title I high school or middle school in the U.S.!A huge focus of our lab is Industry 4.0. The physical cyber system intrigue us, and our mini-arm is a representation of the Internet of Things, as those arms connects to smartphones, which have WiFi connections. When there are multiple arms and have written scripts, the arms can act as an industry to complete tasks. 
If you have done some research, then you can see that the price of our mini-arm is much lower than others, especially when our six-motor Smart Club Mini-arm is a simplified version of factory robot arms. Our goal is to create something the majority of people can afford easily. It is important to learn about technology in a first hand experience, and we want to lower the financial barriers so people can cross over. With your support on Kickstarter, we can make more people acknowledge technology's steps to future. We all want to live a better life, and technology can make that happen. However, we must understand it before utilizing it. Our mini-arm can be the first step, for you and me. We have more types of robots finished, but we choose to present Mini-arm to you because we believe that this robot represent our idea the most. It is interesting, filled with content, highly educational, and can be utilized in various ways. It gives all of us a glance at our future life, and our ultimate goal is to let everyone see what we are seeing.   If the campaign is successful, we will be able to launch more robots, open online courses for charity (similar to our last reward listed), and create our own pathway to our future. Thank you for reading, and please support us to reach our dream. DIY Detailed Video:  ",RoboInside,"$2,276",Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on Nov 17 2017,"An educational and recreational DIY technological toy with 6 motors, Bluetooth, and block programming.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,32," Cancelled, that's a bummer. The vids I asked for, it was really too late to edit -and- get out to markets.I wish you wouldn't give up on this project!! It's an awesome educational tool!The mistakes were in marketing, more specifically potential-customer-interface.The other detail it REALLY needed was a recharge port, potentially wireless/inductive so the device could be parked next to a chargerIf you want to try again I'm still willing to do a proper demo video.~  Sadly, project is canceled? I am very interestet, beause this is the one and only arm that can drive. There are a lot of robot arm on KS, thingiverse, github and so on, but this is the only one that can drive like a remote car too. :-)~  Please keep us informed if you start up this project again, here or elsewhere.  I am greatly interested in your device, and would definitely be a future backer.~  What Blayne said, plus can also post to teaching/educational sites/forums.~  One this that was done on another KS I backed, and was wildly successful, was to give away -free- rewards to -schools- and other nonprofits They posted this fact to a few forums, and word got out fast.~  The way it worked was, for every 10 regular KS supporters, they'd give another reward to a school. Schools had to write to the creator to apply for the freebie. That part was independant of the KS schedule, because it's not a typical KS feature..~  This is harder to do in this case because the 'educational' package, 12 bots, is a lot to give away. But maybe two or 4 bots wouldn't be too much of a burden.~  ANYTHING to get this project moving is a good thing!!!~  Might be time to see if you can get some mentions on some techie sites, like instructables or maker~  ",0,"$10,000",Smart Club Mini-arm: World's Smallest DIY Mobile Robot Arm (Canceled) by RoboInside — Kickstarter
331,"EPRAM is an intelligent heavy duty robot designed to help you control your pram. It has three main functions:Manual Function: EPRAM can be controlled by the wii nunchuk moving any direction as you wish, it save your strength when you push the pram. The maximum speed is set to be 1MPH. Swing Function: EPRAM automatically run by itself forward and backward just like a cradle and send your baby to sleep. So that you are free to enjoy your meal at the same time and you can also set up the timer on this functionFollow Function(under development): In this mode, the EPRAM can follow you in a short distance and identify the parent, so that you are free to do something else such as holding your baby or push the shopping trolley.The EPRAM drive the ordinary pram by frictional force between the wheels . And the functions are programmed in the processor(robot brain). In the Fig.1, the processor controls the two wheels of EPRAM, and receives the feedbacks from the sensors. The user can send command to the processor via the wii nunchuk. There are many processors I tried to build the EPRAM, such as DSP, PIC, Atmel AVR (Arduino). And finally, the manual and swing functions can be achieved by using the Atmel AVR processor. But the 'following function' need further development by utilizing more powerful processor to achieve the real situation awareness ability and detect the hazard. Fig. 2 shows the prototype of the EPRAM. The mechnical and electronic control has been completed and the next step is to improve the outlook design of the EPRAM.

This inspires me, an electronic engineer, why not to design a robot pram to do some tasks. The 'EPRAM' is the abbreviation of Electronic Pram.The safety of baby is the priority for every parents and so to us. The EPRAM is designed with 100% safety consideration and has robust steel shell. The maximum load EPRAM can carry is no more than 15Kg ( 1.5 years old baby) . The battery can last 0.5 hour long at the condition of flat surface with 15Kg load.Phase 1 Kickstarter                     Kickstarter Campaign, the amount of the interest will be registered on our database and the backer's can contact me for more information about the EPRAMPhase 2 Product perfection                    According to the orders from the backers, the preparation of the manufacture will be ready during this period.Phase 3 Manufacturing                          Maunfacture and prepare to ship.Phase 4 Shipping                                     Shipping the EPRAM, you can enjoy your EPRAM before Christmas.My name is Xu Chunyang, I am an electronic engineer and worked on many projects involving the hardware and software design for more than 6 years .  My research area is about the radar signal processing and automatic classification system design.

332,"I plan to release my Apeiros robot's hardware as open source under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. All of the software that I develop for Apeiros will be released under General Public License (GPL) Version3. I believe that this release strategy will provide end-users with the freedom to modify and extend Apeiros in new and exciting ways while also being able to look under the hood and learn about the designs!See update#5 for more information.See my project update#3 for more info. See my project update#1 & 2 for more information.Apeiros makes it easy for anyone to get involved with and become immersed in the world of robotics. Use Apeiros as a tool for teaching Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) + Art = STEAM. In
order to be truly useful a robot must be able to both sense and manipulate its
environment. Most robots can sense their environment and perform basic
navigation. However, only a limited number of robots can manipulate objects by
using various end-effectors such as a gripper. Apeiros has been professionally
designed using 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. A well-known hobby
servo is used to drive a truly unique optional gripper mechanism.Apeiros supports up to a total of (5) IR sensors; (3) in the front and (2) in the back. I have done my best to design Apeiros to be functional, but in a cost effective manner. In order to keep the cost of goods low l made sure that my robot body design was compatible with the injection molding process. The rear caster, (2X) GM8 gearhead motors and acrylic top plate are secured to the injection molded base using thread forming screws. Thread forming screws will form threads in the ABS plastic as they are tightened. Future Engineers will be able to examine mechanical prints and learn about Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T). Delve into the 3D models and design your own new parts for a custom application! If you have access to a 3D printer, then you can print your own robot body and/or create custom add-ons!Apeiros is entirely open source with respect to hardware and software, so you can examine and modify source code along with the electrical design files for my motor & sensor shield. I plan to release my Apeiros Robot's hardware under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. All of the software that I develop for Apeiros will be released under General Public License (GPL) Version 3.All future shield designs will be made available. I used ExpressPCB's design software for all my electrical board designs. ExpressPCB offers a low cost prototype service so you can easily modify the original design and get prototype boards ASAP. I have done my best to design with future expandability in mind. That is why I added headers J7 & J8, which will allow for the connection of WW12 wheel encoders. Additionally, you can add an optional high-efficiency 3.3 volt regulator to location U2 in order to support added sensors and future add-on shields. Of course, the stackable headers provide for nearly unlimited expansion possibilities via new add-on shields.Add a line following sensor and Apeiros can perform simple and complex line following tasks. I designed the injection molded base with two sets of mounting holes
for a popular 3-sensor (QTR-3A) or 8-sensor (QTR-8A) line following array.You can easily make Apeiros your own by customizing with wiggle eyes or numerous other forms of creative flare! Many people do not realize that creativity is very important when it comes to engineering, so go ahead and let your creativity shine!Programming ApeirosI decided to use the recently released 32-Bit STM32 Nucleo
development board (http://www.st.com/) as the ""brains"" for Apeiros. More specifically, I have designed
my motor & sensor shield around the Nucleo F401RE development board. The
Nucleo boards provide Arduino compatible headers, but also expose additional
I/O pins on what is referred to as the “Morpho” headers. In this way you have access to a multitude of inputs and outputs that can be configured in many different ways.Programs for the Nucleo board can be developed and
compiled online using mbed (https://mbed.org/). Once a program has been compiled it can
be copied over to a connected Nucleo board by simply dragging and dropping the
new program file.I intend to develop several basic example mbed programs, so that end-users can get started with Apeiros right out of the box. Using mbed will make it very easy for end-users to modify example programs and further extend their experience with Apeiros.Reward DetailsBasic Apeiros Body Kit - You get just the (1) injection molded robot body, (1) laser cut acrylic top plate, (1) 6-AA Holder, (2) GM8 motors, (2) wheels, (1) caster wheel along with various screws and hardware.

It can operate independently or in conjunction with an elevator. This can be seen in the F-lot example where the horizontal operation of the system can, but must not, be accompanied by a vertical elevator system. Furthermore, it is possible to complement/expand existing elevator systems with a UAV landing module. 

 Although the Interchanger-system was designed with a short range of 1 to 1.5 Km. in mind, it can be expanded to cover larger distances by creating a combination of different interchangers, shafts, corridors and elevators. Examples include the campus, shopping center, and the subway/underground metro.The Interchanger-system can transmit telemetry data, of shafts, corridors, etc., to other incoming autonomous transport vehicles so that they can be ready and increase efficiency.German:Das Interchanger-System ist ein horizontales Transportsystem und/oder Paketsystem. Es kann Aufzugsanlagen um die horizontale Bewegung ergänzen oder als eigenständiges System verwendet werden. Dasselbe ist mit der UAV-Landeeinheit möglich. Das Interchanger-System kann:
1. den horizontal Transport von Waren und Personen ermöglichen; 2. Lande-, Lade-, Triangulationspunkt und Übergabestation von Paketliefer- UAV‘s in den Aufzugsschacht bzw. der Kabine.
Die UAV-Landeeinheit steht als Ladestation für andere UAV's zur Verfügung. So kann eine lange Flugdistanz mit einem UAV zurückgelegt werden.Von Landeeinheit zu Landeeinheit wird der Akku geladen!
Das Interchanger-System ist modular aufgebaut, es kann selbständig oder in Verbindung mit einem Aufzug funktionieren. Der horizontale Betrieb ist z.B. bei F-Grundstücken auch ohne vertikalen Betrieb durchführbar, somit können lange horizontalen Distanzen ohne Zufahrtsmöglichkeit bewältigt werden. Es ist möglich, bestehende Aufzugsanlagen auch nur mit dem UAV-Landemodul zu ergänzen bzw. zu erweitern.
Das Interchanger-System ist an sich nur für kurze Strecken ausgelegt (max. 1-1,5 km), jedoch kann durch eine Verbindung verschiedener Interchanger-Schächte/Gänge und Aufzüge ein komplexes Transportsystem geschaffen werden. Als Beispiele seien hier Campuse, Einkaufzentren, Bahnhöfe und Ubahnhaltestellen aufgeführt. Durch temporär installierte mobile Interchangerschächte ist es möglich bei diversen Festivals schnell und einfach ein Transportsystem (Zubringer vom Parkplatz) aufzubauen und auch wieder abzubauen. Gewaltige Parkschäden und Flurschäden auf Äckern und in der Natur können dadurch verhindert werden. Das Interchanger-System kann durch Schacht-,  bzw. Ganginformationen Telemetriedaten an andere einfahrende Transportvehikel übermitteln, um somit den Schacht für andere autonome Vehikel bereitzustellen und so die letzten Meter zum Kunden zielsicher zu navigieren.

I am going to have to count my pennies to get me one of these.""""This is a really awesome project. I can only imagine the planning that went into the design of the circuit board alone.""""Electronics for Everyone!""Most other educational platforms on the market today are either extremely expensive, or lacking in features. We saw plenty of solutions that were affordable, but lacked the functionality to grow with the user. We wondered: Can we create an easy to use, low-cost platform that was also full featured and would grow WITH the user? Our dream is to create an affordableopen-source STEM platform that grows with the skill level of the individual using it. Something that is as useful to an elementary school student as it is to a university student, enabling people of all ages to explore those fields more freely than ever without having to spend a lot of money to do it.To bring our dream to reality, we created Muribot. A $250 dollar robotic platform, that is nearly as cheap as a Mindstorms NXT, but with features comparable to one you might use at a university lab. We've packed this platform with an amazing set of features and functionality:ARM/Raspberry PI/Arduino Compatible!By installing the I2C slave firmware ANY third party hardware that has I2C capabilities can take control of the Muribot! All the sensors are on the same exposed I2C bus, so your hardware will have access to ALL of the platforms sensing capabilities! And with our 3D printable mounting bracket, you can make sure you get a secure fit to our platform.With Muribot, you're only restricted by your imagination!!As part of building and designing Muribot, I've spent the last two years and nearly $5,000 of my own money towards refining the design, packing more features into a less expensive platform until I had the low-cost high-quality product you see here today.Muribot is for students, hobbyists, and researchers. It was designed for people of all ages to explore STEM concepts and learn about robotics and coding. When you buy a Muribot, you get something comparable to a $4,000 platform. Muribot is a great resource for teachers and educators, and is the perfect complement to any Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) curriculum. Muribot can be used to explore basic concepts such as:And some more advanced concepts:Muribot is different from other educational robotic platforms due to it being a university level platform that's designed to grow with the individual. The included API allows inexperienced users to easily explore robotics concepts without the complexity of learning how to use an embedded platform. A more experienced user could opt to control the hardware directly and forgo the library altogether.Lightweight, Durable, and Compact packageWith the only additional hardware being a USB cable the small size makes Muribot easy to transport and the hard outer casing means Muribot can survive and accident or two. Our cases will be printed on a Form1+ printer and will be very ABS-like in terms of durability.Cross-Platform, Open-source and Hacker friendlyWe are built on the shoulders of open source giants, so it would only make sense to make our hard work open source as well. MuriProg is written in C using Qt making it easy to compile for Linux or Mac; you just plug-in, install, and start programming no matter what OS you have!We designed the Muribot be user repairable and to use as many common and readily available components as possible, as well as making it easy to access our I2C bus and 3.3V line without having to modify the mainboard itself at all.If you support our project, it will help us to truly bring Muribot to life and to the world. We will be able to purchase the equipment and enough supplies necessary to create them quickly, efficiently, and easily; as well as spend more time focusing on getting Muribot out into the world in general. We believe in the open source movement, and if we're successfully funded we'll be releasing all the files to create a Muribot online, for anyone to use to build their own Muribot.By supporting us, you keep control of the company away from a bunch of greedy investors, who may or may not understand our dream and vision as well as we do.Facebook! - http://www.facebook.com/moarobotics/Twitter! - http://www.twitter.com/moarobotics/Of course, the best way you can help us is by getting the word out! Sharing our project on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social media is really the greatest thing you could do to help with this and future projects. AND we will be forever grateful for your assistance in spreading the word.One thing we feel strong about is being open with you, the backers. A lot of Kickstarters do not disclose how they are going to use the funding they receive. We've done a lot of research into successful and failed Kickstarters to determine exactly how we should go about planning it, and pitfalls we should avoid.Currently the thing we are in the greatest need of right now is a couple Form1+ printers. We priced injection mold tooling for the Muribot case. Tooling costs $8,000-$17,000 dollars, and when compared to the cost of a new Form1+ ($3,300)  it's easy to see which way to go. The Form1+ is simply superior in price, and it can print complex and thin parts which we require not only for Muribot but for other products we're designing.Another big factor is simply the fact that to facilitate the mold tooling would require us asking for nearly $20,000 dollars more. We're not greedy and we simply couldn't risk spending any funding on what could become a $17k paperweight.If we're going to be building and shipping these robots we'll also need lots of supplies, things for shipping like boxes and packing materials; Electronic components such as PCB boards, resistors, sensors, etc.; and miscellaneous supplies like product manuals and USB cables.The Form1+ uses a UV resin that isn't cheap and will make up a bulk of our ongoing production costs, as well as other supplies to facilitate the printing process. There may also be maintenance costs for these machines, as they will be doing a lot of work.Backer Fulfillment The most important thing for you that we will be spending money on will be fulfilling backer rewards so if you support us at bronze or above you actually get what you wanted. Based on our research and from our own projection, we've found that about 75% of the funding we receive will be used to build Muribots for our backers. This was expected, and our funding goal matches that expectation.I've spent a lot of my own time and money refining the process to be as low-cost as possible, so that I can give you our assurance that if you support Muribot you WILL get your reward as promised.Delivery will be divided up into four distinct phases: Funding, Purchasing and Receiving Supplies, Assembly and Testing, Packaging and Shipping. Each of these phases are discussed in more detail in Risks and Challenges.Based on the above numbers, a tentative estimate to delivery completion would be 8-15 months.  We feel this is a nice safe number that will give us breathing room; in the end if we finish ahead of schedule that's all the better.Our philosophy here at MOAR is “Electronics for Everyone!”- We believe an educational robot could be an amazing tool to spread interest in the programming, electronics, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. We have designed Muribot with parents, educators, kids, robot enthusiasts, and researchers in mind. We hope that Muribot will lower the barrier into those fields and cultivate a whole new generation of scientists, programmers, and engineers.About Michael Stone Michael Stone is Founder, CEO and President at Mid-Ohio Area Robotics where he designs affordable educational and hobby electronics for people of all ages.

337,"“Science is
the WHY of things; technology is the HOW of things; and art is the MEANING of
things.”-- KEVIN PAGE Artist and
InventorEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: DOTY is a project to build a robot that teaches and inspires K-12 kids about STEAM Education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math).  Many approaches to capturing kids interest in STEAM subjects have been tried, but the DOTY Robot is unique in that it uses science and technology in the CREATION of art!THE DOTY STORY: Hello.  My name is Kevin Page and I am the inventor
of DOTY the Painting Robot.DOTY is the
result of years of scientific research and know-how applied to one problem
(pointillist painting) that became a solution to another problem (STEAM
education.)  Here is the story:Several
years ago I was approached by a scientist that had developed a robotics system
for making oil paintings in an arcane painting style called pointillism.Over the
next couple of years, the scientist and I developed a new version of the
technology that took advantage of my expertise with
color manipulation in the digital domain (I had been a documentary filmmaker
and digital editor for more than a dozen years previously.)  We collaborated on the filing of two US
patents, one of which has been awarded and the other is still pending.  At the beginning, we focused almost exclusively on the technology as a fine art tool or ""paint brush.""DOTY the S.T.E.A.M. Engine is BornAt the same
time as the above story was unfolding, I was made aware by some of my contacts
in education about the burgeoning movement called STEAM in American education.(STEAM is an acronym that stands for Science,
Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics.)Across the country, teachers and administrators are
coming to similar conclusions: art informs science, technology, engineering and
math (STEM) and vice versa.  Consequently, they are pioneering new methods
of teaching that combine disciplines which have been isolated from one another
under traditional educational models.In short,
the argument goes: American kids aren’t showing much interest in “hard science”
at least as compared to students in other countries.  One solution for this is to try and change the
way we teach all of these subjects in
schools. STEAM education, in a broad
sense, is an attempt to integrate
these seemingly divergent fields into a wider understanding of the world.For some
reason, these ideas captured my imagination and hit me in a very personal
way.I had a daughter in grade school and had self-educated my way through
a number of different careers by this point, so on some very deep level I “got
it” right away. So the idea
came to me, “Why not use the DOTY robotics platform, which creates art using science and technology along with an artist’s
creative vision, as a way of teaching by
example this fundamental idea of integration?”  I decided to offer kids an experience of
science and art that was similar to what I went through personally during the
developmental journey with my DOTY art system.  (See related article: “Kevin Page New Pointillist Painter"")The idea was
to introduce DOTY to K-12 students in the classroom and develop a number of
hands-on activities that would have engaged kids in project-based learning activities
that, in turn, would have been integrated back into the existing curriculum
for science, math and art.We were
going to build the classroom model of DOTY out of brightly colored anodized
aluminum. We even had rough designs.  It was going to be COOL!

We
made our pitch to schools, universities, museums and art galleries.In some cases we had a series of meetings
that stretched on for months.  We sat on
committees and gave talks on the subject.But in the end, everybody that heard about DOTY wanted the product…yet no one, at least where we were looking, had
the money to pay for the product.  The in-class ""push"" model of distribution was starting to seem unlikely.DOTY the Painting Robot EvolvesAnd then, Kickstarter came along.  We decided to build a
new DOTY robot specifically configured for educational deployments in museums
and commercial environments (the ""pull"" model of distribution).  With the funds that YOU are essentially providing us, we are
essentially skipping the large institutions, that we hope someday will become
our customers, and building DOTY ourselves. 
Pure grass-roots social entrepreneurship!We plan to create materials (that can more easily be distributed to students than an in-class robotics lab) like a book and series of Internet-based videos that tell the DOTY story and engage K-12 students on a visceral-levelSo if you
see us on social media or happen to visit one of our websites about DOTY and
STEAM education, please support us and help spread the word with a “share” and
“like”.We are counting on our grassroots
friends to help us bring DOTY to the world.AND we're offering some VERY unique REWARDS to our supporters!",Kevin Page,"$5,136",Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on Oct 19 2014,Project MOVED.

338,"I sat there after the party had ended watching the pool steam up in the cool evening, counting the money that was going up in smoke. It wasn’t the first time and it seemed that there was nothing I could do about it. To add salt to the wound, I would have to vacuum the pool the next day and the day after as sand and leaves blew into it. It was getting a little cumbersome and although I liked having a pool and at times even enjoyed taking care of it, this was not the best way to spend my time or money.So I did what every rational pool owner would do and purchased a pool cover, one that came on a big roll and would easily pull out to cover the smoking water. Nope, it was not as easy as I thought. I needed a second person every time to pull it straight and that is if I remembered to do it. So after the first few times the roll sat there gathering its own dust. Not to mention that it was an eyesore. Most of the enjoyment one derives from the pool, is the ambience it creates, the pleasant glow in the evening, the atmosphere when you have guests over. No room for eyesores. So off it went.That was 3 pools ago. I got smarter. $5,000 later, I built in a beautiful pull-out in the deck itself, encased it in concrete and topped it off with a nice aluminum cover. Now the eyesore was gone. And I would show the world how easy it is to cover the pool and not waste precious resources. And of course not have to clean it as often as the neighbours. That almost worked, for a while I pulled the cover over the pool every night and opened it in the morning so the kids could get in and out as they pleased. That is until a few times later when the strap I was pulling broke. A strap later and a few choice words I continued the time consuming routine for a while longer. But by now the mechanism was getting tough to unwind and eventually the cover itself ripped where the strap met it. I’ve had it. The pool would stay open from there on and I would swallow a little harder every time the monthly $1,000 heating bill would come in.There had to be a better way. A little research later I discovered automated covers that would run on rails and all I had to do is push a button. But those rails would have to be on the deck since I had a kidney shaped pool. And of course that would make it butt ugly, not something I would entertain. At least that’s how I justified it to everyone once I saw quotes approaching $20,000.Until one day it hit me – I would build a robot to take care of this chore.My background is in technology and I have built projects for fun and profits utilizing leading edge hardware and software components in the past. This couldn’t be that tough. So I walked around the block 300 times over the next week working out the kinks of the system in my head. The first few virtual designs were discarded of course and lo and behold, the sexiest one percolated to the surface. Countless prototypes and a lot of component testing later plus a ton more research brought us where we are today. Roboblanket was born and there is no turning back. The pool will be covered!Roboblanket was derived from an audacious, borderline crazy idea that a pool can be covered by an autonomous flying robot. It didn’t take long before that crazy idea became more plausible as I started experimenting with the design and individual components. Terrestrial robots were considered, fancy loading and unloading mechanisms, electric and gas engines, smart self-propelled floating tiles, hinged mechanisms and much more, only for most to be discarded and for Roboblanket with its current sexy design to be born.Roboblanket consists of a Base Station that handles all the storage and communications tasks, a workhorse in the form of an Aerial Drone flying the tiles to and from the pool, the Floating Foam Tiles themselves, masterpieces of current material science and finally, a Mobile Application that brings the whole process to life and communicates the status of the process to the pool owner.Opening the Pool To open the pool, click the OPEN POOL button on your mobile app. The app communicates to the Base Station where the action begins and the Drone is subsequently given its marching orders. The base station also communicates back to the App and reports a real time status, such as “Pool is now Open”.Closing the Pool To close the pool, click the CLOSE POOL button on your Mobile App. The App communicates to the Base Station and the Drone is dispatched to carry out its duties. The Base Station will communicate that the “Pool is now Closed” when the process is finished.The Base Station The Roboblanket Base Station is the conductor of the orchestra. A stylish “shed” where the Floating Foam Tiles are stored and where the Drone finds a home after its hard work, where the recharging happens and where the heavy processing is done. Add to it the serial communications from the “brain” back to the drone and a constant link to one’s wi-fi access point and you can see why the Base Station is the unsung hero of the product.We decided to make the Base Station not just a functional component but also a stylish one. Expect this old-fashion shed look-alike to blend in with most pool surroundings and if not, it can be hidden around the corner where it can live a lonely but very busy life.The look may be old-fashioned but its guts are definitely not that. The Base Station houses a Raspberry-Pi computer where all the action gets co-ordinated throughout the  choreographed covering  and uncovering process. There are also communication gizmos, such as a wi-fi connector and an xBee serial communication attachment. This allows the Base Station to talk to your mobile device for action requests and ongoing status updates. It also is in constant communication with the drone to initiate and track tile delivery requests and updates.The Base Station also houses the precise GPS positioning equipment. This equipment is part of how we are able to position the Drone accurately in space so we can drop and pick up the tiles. A GPS signal is inaccurate to a few hundred feet, however, a relative position to the Base Station is all we care about for our purposes. Getting the differential between the Drone GPS reading and the Base Station reading can give us accuracy down to the centimetre level (1/2 inch).The Drone lives at the Base Station when it is not dancing above your pool. That is the obvious place for the wireless charging apparatus so the Drone can be ready to go when it is called upon. The final dimensions of the Base Station are not set in stone yet but will rather evolve from the tile storage requirements which are also dependant upon pool size.The Floating Foam Tile Cover Roboblanket is made up of square foam tiles that are both pleasing to the eye and functional. Each tile is comprised of  soft, closed-cell foam that is  vinyl-coated, for a long-lasting and heat conserving life.Once a tile is delivered onto the pool surface using the accurate GPS system of Roboblanket, the Drone de-activates the electro-magnet that was used to keep it tethered during its short flight. The tile drops to the surface and it then locks itself onto the next tile using small magnets that are embedded into the tile itself. There are also markings on the tile that the drone scans using its camera and decodes them to identify the tile and place it according to its stored grid. Picking up the tile works in reverse.Aerial Drone The Aerial Drone is definitely the star of the show, the vocalist, the muscle and the dancer all in one. The Drone resides in the Base Station for most of its life, wirelessly charging its batteries until it gets the call to action. That call comes from the Mobile App in the form of “Open Pool” or “Close Pool” command.The Drone is outfitted with 6 electric motors controlled by circuitry that varies power to each motor, thereby propelling it and stabilizing it throughout its trip to and from the pool. The battery lasts for approximately half hour, plenty of time to do its job and return to base for hibernation and recharging.It is also outfitted with a GPS receiver, accelerometer and gyroscope to position it accurately in space. It gets a little help from the Base Station in the form of a GPS variance signal, which really means that it corrects for the inaccuracy of GPS signals. This setup allows to position a tile with centimetre accuracy (1/2″).To communicate with the Base Station the Drone carries an xBee serial communication module. It allows it to send and receive data to and from the Base Station in real time so as to co-ordinate the tasks.Additionally, the Drone carries a tethered grab pad which contains an electromagnet. This magnet is activated when close to a tile thereby picking it up and deactivates the magnet when the tile is onto the pool surface.The brain of the Drone is based on a variant of  Arduino, a circuit that gives it its smarts and  the ability to control its peripherals, process light tasks, effect the autopilot and finally handle all the failsafes when events arise that are out of the ordinary, such as high winds, tile not found, obstructions, low battery, etc.The Drone also carries a camera that allows it to identify the QR codes imprinted on the tiles. This in turn allows the Drone to identify where that tile should be placed, based on the stored map it carries as a result of the setup process.We are building the Drone with durability and reliability in mind, first and foremost. Lift capability is also something built in to the design and balanced with rigidity, engine power and cost.Finally, the Drone is inherently beautiful but we make it more so with vibrant colours and component design, because let’s face it, this is a masterpiece that will be shown off again and again to family, friends and guests. A star performer, a brilliant executioner and the one component that gets disproportionate credit.Installation Roboblanket needs to go through a one time installation process. Tiles are positioned  in the pool manually for the first time. The edge tiles are trimmed using a standard razor blade, the foam is easy to cut through.Once everything looks proper and the tiles are securely positioned, it is now time to fly the Drone over the pool in “training mode”. Starting from the Base Station, the Drone will store the “Home” location which it will return to in the future. The Drone then proceeds to the pool area and stores the path it takes to get there.  It will use this path many times over its life so it is best to select a path that is free and clear of obstructions now and in the future. Once over the pool, it flies over the entire length of it and identifies the tiles, each tile is specially marked, and the grid is stored in memory. The accurate GPS position relative to the Base Station is also stored so each tile can be placed extremely accurately in the future. Certain tiles are interchangeable, such as the middle square tiles and those tiles are flagged by the software. This will allow the Drone to use any available tile for those positions, but ONLY the specific tile for the edges. Once the training flyover is done, the data is now available for all future openings and closings. The grid will be reproduced accurately every time. Training is over.We really need your help to bring this exciting product to life.  Our goal is to raise $250,000 which be used to fund research and development and setting up the manufacturing. We anticipate that approximately 50% of the funds raised will be used for research and development, iteration and refinement of our models, selection of the proper foam tiles, drone development, base station design and finally the software development that will bring all this together into one homogeneous, always on, fully synchronized product.

The other half of the funds will be used for setting up the manufacturing process, some components will be manufactured in-house but most will be outsourced to manufacturing partners.  Manufacturing of the incentives committed in this campaign will be funded by this “half” of the funds raised. We expect to enter the manufacturing part of the project very early in the New Year and we anticipate delivery of the product by early 2015, just in time for the northern hemisphere pool season.

We must accomplish missions to prove the worth our our robot when competing against others. Why We Need Funding: The parts we use to build our robots are quite expensive. This year, we spent so much developing, building and repairing our robot, and parents cannot keep on funding the team. This money is necessary not only for parts, but for tools and field setup kits.

340,"The video above: The Follow Me, Robot app (in development)    _________________________________________________________We suspended our efforts on this Kickstarter campaign early, when it became clear that our preparations, extensive as they were, had not attained the level needed to  truly strike a chord with the market for our product – and occurring as it did so far in advance of the actual availability of the SR15 Smartphone Robot™.  We can and will fix that in a re-boot to our effort – quite possibly in a very different and exciting form – within the next six months – much closer to our planned first production.

We hope we have piqued your interest enough for you to sign up via the Mail Chimp form on our website, to get a couple of brief milestone messages and an advance notice of our Kickstarter re-boot.

 As always, we look forward to serving you.

 Yours,
Joe Bosworth,
CEO, Smart Robots, Inc.
November, 2014_________________________________________________________Very much like the two ""chess players"" in Franz Steiner's image of a humanoid robot and his chess partner above (neither bearing any resemblance to the SR15 Robot - see Section V. Look and Feel below), you become the teacher and the SR15 Smartphone Robot™ is your student.With Smart Robots, Inc.’s robot apps and those you and/or your friends develop - plus the SR15 Smartphone Robot™ - you will be learning skill after skill, while teaching your robot many of those same skills, and having fun in the process.If you have ever wanted a “real” robot, what is it about the SR15 that would make you want to back this project at a level to get a robot for yourself, or with your team or group? 

(1) It's a big robot that can fit and work in the real world without getting stepped on or stuck under a chair. 

(2) We at Smart Robots do all the work to build the base, integrate your Smartphone (selected Galaxy, iPhone and Nexus models) with the robot hardware, and prepare the robot to host your applications. 

(3) All you do is write a smartphone app or as many as you like – or install and/or build one or more from our free open source robot app library, and also get them from third party developers.  Gain the benefits of not only the hardware on your phone, but the rich and easy-to-use development environment and other 3rd party libraries already written for today’s smartphone (like OpenCV/vision recognition). So building or acquiring real robot applications is a breeze. And if you have never built an app before and would like to, we show you how.(4) We will be providing a number of standard apps already installed on your robot and available for upload to your Smartphone when you get the SR15, including Follow Me, Robot and others we are developing.People have dreamed of having a big as life robot in their life to be a companion and helpmate.  Steve Jobs who founded Apple Computer is known to have dreamed about building a robot from when he was a young boy.  Child or adult, what would you want your robot to be able to do, if you had a robot? Think about it.  When most people think seriously about it, like it could really happen, the answers start flowing.This is something that is about to happen and you can be a big part of it, by preparing to provide your first life-size robot with the loan of your Smartphone as a brain, whenever you want your robot to wake up and get going.  Your robot will also need your help to learn about you and to learn and acquire ways to become useful and important to you in your life.

When you back us at whatever level, be sure to click into the Comments selection at the top of our Kickstarter Project and leave your answer to…. If you had a robot, what would you want it to be able to do for you?
The SR15 is designed to operate initially with your Samsung Galaxy S4 or S5, your Apple iPhone 5s or 6, or your Google Nexus 5, placed on-board the robot when you are not using it for other purposes.  Mounted on and connected to the robot, your smartphone shares its considerable skills and capabilities outright with and through the robot, as the robot interacts in the world through a growing flow of Smart Robots Inc and third-party apps that will begin to be available with the robot's introduction.We must be able to manufacture a minimum of 1,000 SR15 robots, in order to have the economies of scale necessary to be able to purchase parts and build units inexpensively enough to be able to offer the prices of our units that are represented in this Kickstarter effort. Reaching our target in this effort will enable us to do that, while having a few units for others who come along.  Exceeding our target, to the extent we are able, we'll enable us to do an even better job in approaching our Sustainability Goals (See Section V) that we have set for ourselves.Your participation and donations in this fund-raising effort will kick-start the introduction of the SR15 Smartphone Robot™, with shipments planned to commence in Fall 2015. We will keep you posted regularly on our progress.  The Smart Robots SR15 Smartphone Robot™ Project Kickstarter campaign will fundFirst deliveries of the SR15 Smartphone Robot™ are scheduled to commence in Fall 2015.[NOTE:  Several of these functions are already be available from your Smartphone for when they will be connected to your SR15 Smartphone Robot™ when it starts shipping late next year. Others of these applications are prime candidates for early apps to be developed.][NOTE: These three activities presented above are a few of the classroom projects undertaken with SR4 Robots by students at Western Kentucky University in 2009] In the Fall of 2015....     Smart Robots, with your support, will be introducing three levels of the SR15 Smartphone Robot™, differentiated only by the applications they are loaded with when they arrive at your doorstep. More on the SR15 Navigator     So, what is behind the SR15 Navigator story and why is this happening now?  The short answer is that the advent of cars that drive themselves (to destinations, with passengers), is very much the same as robots that drive themselves in our homes or buildings (to destinations, for both routine and ad hoc tasks).  See for yourself at Google's Project Tango (future Smartphone) and a video, Matterport and a video, Intel RealSense, Microsoft Kinect (application), Apple, Metaio, and many others.Because mastery of navigation is the essential foundation for any intelligent useful autonomous mobile device going forward, we will be taking an extra four to six months to assure that (1) the 3D vision smartphone and/or other sensor products are on the market when we need them, and are themselves up to the task (some are demonstrating very close to the essential capabilities today), and (2) that our own navigation software for the SR15 Smartphone Robot™ is able to go through several cycles of evolution, resulting in a field-tested maturity of the SR15 Navigator when it reaches you.  In truth, we will very likely be supporting pilot projects long before April, 2016. We will let SR15 Navigator backers know about these pilots, and give you an opportunity to take delivery of your SR15 Navigator on a date of your choosing concurrent with the pilots.The SR15 Navigator pilot implementations will be operating under rigidly monitored continuous-improvement methodologies designed to advance the performance of the navigation technology's performance at client locations dramatically throughout the pilot period.  Needless to say, there will be significant STEM learning for all involved - student-teams, client-teams and our own support engineers alike.V.	What specific capabilities will the SR15 Robot inherit when mated with your smartphone?1.	In joining your smartphone to the SR15 Robot, the robot is designed to acquire, inherit and incorporate virtually all of the capabilities of your smartphone, depending principally on the features of your specific smartphone.  A generic list of these capabilities follows.2.	Upon joining your Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 Smartphone, your Apple iPhone 5s/6, or your Google Nexus 5, you can tweet, text or e-mail your robot from a second device (PC, Tablet, other smartphone), and trigger responses on or from your robot….3.	In joining your smartphone to the SR15 Robot, you can add to, develop for, and/or teach your robot new skills.

4.	In joining your smartphone to the SR15 Robot, your robot acquires the ability to join and interact with every other SR15 Robot on the planet, with whatever limits or no limits, as you (and they) choose – utilizing the Smart Robots Open Robot Network™. This means that your robot can….

5.	Another technology that has the potential to make great contributions to your experience with the SR15 Robot is 3D Printing which potentially places untold possibilities into the hands of you and/or other users and app-developers for the SR15. The depth and reach of this potential is barely hinted at, in the following links: 
 At the same time, your smartphone will acquire capabilities from your robot, starting with:

 There will be much about the “look” of the SR15 Robot that is functionality-driven (“form follows function”) and that will further improve the payload carrying capacity of the predecessor robots to the SR15 pictured below.Viewing from the top left corner, left to right:Count on us spending design time on coming up with a fresh aesthetic look to the robot – simpler, but with even more excitement about it.With the SR15, we stay connected with our roots, with the understanding that the most useful generalized robots are those that have both “cargo space” for add-on's, and that are fully programmable for a variety of tasks.So while the SR15 will be designed to be attractive and interesting, it will also be able to pack a lot of gear. That gear will be invented or added by you, ourselves and others, building upon the SR15 and your smartphone’s combined capabilities. User supplied: Your Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 or your Apple iPhone 5s/6 or your Google Nexus 5 Smartphone..SR15 Smartphone Robot™: Optional: Amplified speakers and Bluetooth headsets will be highly recommended add-on options for your SR15 Smartphone Robot™Two initial application add-on options, also highly recommended,will be (1) the 8-station 360-degree surround proximity sensor app, and (2) the 30 LED signalling and aesthetics app. These are bundled in what we anticipate to be a significantly preferred rate at our $1,495 (plus shipping) Kickstarter Reward Level.  We do not have a reliable rate to project for these applications, beyond this Kickstarter effort., for now.In the 1980’s, in an earlier firm, RB Robot Corporation, founded in Colorado by our current CEO, we ran two friendly competitive parallel assembly lines and achieved production rates at our peak of an RB5X fully assembled and ready for test, packaging and shipping, every 15 minutes.  This rate of production would enable us to readily handle the 1,000 unit minimum target we have set for our Spring-Summer 2015  SR15 production.

When we get to the production of many thousands of SR15 units, our manufacturing methods will have to change significantly – and they will.  We all know that both our computer and our smartphone manufacturers are all doing millions of units at a time. So we know all this is doable.  Also, in the early 1980’s, we were privileged to be able to tour an early production facility of the Apple II computer in Ireland, and witness how another early manufacturing firm was reaching for high production rates.  And that was a long time ago.

Now, we are interested not only in high rates, but in how to do this work with an evolved Corporate Responsibility that meets the world where we find ourselves today.

We wish to build the SR15 in an energy-retrofitted Net Zero Energy facility with zero carbon energy emissions.  Further, we would like to get a jump-start on building our initial SR15 units with at least (1) some recycled input materials and (2) producing at least some very modest level of recyclable components, or parts of components.

It will take more than 1,000 SR15's for us to be able to afford the dedicated personnel required to assure that we can put a strong dent into our sustainability goals in just the 10 to 11 months we have from today – and to have such assembly lines up and running in a sustainable energy facility, with methods beginning to reach for sustainable products.

But our overall sustainability objectives are all within the realm of possibility with today’s sustainable building and manufacturing technologies and the collective experience of firms working in these ways around the world.

Nevertheless, the road we are already on for the next year and beyond, to bring the SR15 Smartphone Robot™ to you, is an important challenge and one we are highly dedicated to.


Our paths in this, as far as time-frames go, are now in your hands.  Either way, you now have a fuller sense of our Corporate Vision for the SR15.  We look forward to it becoming your vision too.
Backers and customers of the SR15 Smartphone Robot™ will receive our first Corporate Sustainability Annual Report for 2015, early in 2016.  You will also receive more news of this throughout 2015, as we embark at one level or another, in this direction.

344,"Medical emergencies happen more often than you think. Almost all medical emergencies have a critical time on them. These emergencies include but are not limited to cardiac emergencies, diabetic emergencies, and even severe allergic reactions.Imagine a system where a wearable device such as a watch, heart rate monitor, or even contact lens could detect your emergency before you could. Imagine a system that would alert you to this emergency and activate numerous response units to your exact location, including EMS, a community based response unit, your emergency contacts, and even a medical drone. Now stop imagining and start backing us....DroneCast has been providing aerial advertising and promotional services, we developed a revolutionary drone application and were the very first to successfully incorporate it into daily life. Although we can go to private investors for something like this and easily get funding, we don't want to lose sight of the actual goal here... to save lives! If we involve investors, they will simply want to see it being monetized. As soon as this happens, the quality of the product decreases and the original goal is lost. This is why we want to have the kickstarter community involved. We not only feel that this community will see the extraordinary value in this system, but will also be able to provide vital feedback on how the system should be developed. After all, it could be saving your life or loved ones, you should be able to have a say in what you would like! We want your continuous input! Please send all feedback to KSFeedback@DroneCast.com or call us at 215-717-9677 or contact me DIRECTLY at 813-693-2278! We will take all of your feedback into consideration!!Everyone is talking about ""the next big thing"" such as drones, wearable devices, and smartphones. We are taking these ""big things"" and combining them to make ""the biggest thing"" for emergency medical care since the creation of EMS. This system will add critical time to emergency situations where every second counts. Although we will be launching the system to initially work with cardiac emergencies, it is capable of assisting in countless other emergencies including but not limited to diabetic emergencies, trauma emergencies, and even severe allergic reactions. A wearable device, a smartphone app, 911 operations, community response, and a medical drone.The (point 1) smart watch or other wearable device (heart rate monitor for example) continuously captures heart rate and uploads to smartphone appSmartphone app (point 2) continuously analyzes data to detect an abnormal rhythm (in this case, abnormal heart rate) If abnormal heart rate is detected, user is asked ""are you okay"" and is informed of the abnormalityIf the user says ""Yes"" the app goes back to monitoring. If the user says ""No"" the app activates the ""DroneCast: Health"" response system (Community, 911, drone, emergency contacts). The ""user"" now becomes the patient.Anyone (who has our app installed with the ""available to help"" setting ""on"") within a 0.25 mile radius gets a notification stating the emergency and location. This ""superhero citizen"" (community response - point 3) can choose to accept or decline the ""call of duty"" after 2 hero citizens list themselves as responding, the others in the area get a notification saying the situation is under control. ********LEGALITY: A law in the US called the ""Good Samaritan Law"" which basically states as long as you are acting to the best of your abilities/knowledge you CANNOT be held responsible if your life saving efforts do not work. Users should feel comfortable due to this law.***********At this point 911 response (Police and EMS - point 4) is on its way, fighting through traffic or traveling a long distance.While en route to the scene of the emergency, the hero citizens get a quick tutorial on how to handle the emergency (in this case CPR steps). The medical drone (point 5) has been deployed to the exact location of the patient based on GPS coordinates of the smartphone sent through the app. Within minutes, the drone (capable of flying in most reasonable weather conditions) will arrive at the scene of the emergency, drop off the medical equipment and fly back to the charging/docking station.The hero citizen uses the equipment delivered to start life saving maneuvers until EMS arrives. In a situation where every minute counts, this could mean the difference between the patient living or passing away! (NOTE: If an untrained community responder has to use equipment such as an AED, they may do so! The AED is developed in a way that it can only provide the shock when required, therefore there is little to no damage a community responder can do. There is countless benefits the community responder provides)At this point, EMS and police would arrive (on average between 10-15mins after placing call). The lifesaving maneuvers would be taken over by EMS and the patient would be transported as usual to the hospital.As you can imagine, it isn't easy to develop a system like this, it requires time and money to make it efficient enough for daily use. We have set the goal at $100K, this is just enough for us to release our smartphone app which will allow users to be apart of a community response system (activated by app) - we are aiming for a November 2014 launch for this. If we raise greater than $250K we will have enough funding to release the smartphone app that is compatible with heart rate monitors and other wearable devices, we will continuously update the app to be compatible with the latest and greatest wearable devices - anticipated January 2015 launch. If we are able to raise greater than $500K we will have enough funds to release the entire system including 5 drones that we will donate to cities across the country as an initial testing phase. For every additional $250KUSD we raise above the aforementioned $500K we will donate an additional drone to a city. Cities will be chosen based on feedback from you!

Apparently you're very able to.......  unless you come to the City Of Brotherly Love. Irony abounds.   The robot itself is not overly complicated..... ""HitchBOT has a bucket for a torso, blue swimming-pool noodles for arms and legs and a smiling LED panel for a face, protected by a cake saver. It wears yellow gloves on its hands, and wellies -- rubber boots -- on its feet. Inside is a simple tablet PC and some components from Arduino, the open-source electronics platform. Together, all the parts cost about $1,000."" (Exert from the article by Brandon Griggs of CNN).    A few of my tech savy friends and myself will be working to rebuild the robot.

351,"SPECIAL NOTE!This project has been picked up by a private investor.I wish to thank all family and friends who gave me support and advice.I am so blessed to have you wonderful folks in my life.WISH ME LUCK!!!!The goal of this project is to complete the functional prototype of an Enjoyable, Adaptable and Responsive Learning Companion.  ALPHA is an inviting and exciting character robot who gets smarter and more insightful with use. Alpha's personality evolves uniquely as he Learns About You and his intelligence grows through safe access to web resources and by Learning From You.
 
I am working on this project to take the design, electro-mechanical subsystems and responsive software that I have developed over the past years into a fully refined prototype of this intelligent, friendly companion.  The follow-on stage prepares for Alpha production and classroom use.About AlphaAlpha the robot communicates with your child and family members naturally. Your child will be comfortable engaging with Alpha's Calm, Helpful and Encouraging Personality. The robot's features and personality are based on the Robotic character in the graphic novel called Alpha and the CreatureBots.The story is set in future and from the point of view of Alpha's child-like digital mind. Alpha shares learning experiences and adventures with the new friends he meets while discovering the world around him. Alpha's character will appear in a series of Educational Activity Books in-which the Alpha Robot Interacts with your Child While Reading..With ALPHA Your Child Has A Patient Friend they can Read With or Read ToAlpha Is RelatableWhat makes Alpha Capable?The Market  The Alpha Robot is Targeted for Elementary School Age Children at home or in the classroom. The Alpha Character will be featured in activity books (to be sold separately) as well as the interactive media content on Alpha's touch screen chassis display.Why I am Seeking Funds I am seeking financial assistance to Complete a Working Prototype. With a working prototype I will be able to Prove the Concept and Test the Market. Kindly read the project details that follows or contact me and I will answer any questions you may have.When Successfully Funded I Can: Complete the PrototypeThe Alpha Robot prototype will be used to test the market interest by attending trade shows in both the home robotic and educational industries. Test and ImproveThe prototype will be tested with children and improvements will be made with the help and feed back from KickStarter pledges.Provide an Engineering Reference After successful completion of the project and prototype specs have been finalized. the Alpha Robot prototype will provide valuable data and reference to start engineering a pre-production version. Evolution of the Alpha RobotThe ambitious development of the Alpha Robot (as originally conceived) started first with the construction of the Alpha Robot Mock-Up. The design has evolved over the years while advances in key Robotic technology elements (Voice recognition, Sensors, Computer Processing Power) were improved. With successful advances of all key elements of Robotic technologies it is now possible to produce Alpha as envisioned. The following images and video clip is the original Mock-Up used to develop the A.I software and test some facial expressions methods.This Mock-Up version of Alpha (Clip & Images Above) was not intended for production design nor did it resemble the original character from the graphic novel. However, It was developed and used to create the Artificial Intelligence software and facial expression technics. This year I am reconstructing Alpha as I originally designed based on the robotic character in the graphic novel Alpha & the CreatureBots. Now I am ready to complete the fully functional prototype.About Alpha's Artificial Intelligence The Alpha Artificial Intelligence Software is a sophisticated natural language processor using unique methods for Natural Conversation. Alpha is among a product line I am creating called ""Creaturebots"". All will have this software.The following video clip is a brief example of the Artificial Intelligence conversation method and techniques. To demonstrate a brief conversation I used my video realistic head to more clearly visualize. The voice of Alpha the robot will be Child-like. This program was version 1 and has since been upgraded for the Alpha Robot. A version of this program will be sent to merit pledges.   As of 1/14/2015Alpha's A.I. software is ready for Beta testing.The Chassis, Skin and Base have been completed. Further work in progress and yet to be completed are Electronics, Computer System, Sensors and Displays. The Omni-wheels (mobile base) will to be re-made from 3-D printer. The Mechanism for the mouth and lip articulation will be fabricated by 3-D printer as well. The previous prototype of Alpha's eyes and eyelid were originally mechanical. However, on this updated version of the Alpha robot prototype I will use LCD displays instead that will enable Alpha more variety of eye expression through animation. In addition Application Software, Drivers and Calibration are included in the schedule. Brief summary of how I will complete the projectThe A.I. conversational software is ready to install for Beta testing once the robot hardware is completed. Work needed to get the robot completed is the functional and inner workings of the project (particularly facial mechanism). With success of raising funds for the completion of a working prototype (approximately 30 days) The prototype mechanically and cosmetic (skin) are done (as shown in the photos) and Electronics for the prototype maybe modals off the shelf components to save time, Project Funded (March 25th 2015)Once the goal of raising funds are met the funds to complete the Alpha prototype project are allocated this way.Project Completed (April 30th 2015)Completion of the project is estimated to be done around the end of the last week in April or the first week in May 2015.My intentions Beyond the PrototypeAfter this KickStarter project (Alpha prototype) has been completed successfully it is my hope to take it to the next step to make a Production version of the prototype. If feedback on the working prototype of Alpha is positive then the following is  my proposal to get a production version of the Alpha robot made. Producing production ready designs can be manage on a small scale using 3d printing rather than CNC. However, I would be prepared to produce Alphas the conventional method using molds if sales sample unit demand goes up. My proposal for production in this regard may go as follows:Production Funding Campaign StartMay & June 2015: Finalize all component modules and sourcing, Finish all tooling and molds, Finished 5 production designed samples before production.Production Funded  July 2015: Pilot production. Check all certifications and standards.  August, September & October 2015:Full production. Finalize the partner in distribution, Attend trade shows and events.November 2015: Start shipping.  December 2015: Customer support Release, Launch App Store & Server.Thank you so kindly for your interest in reading about my project description. The following is a brief description of Alpha and the Creaturebots. The story is currently published periodically in a popular robotics magazine in South Korea in both English and Korean.The Story of AlphaTo broaden Alpha's exposure and introduce the concept of CreatureBots I wrote a graphic novel about the little robot's adventures. Alpha and the CreatureBots is the story of an eccentric inventor (Mr. Cooke) well known by the local folks and neighborhood kids for his wacky toys, gadgets and robots he builds. After years of development Mr. Cooke completes a very intelligent animatronics creature he calls Alpha. The one thing missing is the very special A.I. brain. One day in Mr. Cooke’s lab an accident occurs when an insect falls into a substance connected to Mr. Cook’s computer and Alpha comes to life and Mr. Cooke’s program finally works. At first, Alpha is like a small child. He is curious, fascinated by the world and looks to Mr. Cooke to teach him. Alpha learns quickly but wants to know if he is “Real” like Mr. Cooke and other people. One day Alpha is stolen from Mr. Cooke by the evil antagonist of the story Mr. Burns who tries to copy Alphas unique computer brain to use as a military guidance weapon. Alpha escapes but is lost. With his memory damaged he struggles to find his way home. Along the way he meets some other fugitives’ robots and makes friends. Together they discover the world, people and themselves. Alpha must find his creator and understand the burning question of what it is to be “Real”… He must find “The Wizard of West Bloomfield” to get the answer.Alpha is the protagonist in the story. He is a passionate Artificial Intelligent Animatronics “Creature” with emotion (Not necessarily a typical robot because of this trait). He sees everything in the world as a wonder but wonders about his own existence in he world as it relates to Humans.The following clip is a preview of the graphic novel ""Alpha & the CreatureBots Featuring Miss Christina Dixon singing Alpha's song Am I Real  I am a High-Tech consumer product designer, Artificial Intelligence researcher and writer... Ah Heck! ... I am really just an artist. However, I've worked in product development and manufacturing focus primarily on interactive high technologies with empathize in artificial intelligence, animatronics and Robotics. I have a passion in Artificial Intelligence, l have great interest for Animatronics and the development of interactive educational applications in media technology for children. This is why I made a career in high-tech toys.  I've been preparing a long time to contribute to what I feel will the next big thing... The Home Robotics industry.With your help and support I can make Alpha & the CreatureBots a success and a life long time dream come true. Thank you kindly,Donald Dixon",Donald Dixon,$0,Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on Feb 19 2015,Your Child's Learning Companion and Personal Conversation Buddy,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,0, ,0,"$16,000",ALPHA: A Friendly Robot For Learning (Canceled) by Donald Dixon — Kickstarter

We expect the robot to be aproximately 4 feet long by 2 and 1/2 feet wide.  It will include heavy duty 4wd systems and tires to allow it to navigate rougher terrain.  It will be quite heavy for a number of reasons listed below.The robot will feature a few important systems to enable it to safely get from point A to point B.  The first will be a GPS system integrated into hardware on the device so the robot aways knows where it is.  It will also have an array of cameras at differing angles allowing the on board hardware to avoid obstacles and adjust on the fly as necessary.  Several audio outputs will warn people of it's proximity and ask for help if it happens to tip over (knocked over more likely).  We are working on a way for the robot to return to operation itself when knocked over and input on this would be helpful. LED lights will help with announcing the robots location.In terms of safety features for the payload, there are a number of security measures we plan on implementing.  First of all, an adjustable, high density/high strength material that will let the sender ""cage"" up the package being delivered.  If someone attempts to tamper with the robot beyond helping it when it asks, all motion will lock down, alarms will ring out as well as a voice announcing the intrusion upon the device. Smaller GPS systems will be included in the delivery payload in case the intruder somehow manages to detach it from the main body.  The robot will immediately activate these GPS devices and notify law enforcement of the precise location of the payload.  The payload itself will be very hard to access without being the intended recipient with the appropriate means of access and unique code.Now, I must stress that there will be no real opportunity for financial gain with this project.  Consider yourself investors who are buying in to the future of the project and the possibilities therein.I will be working with a team of engineers to make this first prototype and any future prototypes or projects for this system.If you think this is a good idea, PLEASE KICKSTART US!  We appreciate your donations  and hope that the future is very bright for this project and this robot.I MUST be very clear that our main picture IS NOT OUR ROBOT AT ALL!  I thought it looked similar to the main body of our future robot and the credit for the depicted robot in the photo must be credited to bizchip.com",Dan B.,$0,Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on Nov 1 2015,This automated 4wd robot (pic curtesy of bizchip.com).

354,"HYDRA is a unique hybrid drone which uses a small customized generator to power it's motors and on-board instruments. By using a fuel engine rather than a battery, HYDRA is capable of flying much longer than any battery powered drone. HYDRA can also lift up to 7 pounds of payload, which allows it to carry virtually any imaging system, sensor array, or custom payload you might need.HYDRA uses a specially engineered generator to provide the required power for flight. A 5 HP unleaded gas engine turns a custom built generator, which routes power through a regulator, then out to the motors, on-board computer and payload system. HYDRA also uses a custom built avionics computer, which receives data from an array of instruments on the drone, communicates with the ground controller, regulates the speed of the motors, and integrates with attached payload systems.HYDRA can be operated by either a traditional handheld remote control or a computer/mobile software app. The handheld remote gives you total control of the drone at distances up to 1 mile (line of sight), and will also provide a live video feed to a monitor or headset, assuming an imaging payload is attached to the drone. The software app has the same capabilities as the remote, but also allows you to specify predefined flight paths, view detailed telemetry and flight statistics, and stream video feeds to other devices.HYDRA features a specialized payload attachment port, which lets payload systems share power from HYDRA's generator, read telemetry data from HYDRA's on-board instruments, and even communicate with the ground controller over HYDRA's built-in radio. This fully integrated system, called Aerolink, substantially reduces the complexity of payload systems. We are developing a basic set of payload systems for the most common drone applications, including a pan/tilt camera package, meteorological instrument array, and a geological surveying system. All the information required to build your own Aerolink-compatible payload is freely available on our website.

355,"Why My Friend is needed.  In 2013 I got very sick due to Stage IV Cardiac Failure. I spent two and one half months in the hospital because of this. Yes the Doctors and Staff were very helpful and very kind. When they were there.  The majority of my time was spent listing to music and some television and by myself.  Needless to say I am not a patient, patient.The attached video is a graphic representation of what My Friend will be in the real world.I looked for many different ways to occupy my time.  Designed somethings for my previous employer, continued to write various articles and books. Yes this ate up some time, but for the majority of my time in the hospital I was alone.  And being alone in a hospital is no fun at all.  It was during this ""Down time"" that I realized that a robotic companion would be very helpful not specifically to help the Doctors and staff but more my own mental well being.  People that are alone for long periods of time become very depressed, which in turn can lengthen their stay in the hospital.As a continuation to this, my own father was in a nursing home for over a year before he passed away.  He too was alone much of his time as where many of his neighbors.  My shame in this is that he had raised my brothers and I better than we treated him in his final days left him waiting for the occasional visit or telephone call.It would have been so nice to have someone to carry on a conversation or read to me or play simple games.  It would have been nice to have a human caregiver do these things.  However, people cost a lot of money.  And the return on Human investment is typically limited.Rather than re-invent to wheel I have found an existing Robot Companion in japan called Pepper.  Pepper is made by Softbank and fabricated by Foxconn.  The Pepper Robot has a number of features that lend itself to being enhanced to meet the needs of people that are in Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Long Term Care FacilitiesThe funds I am looking for from the funding group is to enhance the the existing Pepper Robot and change into ""My Friend"" a true companion for the elderly and the infirm.The idea is to take the Pepper Robot away from a Marketing tool \ Mobile Kiosk.  And turn it into a true personnel assistant, primarily for the elderly and the infirm.

We plan on introducing students (ages 6+) to the technology of the future in an innovative way that makes learning fun and exciting. We will do this by taking a Go-Kart and installing electronic parts in multiple places around the car, under the front bumper, on the roof, on the rear bumper. Some of these electronic parts include LIDAR, Light sensing cameras, Linear motors etc. After installation We will connect all of these newly added parts to an on board computerized system that we have designed. The coding of this system will be done in National Instruments Labview. The Go-Kart will have an automatic emergency off switch. The instant the steering wheel is grabbed by the person in the drivers seat, the Go-Kart will automatically switch over to manual control. At this point the Go-Kart will act as if it was stock from the dealership with none of our additions. Once the driver lets go of the steering wheel, the system will immediately take back over, and return to being autonomous. ""Robotics is a porthole to a vast panorama of possibilities, therefore it is the mission of every engineer to offer the opportunity to be Inspired & Motivated by exploring the high tech world of Science, Technology Engineering & Math (STEM)."" ",Storm Bissar,$0,Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on Apr 6 2015,We are planning on building a fully autonomous car (Self driving car) to educate younger students to the STEM program.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,0, ,0,"$80,000",Autonomous car (Canceled) by Storm Bissar — Kickstarter
357,"Cyp is the first intelligent home security and stereo system. The Cyp Box is ready to sense distress in cases of home invasions and calls for help. Voice command will trigger an alarm to call the authorities. For individuals who live alone, Cyp can be programmed to check-in frequently to make sure he or she is okay and alert friends/family if the individual does not respond. The Cyp Box doesn’t just look like a stereo, it will play your music with quality sound – giving new meaning to the term ‘safe and sound’. Watch former BBC actress, Kellie Rose Demmel, bring the Cyp features to life! 

At CYPROMUS, we believe that the Residential Security market needs a major disruption. Technology has improved many aspects of our everyday lives yet the Residential Security systems that are available today have been around for decades. Many of them still run on old telephone lines. Many companies, large and small, have attempted and are still trying to change the game but they're really just a slight facelift of the same underlying products. At the same time, the tech revolution has created a huge divide between those in the tech industry and those simply consuming it. Using technology to improve the Residential Security market must also change the relationship of the consumer to the tech so that we're all empowered to contribute to the entities that are most intimate with our homes. 

The Cyp Box tackles both problems, creating a new Residential Security paradigm and getting the consumer to engage in the tech economy, by offering a platform that is open and customizable to each individual and family's needs. As a ready-to-run security system, the Cyp Box can use its microphones to listen for your distress calls and call for help. As a DIY robot and computing platform, Cyp's features can be enhanced at any time and by anyone. In fact, the Cyp virtual bodyguard software will interact with you to understand your security needs and provide the appropriate level of protection for you and your family. 

Besides offering assistance when you need it, the Cyp Box can use its full range stereo speakers to play music and other content. Interaction with the Cyp virtual bodyguard on a regular basis is the best way to ensure that if you ever need to use it in a time of emergency, you know how to activate it. Over time, the Cyp Virtual Bodyguard will gain more and more capabilities, as we'd expect any tech to do. Because the Cyp Box is modular, you can upgrade parts of it. That saves your wallet and our natural resources.  
We're raising funds for the injection molding costs for the Cyp Box Housing and the internal component housing.  Almost all DIY projects using Raspberry Pi's have all the wires hanging out and demonstrate a proof of concept.  The Cyp Box prototypes prove that having a complete unit that rivals any existing portable stereo systems out there and makes it a product that people want to own.  The Cyp Box housing is offered as a stand-alone perk for those DIY'ers that want to put their own components into an attractive and functional enclosure.  At Cypromus, we want users to engage their devices at the maker level, if they choose to.The Cyp Box Housing design is still undergoing several tweaks, mainly in the form of considering additional features such as carrying handles and expansion bays!  We are engaged with a manufacturing and engineering partner so the pricing and other factors are already baked into the prices you see here. The software is also undergoing development and Cypromus has a patent filed for its core security scenario.Immediately after shipping, Cypromus will release hardware and software upgrades and provide comprehensive monitoring and service plans on our website. Home monitoring starts at $8.88!
The Cyp Box is a modular robot with powerful full range stereo speakers powered by a 4-core Raspberry Pi2 computer. 
With software upgrades, Cyp will evolve and become capable and do much more for you and your family!
Cyp can be controlled by voice commands but can also talk to your mobile device. You can also connect an HDMI TV or monitor to interact with Cyp visually.Cyp can recognize your voice so when there is an intruder, you provide your secret passcode to trigger an alarm to notify local authorities and/or your emergency contact list of friend, family, and neighbors. You can program your emergency contact list to include friends, family, and neighbors, who will receive a message or phone call from Cyp when you're in trouble!If you live alone, you can program Cyp to check in with you frequently. If you don’t respond in a timely manner, Cyp will notify the authorities and/or your emergency contacts. Like other Cyp features, you control this feature with simple programming instructions!Cyp is the only device that response to your voice commands, checks in on you, and practices emergency procedures so you and your and your loved ones are always be prepared.CYP HOUSING - SELECT ANY THESE FOUR COLORS: THE NON-MODULAR BOX: THE MODULAR BOXES:Cypromus, Inc.

359,"Bob-E is a new virtual reality (VR) robot designed specifically to provide free movement and head tracking. It will change the way you think about telecommunication and remote presence forever. Bob-E provides a truly immersive experience that allows you to take part in activities like never before.The original goal of building Bob-E was to allow our friends and colleagues to take part in activities from a remote location. The side effect was that we created a friend.  Bob-E is more than a robot controlled by a human, he is a member of the community. No matter who controls it, he is fun to be with. He is always around, and he has an amazing personality.  Once you take control of Bob-E, you will feel what it is like, when people smile at you, and how you will become a closer friend to those around you. You will learn and experience things you would not learn or experience if you were there as a human. The only thing you will miss, is that you were not there with us from the beginning of this project. While we built Bob-E we had the best times of our lives. When Bob-E was created, the software developers, the electrical engineers and the 3D designers were all teasing and pushing each other, and this activity provided a great number of opportunities for fun and inspired outstanding achievement. We are now more passionate about building robots, then we were ever before. We have learnt to work together amazingly well. It would be great if you could join us for a day at our office and experience the atmosphere. We have added a reward to this project to be treated as an invitation for our biggest supporters.When you start to use Bob-E, you will be amazed at how easy it is to operate. You simply have to put your smartphone (Android or iPhone) into the VR headset and turn your head to look around. You will also have a small bluetooth controller (a joystick) in your hands that allows you to move Bob-E around the room. When you turn your head, the cameras of Bob-E will track every movement synchronously in real time. The robot offers fast, real time stereo 3D vision, that allows you to see what the robot sees just as if you were using your own eyes. The key feature of real time head tracking is possible, because Bob-E's cameras are super fast. The cameras follow your head movements at an amazing speed of 0.19 seconds / 60 degrees. If you think about it: it is less then a 1/5th of a second for an average head movement. We haven't heard about any other device that even comes close.The experience is also supported by Bob-E's physical design. Bob-E's cameras are exactly 65mm apart, just like the human eyes. This provides a wonderful, realistic 3D vision when you look through the VR headset. It is a true 3D experience.Bob-E is an excellent tool if you wish to use it in the office, or at an event and take part in activities from a remote location. It provides an amazing virtual presence capability. It allows you to go where you wish and look at what you want. The motors are powerful and the 3D vision capabilities and the optics / resolution of the cameras are designed to allow you to CapabilitiesPrivate useBusiness useWhen you get your hands on Bob-E you will see, that it's technology is state of the art. Bob-E's head movements are controlled by data collected from the motion sensors of the smartphone in the VR headset. These sensors track the head movement, and allow the software to instruct Bob-E through the network to turn his head. You will love that Bob-E can move around. To instruct it to go forward, backward, or to turn, a small wireless controller (a joystick) can be used. This controller talks with the mobile phone through Bluetooth.The following video demonstrates two modes for turning the front wheel. You can use the GUI on the mobile phone to make high precision movements. You may use the joystick to make fast movements. Notice that the webbrowser GUI captures the commands from the Bluetooth joystick, and highlights the corresponding arrows in blue, when a command from the joystick is received.To go forward or to reverse, both the graphical user interface and the joystick can be used. The graphical user interface can offer more precise, the joystick a more natural movement. Display: Bob-E's display can be used to display images. You may upload images to Bob-E using a webbrowser, and you may use the soft button on the joystick to switch between uploaded images. You may display a map, or a QR code at airport checkin, or any other visual information.One of the first thing you will notice, when you start to use Bob-E is, that he is the right height to look you in the eyes while you are sitting. This height is also optimal to read the documents on the desk. It is very funny when you control Bob-E and you turn your head and look at somebody after reading a page. People don't expect the robot to be able to quickly turn it's head and look them in the eyes. It was very funny, when Bob-E did this on one of our meetings, Peter, one of the team member was so surprised, he fell of his chair when Bob-E turned to him. It caused great laughter.When you use Bob-E, you will also enjoy that after everybody get's used to the robot moving around, you can sneak behind somebody and watch his computer screen. Unless they are prepared, they will not notice. This will give you the opportunity to see what happens in the office, what people are working on.Another nice feature is that you can make comments very politely using body language. You can use Bob-E's head to make gestures, such as the head nod up and down to say 'yes', and the head nod from side to side to say 'no'.Once Bob-E becomes part of the team, it is hard to imagine life without him. Bob-E is so much fun to have around, especially, it the person controlling it has a sense of humor.People interacting with Bob-E quickly treat him as a friend, because he is always interested in new ideas and listens carefully.We regret to tell you that some of our team members are lazy. It was an early requirement to equip Bob-E with a tray to carry drinks around. The first tray we used was not good enough because glasses were sliding around in it. The second was too small, it could only carry one glass. The third attempt was perfect. Now we have a non-slip tray that can carry several glasses.If you would also like to use Bob-E as a waiter you will love our non-slip tray kit! We will add this kit free of charge to all full size Bob-E Robot packages in this Kickstarter campaign. To see it in action check out the following video:If you are interested in technology, you might be interested to know that Bob-E is operated by a next generation robot control software based on the Ozeki Robot OS. This system was designed and implemented from scratch by our software developers. It took more than two years to build it. This robot control software allows full hardware control, parallel sensor and actuator management, it provides audio and video support and has outstanding communication capabilities. This operating system manages Bob-E's motion and vision by controlling it's stereo 3D cameras. In terms of hardware Bob-E has powerful components, check out the technical details:As a supporter of our Kickstarter campaign you can get a Bob-E robot for yourself. The complete package includes: Bob-E robot, a VR headset and a bluetooth controller. Please note, it does not include a mobile phone. You will have to put your own Android mobile or iPhone into the headset, but it supports every mobile with a webbrowser and a gyroscope.Developing a quality product is hard even if a great team is working on it. Problems that are difficult to solve come up, especially if such a technologically advanced product is built as Bob-E. Our team was not exempt from such issues. At one point, during a very hot summer evening, after long hours of work, one of our developers, Tom, was so tired and got so frustrated about a technical problem, that he said he will use his ""Jedi power"" and disassemble Bob-E into small pieces and will take Bob-E's head home. Although he is one of the most brilliant developers we have ever met, he did not have any ""Jedi power"" (luckily), and could not do any harm to the Robot. A few days later another colleague, David suggested, that maybe it is not such a bad idea. Since one of the most amazing features of Bob-E is head tracking and 3D vision, it might make sense to use Bob-E's head in itself, and to create a smaller, more compact product that can be used as an intelligent robot camera.We decided to call Bob-E's head ""Bob-E Mini"" and we listed it as a Reward in this Kickstarter campaign. Bob-E Mini is a super fast 3D robot camera, it provides the same 3D vision and head tracking capabilities and the same performance you can get from Bob-E. However, it is at a fraction of the cost.Bob-E Mini can turn it's head just us fast as a human. It provides an awesome 3D virtual reality experience. It is just as good, and in some scenarios it is better then the full size Bob-E Robot. Some areas where we think it is a better choice are:The advantages of Bob-E Mini areIf you compare Bob-E Mini to a full size Bob-E robot, you will notice, that it does not have a built in screen, a built in microphone and speaker and of course it cannot move around. (Note, that you can add an external microphone and speaker to it if you wish)On the other hand it has the same motherboard, the same CPU, RAM, Wifi and remote control capability and of course it also uses Bob-E OS. Bob-E Mini provides all the software and hardware interfaces needed for developers. Although it is designed to be used as a standalone 3D robot camera, it can also be used in your own robotics project.Bob-E Mini uses the same technology to move it's head that is used in the standard Bob-E Robot. It can track human head movement at a speed of 0.19 second per 60 degrees, and can move around in an angle of 180 degrees both horizontally and vertically (two degrees of freedom). It's cameras are exactly 65mm apart, just like the human eyes, to give a truly awesome 3D experience to it's user. The resolution of turning for both vertical and horizontal movements are 0.17 degrees. This make the camera very precise.You can use Bob-E Mini to look up, look down and look sideways. The camera will quickly track every little movement of your head. It is way faster then any PTZ camera you would normally find to buy and it provides a much wider angle of view then you can normally get.We encourage you to order Bob-E Mini and experience the freedom of remote presence. We have put together a package that helps you get started. We have included the Bob-E Mini super fast 3D robot camera, a VR headset and a bluetooth controller in the package. Note that we do not provide a smartphone with this package. You can use your iPhone or any Android phone with a gyroscope.Before you check the rewards, please watch the following video. We would like you to see that the biggest reward is that we can be part of this project. We hope that you can be part of this project as well, by making a pledge.We will include a Non-Slip tray kit with all Bob-E Robots, because we are sure you would also like to carry drinks around with Bob-E. This reward consists of a round 290mm diameter x 50mm high non-slip tray, and a strong
mounting kit that allows you to mount it on Bob-E. The tray has a brushed aluminium effect finish with a non-slip coated surface for greater 
ease of carrying & deep sides, designed with health & safety in mind, meaning that even at the busiest 
of times Bob-E can carry multiple drinks safely & securely Whoever doesn't want a t-shirt that says ""Bob-E The Future of Virtual Reality"" on it, well, 
there are others here too. We have designed this items t-shirt for you to be proud. You will feel joy whenever
you put it on, and you know, that you have contributed to make the future or 
robotics become a reality.  If you like the rewards please make a pledge now. We will deliver Bob-E Minis in February 2017 and the Bob-E Robots in March 2017. We have everything ready to launch the production, all we need is your support.At the end of the day your contribution will make the difference. You will give us the green light to go ahead and you will make it possible for us to bring Bob-E, the friendliest robot in the world, to you. Please be part of this journey and endorse our team. Make a pledge now!Can Bob-e handle rough terrain? Bob-E can go up slopes up to 10% in elevation, it cannot go on sandy beaches and tall grass fields. It cannot handle mud.
 What is the maximum battery life? One fully-charged battery will give Bob-E 30-120 minutes of continuous operation, obviously it is usage dependent. 70% of power is pulled by Bob-e's motors. Constant communication or human interaction will have very little impact on battery life!
 The battery can be easily replaced to extend operation time.Will there be an SDK (Software Development Kit available)? - We will provide a well documented API that exposes all the core functionality of the robot. It is our intention to build a community of developers, so you can expect great software developer support. Can the camera resolution be upgraded? - Bob-E uses standard USB cameras. You can replace the cameras to higher resolution. You must note, that higher resolution cameras will require more processing power and bandwidth. This will have a bad effect on battery life and might cause problems on lower bandwidth (mobile Internet) connections.Can Bob-e carry extra load? - The Bob-E motors used for movement are equipped with a gear box, so they are quite powerful. You can add an extra 5kg of weight to Bob-E without any issues. ",Bob-E Robotics,£957,Funding CanceledFunding for this project was canceled by the project creator on Sep 23 2016,"Bob-E, a friendly VR robot, that allows you to look around, move around and enjoy being there",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,4," hi guys,~  hope you're well.~  i've been giving this some more thought and am getting more and more excited about your project. could you please post up some sample footage from bob-e's camera? what is the maximum frame rate, bit rate and resolution of the footage? how loud are the fast head moving motors? do they retain their high movement precision at full speed, do you use a deceleration code towards the end of the motion....how does it perform?on bob-e mini, are there easy existing inputs for a microphone and speaker, and is there an interface that easily integrates the transmission of that data as well? what are the specs of the cpu, ram etc that is being used, and are these upgradable? would it be possible to get low level access to the image data (if that is even necessary??) to implement further computer vision capabilities beyond head tracking? are there open data data pins or compatibility with arduino (for example) so we can easily have the bob-e brain control additional motors and process data from IMUs and other sensors?you might be able to tell that i don't really know anything about robotics, but i have some ideas, and the easier it is to implement the better because i will already have a very steep learning curve.in terms of hardware, this seems like a really capable solution.would really like to see more examples and maybe some use cases would encourage some more conversation and hype around this campaign.~  best of luck for now! we still have a long way to go, but i hope we make it.~  ",0,"£75,000",Bob-E: A friendly Robot controlled through a VR headset by Bob-E Robotics — Kickstarter

Wether it is your kid, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, pet or anyone or anything near your heart, you will want to capture that moment, right? But by the time you pull out your phone, its too late. But in most cases, you record that loving moment and the video is bouncy, all over the place, which is the last thing you want to happen. This is why we created the Smart and Smooth Q Gimbal.Traditional Gimbals have a stick that you can hold on to, and a phone you can attach on top. Basically, a reversal of the selfie stick. And they don't help much, because a bouncy video will be a bouncy video in the end.The Smart and Smooth Gimbal integrates a 3-axis Gyro to help levitate your experience. What this does, is that it levitates your phone by constantly adjusting the angle of the phone, making the video eliminate bounce, and making the video look very professional.Here is a quick example of how this works! The River Scene is a great example of the excellent stabilization of the gimbal.A quick little fact: No instruction or training is needed to record like that!The Smooth Q also has a following mode, where you can set a target and the gimbal will follow you slowly, making video very stable and keeping its eye on the set target!Here is a example of how that works: The video above shows how it slowly compensates for the angle change while keeping the video steady!The Control are very simple but very helpful. You can control the tilt of the Gimbal with the Joystick and at the same time, you can do many other things. Because the gimbal and the phone are connected by Bluetooth, you can start stop recording or zoom in or out. With the help of the mode button, you can change between normal mode, tilt mode, following mode, or lock mode.Here is a quick demo below!: Moving on the battery, it has 12 hours of battery life! This is specially designed for the ""professional"" photographers and the ""vacation"" family!For the professional photographers, you can shoot with ease all day long with absolutely no interruptions!Also, for the vacation family, Leaving the Gimbal accidentally on, or wanting to use it the whole day, shouldn't ruin your days plan if you don't have a charger, so you won't have to ever settle with bouncy video!One potential interruption could be that your phone's battery runs out because recording takes a lot of battery! Don't worry! You can charge your phone on the go with the charging port in the Gimbal! We have spent lots of time and money to create this!Now, please support us in our next step, marketing and getting it out there so everyone can benefit from it!Thank You So Much and we hope to talk with you soon!",AeroKris Tech,"$3,179",Funding SuspendedFunding for this project was suspended by Kickstarter 3 months ago,A New innovative product bringing photographers professionalism at ease.

parents and teachers, we want to help our kids learn, grow and be their best. Sometimes
it feels like we're pushing and negotiating with them through an obstacle
course.Getting
our kids to engage with new technologies, games and apps is effortless. (Yes! You
know what I mean.) When it comes to these technologies, there's no shortage of
great apps and gadgets teaching subjects like math, vocabulary and puzzle
solving. Like most parents and teachers, we are eager to encourage our children’s
other capacities too.Wouldn’t
it be be cool to have a fun educational toy that encouragedreading, imagination, math, singing and fun learning
while playing? We though so! We set out to use our skills in educational
development, software technology, new media and storytelling to make a
captivating product that inspires an appreciation of virtues and their
potential in everyday life in exploring and wanting to learn more.We have already developed and tested our prototype products and app.  With your backing we will complete our work and finalize a set of market ready products.  We will develop four original Kimbi Ed. characters, Rabbit, Owl, Penguin, and Koala Bear",Kimbi,$150,Funding SuspendedFunding for this project was suspended by Kickstarter about 4 years ago,Make learning fun and teaching easy.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/930892225/titan-the-deepest-diving-underwater-drone-for-ever?ref=discovery,1, ,0,"$1,000",Kimbi Educational Robot (Suspended) by Kimbi — Kickstarter
364,"I am raising money to build ""PiTurretBot"" which will be a dagu 6wd robot chassis with my PiTurret on top. The PiTurret and PiTurretBot are completely open source projects and have automatic and manual controls. Help me bring robotics to airsoft! I will be making the website and keep the project open source regardless of whether I reach my goal or not! My project is designed to bring things that i saw in video games into airsoft through robotics. This project is a sentry gun, I also have made an airsoft rc-xd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_vH9bmfGxQ. The next step is to make a robot like the stomper from arma 3. Once i build the robot and have it working properly I am going to be doing another kickstarter with the robot as a reward in order to raise money to build a UAV. I came up with the idea long ago and always wanted to make one but never knew how. After a couple years playing with the raspberry pi doing various projects i thought i could, this past winter was horrible and i was forced to spend a lot of time indoors, so I decided to make the sentry to use this summer when i play airsoft. from there the idea has spread into different projects i want to create for airsoft, all of which will be open source or use open source software.",Matt,$785,Funding SuspendedFunding for this project was suspended by Kickstarter about 3 years ago,"Help me build a 6wd airsoft robot with a turret!

365,"Hello this product is long-awaited and finally it is here. It uses soothing upward directional rollers instead of chemicals which bring back the flow of blood and vitamins to the hair and skin cells in the upper scalp. There is no other device similar until now that can do the same as minoxidil. This device is going to be around for a very long time since it requires no repurchasing of any sort of cheicals. It requires only a little electricity and lasts for a long time and in the next version of this product it will be more refined and it will be smaller and more compact. I am hoping to link it via Bluetooth . I'm looking into the future and there is more features in the next version, I have already designed it and it will be so sleek looking but this version is fully functional so please help me produce the next concealed version designed especially for on the go use. All donations will be remembered post production. Patent Pending, please help with the production funding. I believe this product will help cause world peace.
