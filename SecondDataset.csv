0," Most drones provide a fun way to you capture beautiful outdoor views and while hiking or traveling. But with an underwater drone, anyone can explore the unknown ocean depths! The functionality of a standard, airborne drone expands to meet challenging ocean currents with high performance motion technology.Titan is the most affordable underwater drone on the market with the highest available water pressure rating, built to go wherever your underwater adventure takes you. With its powerful 4K 30fps camera and  streamlined, game-like control system, Titan can be your eyes under the sea. Able to withstand depths up to 150m (492ft), farther than any other drone to date, you can pilot Titan with an easy to use smartphone/tablet app. Capture stunning underwater images and videos, find plentiful locations to fish, or even carry out accurate technical inspections of underwater equipment. The possibilities are endless!Whether you are scuba diver, underwater photographer, drone enthusiast, marine naturalist, educator or just want to have fun, Titan is your best choice.Titan’s built-in camera features a 160° ultra-wide angle lens, creating cinematic 4K videos and spectacular 8MP photos in rich detail and color.Our smartphone app gives you total control while piloting through a live video feed of your underwater drone.Red and purple dive filters provide color correction while capturing footage in water at depths of 5m to 21m (15' to 63'), perfect for fresh or saltwater that appears different color due to algae.Powerful LED lights on each side of the camera illuminate the darkest depths of the ocean.We designed Titan with a diving range of up to 150m, so Titan can dive down and unravel the mysteries of the deep blue sea, while you stay high and dry, and enjoy the adventure.Powered by 6 high performance thrusters and guided by a precise steering algorithm, Titan commands the speed, endurance, and agility needed to withstand demanding deep dives and strong currents.Titan’s underside features an accessory extension port that enables exciting add-ons for different diving purposes.Easily transport Titan in our durable, wear-resistant rolling case.Titan’s included remote controller uses a 2.4GHz frequency to connect with viewing devices, like your smartphone or tablet. It transmits live footage at 1080p, allowing you to watch epic moments unfold in real-time.The GeneRov app is designed specifically to assist you knowing the drone‘s precise path at all times. Polymer lithium batteries power Titan for up to 4 hours while only requiring 2 hours of charging time, more than enough for a single dive.Titan’s eye-catching orange and black design, with symmetrical thrusters for balanced thrusting power, has won a prestigious Red Dot Design Award.All things considered, making anything for underwater use is inherently more challenging than making things to be used on land. But our hardworking team is passionate about creating the best underwater drone that can operate in the open ocean as easily as in the stillest freshwater lake. To that end, we have done hundreds of experiments on Titan prototypes in order to eliminate deficiencies and create the highest performing product we can.We are doing the final round of prototype testing in several freshwater and ocean diving sites to make sure Titan will be ready for consumer use.It started with a question: if a flying drone can hover in the sky, why can’t we make a drone that dives into the sea? Surely an underwater drone could capture footage even more beautiful and mysterious than any airborne drone could manage.We founded Geneinno in 2013 and have been devoted to the drone industry ever since. Over the past 5 years, our research and innovations have earned us numerous patents. And the more time we’ve spent learning about and creating drones, the more we’ve come to love them.Our first underwater drone, Poseidon, was released in 2016 after 8 tests, and its success is due in part to the support of our first followers and fans.Following the valuable insights gained from our experience with the first drone, we now present to you Titan, an easy-to-control drone to capture all your underwater moments.We promise to deliver an extraordinary experience to everyone, and Titan is our best product yet.",Geneinno,"$210,117",Unstated,"With diving range of up to 150m and 4k UHD camera, Titan makes remote underwater exploration fun, easy, and accessible.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,275 ," Could you provide us ""the pins"" of the superior connection?~Dear friends. Would you like to know the measures of the suitcase or sheel coming TITAN, if it fits in the passenger cabin of a regular flight aircraft? This measure will outline my strategy for receiving TITAN. Because in the basement of the planes, the suitcases are very badly treated and sometimes violated. It's very important. As you would ask to deliver the TITAN in the USA and not in BrazilT hank you!~Its not particulary important, but i can imagine that sometimes it would be nice to have a waterproof surfce/controll unit. than i could use a PC built in to a waterproof case with joysticks. But it is probably very nice to use a phone or tablet, because it is very easy to use and bring.~Will it be possible to control from a computer?~In reference to my previous msg, I prefer that it be sent by state mail, not by private courier, for reasons of tax increase. By state post office the taxes are much lower .. Very fought for your helpful attention.~Hi, can you please give more information regarding the extension port at the bottom and the robot arm? How much will the robot arm cost? How do we operate the arm while also controlling the titan? What the spec of the arm?~Boa noite. I would like to know if the shipment to Brazil (Latin America) would be by the United States Postal Service, or other private courier company? Than you.~Hello,May I ask..Is it possible to control during diving with me?~Can any VR goggles be used with the titan? If not where can i get Geneinno VR goggles?~Hi, also just wondering how does the weight work? Does the weight depend on how deep you want to dive?~Hi, just wondering how strong is the cable and the cable connection to the drone? Worst case scenario is if the drone got stuck on some seaweed. Can you use the cable to pull it out?~Could you do a 150m tether update last day or behind August, please?~I have a Poseidon 1 currently and love it.  I have 150m tether for it, question I have is will the it work with the Titan?~Very nice drone!!! seems very stable with 6 thrusters and very cool，just curious about why the shipping cost so high to America~The drone seems very cool but what if i have the early bird package with 150m tether update, can it also be delivered at August？~Please explain the difference between the standard and the premium versions.  Looks like the premium does not come with both filters.  Will it return to the surface automatically in the event of low batteries or a failure?~Footage took in Palau looks great. Does Titan also record audio?  Sounds like there is a diver breathing.~",0.0,"$50,000",Titan - The Deepest Diving Underwater Drone for Everyone by Geneinno — Kickstarter

2,"  Root is the best way to fall in love with coding. It's inspirational.It's fun.It's creative.It takes the BS out of roBotS.Other coding robots are one experience for one age group and toys like these sit on a shelf after a few weeks. Root is the only robot in the world that can be used effectively to teach coding from Kindergarten to College. Learning opportunities with Root will last years, not days.Coding with Root is a dynamic and creative experience: Root reacts to things in the environment, people react to Root and the interplay is orchestrated with code. You can program Root to move, turn, draw, erase, scan colors, play music, light up, sense touches, feel bumps, detect magnetic surfaces, perceive light, and respond to sensors in your phone or tablet.Root’s app supports coders of all ages and backgrounds. The interface may look simple, but it is powerful, allowing you to experiment in real time with loops, events, and complex robot behaviors. We’ve tested the app with kids of all ages (and adults too) to make it the smoothest introduction to programming with robots.As coding skills improve, Root’s multi-level app translates programs written in one level to the next, helping growing programmers take each step.Root's multi-level interface offers learning opportunities to last years, providing a unique continuum of coding experiences. Once all the levels are complete, the transition to any other modern programming language is easy and programming can continue through Root's SDK (software development kit).We are always coming up with activities for using Root, but we are more curious what you will come up with. Here is a fun list to give you some inspiration. Just like a pen and paper, you are only limited by your imagination.  And keep in mind, all of the samples below can be created with Level 1!Root drives on any flat, horizontal surface so it's easy to use paper to quickly create fun coding challenges. With Root, you don't need to spend hours building complex robots from construction kits before getting to the actual coding. Root sets up within seconds. And what's great about paper is that you can save activities to play creations over and over again. Or if you program Root to draw some artwork, it is easy to keep forever and share with family and friends.A whiteboard is a great arena because it’s natural to interact with Root just by drawing and erasing — change a maze or a racetrack layout in seconds — and Root can change its environment right back. For homeschooling and classrooms, whiteboards are already there. Root makes setup and takedown time practically zero, with the robot running on the board at the front of the class where everyone can see. And robots have a unique and universal appeal that engages any aged students.Technology transforms possibilities in every domain, across every field. That makes computing literacy an essential skill for all students, regardless of their future career choices. What’s more, the need for increased diversity in technical roles makes it important to bring authentic coding experiences into all classrooms. Research has shown that early, positive experiences with computing raise students’ interest in technical subjects later on. Root will reach students as early as kindergarten, and grow with them as a familiar and consistent platform as they advance, opening doors that otherwise would have been invisible. Over four years of development and eight iterations of the hardware, we now have the right collection of hardware, sensors, algorithms, and interfaces. We've already tested Root at the Boston Museum of Science, homes, and local classrooms to make sure Root is ready for this Kickstarter. Funds from this campaign will be used towards paying for the production tooling of Root.  Our design is complete and ready to release.Root has been certified by Dragon Innovation, ensuring that we will meet deliverables to our backers. The creators of Root are fortunate to be able to build upon a working relationship with the Dragon team that extends back to our former employment at iRobot.
For now, we're focused on Root and getting it out as fast as possible, but we have a lineup of integrated accessories planned. Accessories will give Root even more capabilities, like a camera for vision programming, physical coding blocks to program away from a screen, a communication module to let multiple Roots talk to each other directly, and even a charger to drive onto. Root is an extensible platform that lets you make and add your own accessories with a 3D printer, Raspberry Pi, Arduino,  BBC Micro:Bit, or camera.
Hardware: Software:Root was born at Harvard University, Wyss Institute.Our team has over 50 years of collective experience in launching and building consumer products (iRobot, Sonos, Apple) and software/education services (Microsoft, Disney, PLTW, Harvard, MIT). This includes launching four coding robots (Create, Kilobot, AERobot, Multiplo), launching two graphical coding environments (MIT App Inventor, Minibloq), and launching three consumer robots (Roomba, Scooba, Looj). This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency

""It's such a cool idea! They should be in every hardware store."" - Sylvia Earle, National Geographic Explorer-In-Residence and TED Prize WinnerAfter four years designing and piloting underwater drones, we've taken everything we've learned and completely re-imagined what an underwater drone could be. Trident has a unique design that combines the versatility and control of an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) and the efficiency of an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle).  It can fly in long, straight survey lines called ""transects"" as well as  perform delicate maneuvers in tight spaces, all while maintaining a sleek and powerful form factor. Trident is easy to use and comes ready to go. Most importantly, it is incredibly fun to fly. (Flying really is the best term, because that's exactly what it feels like when you're piloting.)You may remember us. We came to Kickstarter three years ago and shared our dream of building a low-cost underwater robot that would allow anyone and everyone to explore the world below the surface. We have come a long way since that initial Kickstarter video. We were working out of Eric's garage at the time, building the original prototype to explore a cave in Northern California with rumors of lost treasure (the full story can be heard in this TED talk). We never found the gold, but we received messages from people all over the world who wanted to help us and improve the robot. The Kickstarter project was the springboard. Since then, we've shipped thousands of OpenROV kits to people all over the world. The OpenROV community is the secret sauce. We made our project open source in order to facilitate faster innovation cycles and allow others to improve on our initial designs. Thousands of people have gotten involved. You can see and follow along with the community expeditions on OpenExplorer. We've also assembled a small team that works from our OpenROV HQ in Berkeley, CA to manufacture, ship and support the robots. The combination of community wisdom and the commitment of our internal R&D team (many of whom were original Kickstarter backers) have been the drivers in creating Trident. At OpenROV, we talk openly about our desire to maximize ""Return on Adventure.""  We want to make sure that everyone who comes in contact with our project - community members, customers, employees, whoever - feels that their world is more interesting and more exciting because of it. We want to give people a sense of wonder about how much out there is yet to be explored and make it possible for anyone to be a part of exploring it. Trident is our best attempt yet to fulfill that promise.Every aspect of the Trident design has been painstakingly thought out in order to optimize performance and usability in any situation. One of the secrets of its versatility is the unique, hydrodynamically offset thruster design. This configuration allows you to move through the water fast and efficiently when you want to rapidly search an area or run a transect, but also allows you to maneuver very delicately when in tight quarters or while looking at a particular target.By taking advantage of drag's exponential relationship with velocity, the off-center vertical thruster of the ROV can cause it to pitch at high speeds but also hover or change depth without pitching while operating at low speeds - similar to the way a traditional ROV works. We've designed Trident to be ultra portable and ultra durable. The form factor is small enough to fit in a backpack or fit under an airplane seat. The side panels are overmolded with a strong, rubber coating, which gives it protection from underwater obstacles as well as rough handling when being transported.Depth: Capable of 100m (will ship with a 25m  tether - longer tethers will be sold separately)Mass: 2.9 kgTop Speed: 2 m/sRun Time: 3 hoursThe data connection to Trident is a major evolution from the connection set up of the original OpenROV kit. It uses a neutrally buoyant tether to communicate to a towable buoy on the surface (radio waves don't travel well in water) and the buoy connects to the pilot using a long range WiFi signal. Using a wireless towable buoy greatly increases the practical range of the vehicle while doing transects and search patterns since a physical connection between the vehicle and the pilot doesn't need to be maintained. You can connect to the buoy and control Trident using a tablet or laptop from a boat or from the shore.Our goal is to make the easiest, most intuitive telerobotic control system possible.  We have embraced the latest emerging internet standards from HTML5 and webRTC to WebVR and WebGL to deliver a rich piloting experience through just a browser that runs on laptops, tablets, and modern mobile devices.The software that drives Trident is a living open-source project (https://github.com/openrov/openrov-software). The same software that drives our previous ROV has been continually updated by both the community and our software team.  Some of those changes included: With Trident we are focused on an amazing out-of-the-box experience.  We are reviewing every bit of the user experience regarding our software to ensure the most simple and intuitive experience possible. In each of the reward levels for a Trident, the basic package will include:ADVENTURE SET ADD ON* (add $350 to any pledge level):*You can always get this later if you're not sure. Or only add for either the hard case or longer tether.We built Trident to be the ultimate tool for explorers. But we also wanted to make sure that it was useful for a whole host of utilities. One of the most interesting new features - something that sets Trident in a class of its own - is its ability to conduct long transects, meaning it can run lawn mower patterns over large areas. The benefit of this type of coverage is that you can create visualizations of what the seafloor looks like using photogrammetry software to create a 3D model of the work area. Here's an example from the Fiskardo Greece Expedition run by our friends at OCTOPUS Foundation and Novalta: When overlaid on top of aerial drone footage, these visualizations create a ""window on the sea.""It's also a great tool for boat owners and fishermen. Whether you want to inspect an anchor line or look for shipwrecks, Trident gives you eyes underwater and adds a whole new dynamic to the experience of being on the water. ""The OpenROV project was a winner -- igniting my inner city students' enthusiasm for exploration, taking on academic and technical challenges and developing resilience to over-come set-backs.""-Katie Noonan, Oakland High SchoolOne of the most exciting parts of the OpenROV project has been the number of high school classes and students that have taken part. The project provides an incredibly well-rounded education experience: mechanical and electrical engineering, programming, physics, biology, ecology, contributing to an open source community, and just getting outside into nature. The OpenROV kit (not Trident - the previous model of kit) is still an excellent tool for education (and other uses that require the hack-ability). We have a long list of well-deserving classrooms that can do wonders with a donated OpenROV kit. The reward pledge at the $1,000 level will further our efforts here. It will allow us to send a kit and build materials to one of these schools. If you're a resource-constrained teacher who'd like to be added to this list, please email info@openrov.com with the subject ""I'm a teacher!""We have spent the last two years developing the Trident, engineering dozens of prototypes to get to what you see today.

Still looking forward to getting my trident for this fall, water clarity is usually better in November/December here in the Pacific Northwest.~How is the DVT going?How are you going to organize the delivery of the first Tridents? Are you sending the first batch out and wait for feedback of the users or are you trying to send out as fast as you can and trust in your in-house-tests?~Hopefully Tim Fremark's idea is a viable option.~This is not directed at you Eric but at Kickstarter.It's clearly a double standard with all the ""kickstarter is not a store"" -comments whenever a project fails and no reward is delivered but we're still taxed as if we made a regular purchase.You don't get your money back from your creditcard company's fraud department when a project fails no matter how mismanaged it was as you haven't purchased anything, only supported a project where you may or may not get a gift in return. But if you do get your reward, then it's classified as a purchase and not a gift and you're taxed accordingly.~Looks like I'll have to pay around 430 USD just for customs (no fees included) depending on how a ROV is classified (it's not in the list of items). It's either a boat, a webcam or a computer.I'm hoping it's a computer as that seems to be the cheapest of the three :-)It would actually be cheaper for me to fly from Stockholm-Sweden to LAX pick it up there, fly back and carry it through customs myself. Kind of sucks.~You cant ship to a warehouse in Europe and distribute from there to the European pledges?~As we (hopefully) get closer to the shipping date I was wondering... How about Customs and fees?I've backed other kickstarter projects where custom fees have been somehow included in the shipping. I couldn't find any info on the campaign page just now so I'm wondering... Will I have to pay a hefty fee to get my Trident or is this avoidable? If not, is there any way to calculate how much (ballpark figure)?~Hi Eric!Looking for some news... Are the T3 shells performing as expected? Have you reached the end of DVT yet?~Good news again.  While I'm likely as eager to receive my Trident as anyone, the last thing I or anyone needs is problems due to quality and having to return it for rework or replacement.  A product for this environment just has to go through these processes, wish there was but there's really no other option.~Hey EricIt's been 3½ years since we met in Norway at the makerfaire there. A couple of openrov's later and now the Trident. I can't wait. I know I have to, but darn.. It's tough. ;)Peter~Hope all is going well.  Based on your last update I'm very much looking forward to where you are.  Provided nothing major happened I imagine you're right on the cusp of everything coming together.  My claw design is progressing nicely - 3d printer arrives next week so I'm hoping to start producing some prototypes.~How are things going, Eric? Any news you can share with us?~Any updates coming up soon?  How is the DVT stage going?  Any big changes or pivots?~I'm still curious about the comment ""a few new features that we have been waiting to tell you all about"" that you posted on march 22'nd.Might there be a small nugget to tidy us over until the next update?~Thank you for the recurring updates.~",0.0,"$50,000",OpenROV Trident - An Underwater Drone for Everyone by OpenROV — Kickstarter
4," Archeologists suggest that cats were first domesticated by farmers to hunt the little critters that ruined their crops. Keeping cats as pets indoors is only a recent trend. As such, domestic cats have maintained their natural hunting instincts but lack a proper outlet to express them. In the wild, cats hunt up to 20 times a day. While being kept indoors is very beneficial to cat health and safety in a number of ways, not being able to express their natural hunting instincts has been shown to contribute to a number of negative behavioral habits.With his ability to sense and react to your cat, Mousr is the only toy capable of truly reproducing the hunting experience for indoor cats.Without a doubt, Mousr is the most technologically advanced cat toy ever to exist. We’ve been called crazy, and maybe we are, but personally we think cats are worth it. After all, cats are people, too.We really wanted Mousr to be as small and fast as possible, but we also wanted him to have personality. We have been working with several designers and engineers with a lot of experience in order to ensure Mousr’s industrial design will be able to handle all our physical and technological requirements while remaining sleek and cute. Over the last 4 months we have been rapidly iterating on the hardware design in Shenzhen, China. Being in China allowed us to evaluate a dozen different possible solutions faster than we could have anywhere else. We also worked with many talented people to help us push Mousr's technology to its limits. We believe we have the best possible platform that will enable Mousr to do all the cool things we envision for him. Now we have to finalize the hardware design and source the exact components that will be used in the final production version. You know, stuff like “should we use this LED or this LED?”The look and feel of Mousr is nearly complete. Issues such as how to attach the tail and where to mount the sensors have been worked out. As Mousr's hardware design iterates into its final form, we will continue to tweak his appearance until it's just right.The tail accesories are a work in progress (you can help - see the rewards!). Our goal thus far was to build custom tails that our cats love to chase. We would love to hear your input on what materials your cat loves best and how they can be incorporated into Mousr's tail.We’ve spent the majority of our time in China learning about the stuff we didn’t know (i.e. rapid prototyping and design). Now we’re ready to move on to the stuff we know best - algorithm development. So far we’ve worked with sensor data to ensure we can detect things like nearby motion or external forces on Mousr (e.g. a cat’s paw). On an early prototype with commercial IR sensors, we were able to successfully get Mousr to react to, dodge, and entice our cats to play. With the addition of our 360 degree vision system, we opened the door to making Mousr a full-on artificially intelligent mouse.To give Mousr the kind of intelligence he needs to be able to outsmart a cat requires in-depth knowledge of signal processing and artificial intelligence. The nuances of his intelligence using his unique vision system haven't been implemented yet, but our team’s 14 years of combined graduate level experience in digital signal processing, non-stationary signal analysis, adaptive filters, biologically inspired signal processing, low-power systems, and 3D audio localization make us the best team for giving Mousr the intelligence he needs to truly challenge your cat.We have a version of the app that is able to remote control Mousr, and we have discovered some interesting control methods that work well to engage cats. We will continue to discover what kinds of movements work effectively with cats in order to improve the app's functionality. The app's graphical design hasn't been developed yet.Mousr is being developed by a Ph.D. and two Ph.D. candidates from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Electrical Engineering who all own cats. We've been building cat toys and cat furniture for years in an effort to understand our furry friends better.In particular, we became obsessed over figuring out what games and toys cats loved to play with. After observing how excited cats would get playing with us, and how bored they were with their automatic toys, we decided to build a better solution. As engineers, the solution was clear - robots.Find Noel's other great design work at http://designhub.ie Duncan is the new managing director at HAXLR8R, and he is amazingContact Rong for your design needs at rou819 [at] hotmail [dot] comGo watch Steve's other videos at https://www.youtube.com/user/supersteeb1Check out Amanda's awesome lamp, Clyde, at www.fabule.comDon’t assume any meaning to the order here.

5," During the past year we've been working hard to make and test prototypes of a product we truly believe in. Quirkbot is a toy that allows you to create and program your own robots and make your own toys.So far, we've managed to create the prototypes with no external funding and pre-orders from only one customer; a Swedish science center.Now we need your help to bring Quirkbot to the world. If we can raise $55,000 from you, the Kickstarter community, this will make it possible to start production of the Quirkbots and finish the first release of the free software. We believe that the most powerful way to learn is to have fun and that the world of programming, electronics and mechanics belongs to everyone. We want Quirkbot to be accessible to beginner tinkerers, educators, artists, inventors, engineers and anyone else. Please support us and be a part of the change!
Quirkbot is a microcontroller toy that anyone can program. It is compatible with the open construction toy Strawbees and can be used along with readily available materials like regular drinking straws, LEDs, and hobby servos (motors) to create a wide variety of hackable toys suitable for anyone aged 10+.Bring your creations to life. You can program the Quirkbot via USB directly from our website. Just drag and drop the components you want to program, connect them and press upload. Any child or grown-up can do it. Let your creations express themselves and interact with their environment through sound, light and motion. Stand alone or connected to computers, tablets or musical instruments. You'll quickly see the potential in learning how to program something physical -- the magic of connecting online and offline worlds.Quirkbot is a creation for kids, created with kids. We tested our Quirkbots at Kids Hack Day events all over the world, collecting input from kids regarding usability, and what they want to get out of such a product. We have seen first-hand what happens when you give kids tools to become creators of technology, not just consumers.The Quirkbot team is working together with Strawbees to open up a whole new world of robotic creatures. With Quirkbot you can build quirky robots, blinking outfits and weird sounding creatures using regular drinking straws and a little bit of imagination. Below is a very small selection of things that are easy to build with the Quirkbot.Working closely with kids, we designed an easy-to-use visual programming interface that runs directly in your browser. You can create, modify, and share projects with your friends anytime. Add components with squeeze on electronicsWe have developed a unique feature that allows you to add LEDs and sensors to the Quirkbot. We call this ""squeeze on electronics”. You can just squeeze your components onto the legs of the Quirkbot using regular drinking straws. It's easy and allows for anyone to build an interactive project without soldering.
Control it with light
If you squeeze a light sensor onto one of the legs, it can detect small changes in the surrounding light. This also makes it possible to have a direct analog input control for the Quirkbot. Add a straw that has a light source in the other end (like a simple LED flashlight that can be built from Strawbees and a clock battery) and just pinch it to change how much light the sensor sees. It’s a really fun and intuitive way to control the Quirkbot.Add backpacks for extended functionalityOur backpack extensions are an easy way to add extra functions to the Quirkbot. In the pledges we already have backpacks for motors, distance sensor, speaker and MIDI. In addition we have a lot of prototypes and even more ideas for new backpacks in the pipeline. It will allow you to add cool new functions and possibilities for play. For example phone control, vibration, microphone, movement sensor, new types of motors and much more.Two ways to touchThe Quirkbot has two ways of doing touch sensing already built-in to make almost anything into an interface. Loop touching for bigger things with water in them like humans and other fruits and capacitive sensing for metallic things.
Use the Quirkbot to talk to any deviceWhen plugged to a computer, the Quirkbot can work like a keyboard or mouse input. This makes it very easy to program the Quirkbot into a controller for any game or application.The Quirkbot can also act as a MIDI-device, so it can play with music programs and you can even use it with an iPad.The story of Kids Hack DayIt's early spring in Stockholm. The date is April 11th, 2013. Lead Instigator of the soon-to-be Kids Hack Day Movement, Carl Bärstad, is participating in the event Art Hack Day. Carl still just considers himself a ""wannabe maker"" and Art Hack Day terrifies him. He sees himself neither as a hacker nor an artist. However, what happens over the coming 2 days is anything but terrifying. The creative energy at Art Hack Day is overwhelming and a powerful idea is planted in Carl and the people he talks to: If only there was an event like this but for kids. 1 week later a team is formed (including Erik from Strawbees), a venue found and a date set for the worlds first Kids Hack Day event in Stockholm august 30th 2013. A Global Movement is bornBuilding on top of the networks of the founding members of Kids Hack Day, such as TEDx (read story here) and Hyper Island, in just the first year the team manages to initiate over 12 events, on 5 different continents and in 12 different cities, with no external funding. The story of Quirkbot In early february 2014, the team realizes that for Kids Hack Day to grow into a sustainable organization something has to be done regarding its ""non-existent"" business model. Something had been unleashed that was simply way too important to remain a creative side-project. But because there was a consensus not to charge for the events there was no other way for Kids Hack Day but to create its own product. After all, the community had already called for a more fun, simple and easy tool that could combine programming and electronics with the genius simplicity of the Strawbees building system.So in early february 2014 Gothenburg-based prototyping company Ideofon, and Erik from Strawbees was contacted. 16 days later, after the first ideation meeting, a set of prototypes for Quirkbots had been created and the project had materialized. Since our first ideation meeting on March 12th, 2014, we've been prototyping the Quirkbot and using these early prototypes at Kids Hack Day events in Stockholm, Amsterdam, Moscow and Valencia. We are now almost ready for production after 13 prototyping iterations including redesign of the circuit, changing the shape of the PCB to give it more creature-like features, as well as coming up with new functions and adding backpacks.Open Source Software and Open Source HardwareThe Quirkbot Arduino library will be licensed under an open source software license and the physical board under a creative commons and open source hardware license*.

6," What is it?Bartendro is a precision cocktail dispensing robot! It makes tasty drinks quickly and repeatably without the mess. It's light and portable so that you can easily take it to events, conferences, weddings, parties, or wherever!It's easy for one bot to serve more than 200 drinks in an evening.  A tasty cocktail is less than 10 seconds away.Check out the drink menu in advance on your smartphone.Bartendro is easy to set up and cleans up in about 5 minutes. Liquids only pass through food-grade tubing, not moving parts! Fill up a pitcher with warm soapy water and turn on the cleaning cycle. Run another cycle with clean water and sanitizer and the bot is good as new.The user interface is intuitive and can be customized for the different types of events you host.Special admin screens let you manage dispensers, ingredients and drink recipes. This is where calibration, customization and cleaning take place.You can also view reports of the drinks made and quantities of ingredients used.Check out one of our latest blog posts to get an idea of Bartendro's drink making capabilities.Why did we make it?Have you ever made or had a cocktail that was really perfect but was elusive to recreate? Have you ever wanted to know more about cocktails without drinking a lot to acquire the knowledge? We did. We wanted a machine that could pour complex cocktails in any size, including small tasters, that are proportionally accurate.We were also fed up with precision dispensing technology being prohibitively expensive and wanted a more affordable solution that we and others could start using to make fun and interesting things.We wanted to build a community where users could create, rate and share new drinks from around the world. How does it work?We use peristaltic pumps which dispense a known volume with every revolution of the motor to precisely meter our drinks.Each pump combined with our custom electronics is called a ""dispenser."" The dispenser boards use the same processor as an Arduino and connect through a RJ-45 connector to a ""router board"" which carries the Raspberry Pi (RPI) computer. Any normal networking cable will work, but we've custom made the cables that come with Bartendro to be just the right length. Router boards can handle up to 15 dispensers, while miniRouter boards can handle up to 3 dispensers. The RPI sets up a wireless access point and creates a WiFi network called Bartendro.To get started, simply connect to this network from any device and go to a web browser. Regardless of the web address you type, you'll be directed to Bartendro's main drink menu screen.What can you do with it?Every time we set Bartendro up, we get a flurry of ideas suggested to us. Can it accept credit cards? Can you make it detect if someone is intoxicated? What about RFID or facial recognition. These are all possibilities we'd love to see implemented, but our resources are limited. That's why the software and the hardware are open source. Add a Microsoft Kinect to the top of the bot, or a card reader for payment or age verification, a breathalyzer, social networking or drink suggestions. Integrate stirring/shaking, an ice dispenser or a conveyor belt to move several glasses through the bot. You can even put the whole thing on wheels and make it a mobile robot! The ideas are almost endless and this is a great platform to build on. Check out our source code on Github.Ideas we've received for pump uses:These pumps are not to be used for medical applications, but they're good for just about everything else. Different types of tubing must be used for heavier solvents, or bio-diesels. Send us a note if you want more info.What you get!Stickers, t-shirts and glassware will just contain our logo unless you, our backers, vote on having something more fun like, ""I love bots that get me drunk!""Bartendro 3 Starter Kit (not pictured): comes with 3 dispensers, and one miniRouter board and a power supply. Supply your own Raspberry Pi and build your own frame. Warning: Does not come ready to use!Disclaimers:The current design doesn't handle carbonated liquids well, but we see this as a solvable problem that we'll tackle in the near future. The quality of drinks depends on what you put in the bot. Garbage in equals garbage out. We like quality drinks, so we make simple syrup and squeeze fresh limes and lemons for every event. We think it's totally worth it.What you see in the pictures may be slightly different than what you get. We may have to make optimizations to build much larger quantities. The final colors of the enclosure are not finalized. The black frame will remain black, but the sheet metal parts will likely be a light metallic silver.Bartendro is not fully sealed; the electronics are intentionally visible because we think they're cool to look at. The drink-pouring action doesn't happen near the electronics, but you will still need to be careful to not get liquids on them! We know first hand how easy it is to get carried away when a drink can be made at the press of a button. Please drink responsibly and always have a designated driver.Please Support Us!We've worked very hard to get the cost as low as possible without sacrificing quality and commercial level functionality. We've also sacrificed our livers to make sure the quality of drinks in our database is excellent.We need to place several large minimum-quantity orders and purchase expensive pieces of tooling to keep this project going.

Looking forward for a great product~Oops, I realize you don't want to serve beer... Sorry.~David: use an empty beer keg to install the pumps, and put this on another keg/table. This way you can replace your ""drink source"" easily.Just an idea, don't  what exactly you want..~I like that idea Christopher.  I see no reason why the tubes could not go through a hole in the fridge.  You just want to use a seal that can be removed so you can replace the tubes easily if need be.  The case I'm make (at least in this stage of development) is a beer keg.  I'm going to mount the pumps into holes I'm drilling in the sides of the keg.  The bottles will be placed around the edge of the keg.  The problem I'm trying to figure out now is can I run the output tubes up the center of the keg, through a tap handle and out.  Just not sure if the pump will work uphill as well as it works down.~Guys.  A couple of questions.  Do you know, or have you tried, to mount the pumps upside down?  Does it work?  or, can the end of the output tubes be located above the pump?~Here's the application idea - a Bartendro 7 kit in a nice cabinet. In the cabinet is a mini-fridge to hold 7 bottles of fruit juice, syrup and other flavorings suitable for the kids to make their own flavoring recipes to add to a bottle of SodaStream carbonated water. The syrups need to be refrigerated, of course... so any reason the feed tubes can't be passed through drilled and insulated holes into the fridge? No reason the liquid can't be chilled down to 40F before being pumped?~The best combination I've come up with so far for a Bartendro 3 is vodka, orange juice and coffee liqueur. Makes a screwdriver or black russian. With adjusted proportions on the screwdriver and manually adding club soda you have the gilbert, and adjusted proportions on the black russian and manually adding milk you have a white russian.~Congrats on $125K! Less than $10K to go!! I've been doing what I can to help spread the word :)~Wow, having a great couple of days and it looks like you are picking up steam.  How good do you feel about the delivery dates?  Do you plan to start production prior to the end if you pass your funding threshold?~What is the smallest amount of liquid that can be delivered?  e.g. Will Bartendro be able to make a Manhattan with a dash of angostura bitters?~Congrats on passing the $100k mark!~The T-shirt should read:~Would love to have a way to export data as to how many of each type of drink were dispensed at each event.~Found this great site that others might get inspiration from for drink creations:  http://12bottlebar.com/~Greetings from Team COSMOBOT!  Our four year reign of making cosmic cocktails for BarBot and other events has been put on hold because of persistent leaks! We are excited to learn about open source drinkbots and would like to support fellow drinkbot makers! Best of luck!~You guys rock.  Is there more we can do to promote this so you get funded?  I saw that Wired featured you.  Are their other blogs that we can submit to on your behalf?~Just to update this page.  I got a replay that there isn't any cross contamination because there is no mixing done at the machine.~Are there issues with flavor contaimnation from the previous drinks? For example if you pour a shot of something green will your next shot of vodka have a little green coloring in it?~Carbonation will always be a non-starter in a parastaltic system because it will tend to push liquid away from the pump on both sides. A carbonation feature could be added by having all the tubes Y into a soda fountain dispenser nozzle. McDonalds and CocaCola (at least) already have electronically controlled soda fountains. The CocaCola ones probably even have a system like bartendro on the inside of their Freestyle machines.~How about giving us a place where we can add drinks to a dbase now so that we can start working together as a community to compile the most kick-ass recipes ever.~I backed the shotbot but I certainly hope that you make the router 15 boards available regardless if you fund or not. Would love to do a DIY version of this sometime in the future!~I didn't see any notes about the lights on the pumps.  Are they programmable or random?~What are the dimensions of a Bartendro 7?  I'm trying to figure if it will fit into a case I have.  LOVE this.~What makes this system better than any of the other drink dispensing/mixing systems on the market?~Hey guys, are we going to be able to drive multiple minirouters from one raspberry pi?~What tablet are you using and how much would it cost to add on a mount?~I was watching Doctor Who before I pledged, so maybe that's why I want a t-shirt with that cute logo and the word ""Intoxicate!"" :)~I've seen these at parties and they're completely amazing and fun. If it's shipping from SLO and they're ready by then, I'll pick mine up on PolyCon weekend to save you shipping.~I, for one, welcome our new drink-dispensing robot overlords!~TekSpree.com is proud to support this innovative bartending solution! It certainly would be handy for our staff meetings on Monday's... we tend to need a little pickmeup after the weekend :)  I love the crepe idea too - mostly because, well, I love crepe and I can NEVER get the portion size quite right.  And seriously.. how cool would it be to have an office crepe machine?!

We'll be taking pre-orders soon, and you'll be able to get your own Ringo shipped about the same time as the Kickstarter backers.We are so grateful for the awesome people who showed up BIG TIME to help fund the Ringo project. We can't wait to share our future plans with you all. You guys are part of the family now and we'll always appreciate you!We need your help!Will you do two things to continue to spread the word now that the Kickstarter is complete?Ringo is a super cute pet robot bug based on the Arduino UNO
and packed with goodies including an accelerometer, gyroscope, 6 awesome RGB
LEDs (NeoPixel lights), music chirper, and more.  Everything you need to bring to life a real
personality in a digital pet of your own.The robot was inspired and co-designed by my 1st grade daughter Hailey and my 3rd grade son Parker, who are both already writing C code.  (Check the longer ""back story"" below!)  Ringo grew out of a project intended to build just one robot for my kids but we realized something much greater could be done in producing Ringo for the masses.  We hope it will catch the curiosity of young engineers and also have a particular appeal to girls who may not otherwise become interested in coding and technology.""They see something that looks complicated, and they now look at it with curiosity rather than intimidation.""We have always been interested in the idea of the “digital
pet”, and for that matter, any kind of machine or robot that exhibits a
personality.  That was the real driving
force behind the design of Ringo.  We
wanted to put some really useful parts on a circuit board that is very easy to
program, then see what people do with it. 
We’ve already written code to do much of the heavy lifting for you, and
we’ve also written a pile code examples to get you started.Ringo is suitable for anyone just getting started in
programming and robotics all the way up to highly experienced users who may
come up with more advanced behaviors.  As
the Plum Geek website goes live shortly before shipping Ringo to backers, we
plan to focus on education and provide lots of written and video examples of
how to write code for the robot.  We’ll
start with simple examples like how to make the motors go and how to make the
lights pretty colors. Then we’ll build on these concepts to more complex
behaviors.  Beginner lessons will show
the very basics setting up the Arduino software on your computer and of writing
simple code.One cool aspect of a robot like Ringo is that he can
exhibit millions of possible behaviors, but because the hardware is the same
between units, all code written for Ringo can be directly shared with anyone
else.  The shared code can be uploaded to
another Ringo and it will behave in exactly the same way. Once the website goes
live we will begin to feature lists of behaviors submitted by the user
community.  Others will be able to
quickly load this example code on their own Ringo for quick entertainment, as
well as having the opportunity to learn from the code from others and even
customize or expand on it.  This is truly
the greatest aspect of an open source project! Design files, schematics, and source materials will be
released when Ringo ships to backers. 
This is a fully open source project.Ringo was inspired by some of the BEAM robots, particularly
the Photopopper Photovore from solarbotics.com.  We
have built robots from an Arduino in the past by connecting an assortment of
various shields and break-out boards that have similar functionality to Ringo,
but they weren’t as cute.  We thought it
was reasonable that we could squeeze all the important bits from our
“collection of boards” robots down into something the size of a BEAM type
robot.  (Google “Beam Robot” and prepare to be amazed!) 
And so, Ringo was born.So what about these goodies? Here’s a quick run down.Based on Arduino UNO:  Ringo uses the same microprocessor as the Arduino UNO, and runs at 8 MHz which is adequate for the functions Ringo will be expected to perform.  You’ll use the Arduino IDE coding environment to write code for Ringo.  He is fully compatible with all the functions and libraries available for the UNO board.  We have also written some custom libraries and functions which do the heavy lifting when it comes to dealing with the accelerometer, gyro, and the math associated with calculating movements.3-Axis Accelerometer:   Can be used to sense movement in all 3 axis.  Can also be used to determine the orientation of the robot as well tap detection.  So you can trigger behaviors when the robot is moved or swatted by your cat.   This sensor can be used as a basis to make Ringo travel specific distances, or when moved by an outside force to return to his starting position, etc.  The part is a Freescale MMA8451QR1.3-Axis Gyroscope:  Can be used to determine which direction Ringo is facing.  It works in all 3 axis, though the flat axis will be most useful as you can determine how far he has turned, or to cause him to turn a specific number of degrees.  The part is an ST L3GD20TR.Six RGB LEDs:  Each of these LEDs can create a mix of red, green, and blue which basically allows you to create any color you want by mixing the three values.  These are the same lights used in NeoPixel products from Adafruit Industries. (Thanks Limor!!!)  The code to control the lights is super simple to use and the lights enable all kinds of expression.  Two lights on the top, two on the bottom, and both eyes light up. Bling!Sound Element:  The piezo sound element can create any sort of pings, tones, and chrips you can think of.  Can be used to give Ringo a voice as he explores his environment.  Can also be used to play musical notes.Light Sensors:    Three sensors can measure ambient light 360 degrees around Ringo, allowing him to respond to light, shadows, etc.Infrared Light Sources:  Three IR light sources are placed pointed 120 degrees apart.  They can be enabled individually in any pattern and can be driven together at the same time.  This allows creating signals like those from a TV remote to communicate with other Ringo bots or control appliances like your TV.  They can also be used together with the Light Sensors to detect objects or movement near Ringo.38 kHz Receiver:  This is a special sensor designed to sense the modulated light signal produced by most TV remote controls.  Use the included remote or teach your Ringo to respond to your own remote.  Imagine if each time you change a channel on your TV that Ringo dances around your coffee table. Cool!Edge Sensors:  A light sensor and an IR light source are hidden under both of Ringo’s feelers.  This allows him to sense edges and follow lines.  We’ve had success creating mazes with lines or tape on a desk.  What other uses can you come up with?Charging:  Ringo charges his battery automatically whenever plugged into the programming adaptor, or when a USB cable is connected directly to his USB port.  (Note the USB port on Ringo does not provide any data communication, it is simply used as charging input).  A “charging status” LED is provided so you can see when he has completed charging.Pager Motors:  The tips of the motors contact the running surface, allowing Ringo to skate around your table.  Both motors can be controlled independently.  They can run forward or backward at variable speed.Programming Adaptor:  The programming adaptor is a go-between for your computer and Ringo.With your support in bringing Ringo to the masses, we will be able to purchase parts in larger quantities.  We will also use funds to purchase tooling to stamp the metal motor mount and the connectors for Ringo's eyes.  Buying large quantities of these parts up front significantly lowers costs going forward and will help Plum Geek get off the ground to bring you more robot designs in the future.Of course you can also help us get the word out!  By sharing our project on Facebook and Twitter, That's really the greatest thing you could do to help with this and future projects, and we are forever grateful for your assistance in sharing the word.  The prototype Ringo units use a simple brass bar as a motor mount. The motors were attached with 3M VHB tape. The production Ringo units that will be shipped to backers will have a proper and more substantial motor mount. The mount will be made of nickel plated spring steel which will be soldered into locating holes on the circuit board. The production mount will firmly hold the pager motors.As a stretch-goal, if we are able to raise $15,000 in pledges, we will upgrade the battery in all Ringo robots to a 250 mAh or 300 mAh Lithium Polymer (LiPo) cell resulting in longer run time.One day as Parker was about to start the 2nd grade, I wired up an RGB LED to an Arduino board and showed him how he could control the color and blink timing by writing simple instructions. I’ll never forget seeing his eyes the moment it dawned on him that he could actually control this thing.  He pushed me aside from the keyboard and spent the next two hours writing color sequences. I explained that the brain inside our robots worked the same way, and that it’s just as easy to control motors and read light sensors. My daughter Hailey heard this and got involved.  She saw how easy it was for Parker to control lights and she wanted to know how to program a robot. She was still in kindergarten, but she had no problem understanding the logic of what the simple programs were doing. My wife and I were amazed at how quickly they were able to pick up the basics, and we knew we needed to go further with this. I suggested to the kids that we could design our own custom robot from the circuit board up and Hailey was super excited about the idea.  I told her if she could help me come up with a good design, that I would have some boards made and I would build one for her. I thought it would be fun to involve her in the creative process.I'd made her a BEAM robot the year before from a solarbotics.com kit and she had played with it like it was a pet.  It suddenly occurred to me that if we were to add a processor and some  sensors while keeping the cute ""pet"" feel, that kids and especially girls would be driven to learn some basic programming as a means of giving it a personality.I realized we may be onto something that could really help encourage people to take the first steps in learning technology and that this needed to be bigger than just making one robot for my daughter.  If we were to create robots with a cost within reach of the average family, and then to create a free educational video series along with them it would be very powerful in showing people of all ages that they really can learn to code, to develop, and to make. This would also be a great way to give back to the open community that got me started in electronics in the first place. 
So a year ago we got serious, and today we're off to take the next big step.  Thank you for your support, and we would be forever grateful if you would share our project with your friends and other educators on your social media.  Two quick clicks of the Twitter and Facebook icons would go so far.  :-)We think robotics are particularly valuable to pique the curiosity of young developers.  Being able to control the behavior of this “living” machine has fascinated both of our kids.  They have learned to write simple code not because of an interest in programming itself, but rather because it allows them to make the robot do something new.  Robotics put users in close contact with the hardware which naturally inspires questions about the basic building blocks and the circuitry itself.  This encourages them to understand it is realistic for them to have ideas, then put together the basic components to build their ideas, and finally to write the software to give life to their ideas.

love robots, but they can be a really expensive hobby, especially legged robots. When I tried to build a hexapod in college, everything I found was typically $1,000-$2,000. Current kits are expensive and tough to use, and meant for people that are already into robotics. The designs for them are closed, and rarely if ever updated. When I started development of Hexy roughly a year ago, I was using 10 year-old software and electronics, because that's what was available, and it showed. Why not make a hexapod kit that makes complex robotics cheaper, easier to learn, radically more fun (and cute!) and based on completely open hardware and software?Cheap robots for everyone! The idea behind ArcBotics is to become the Ikea of robotics. Provide functional, minimalistic robots with step-by-step instruction that anyone can make, lowering cost as much as possible in the process. Hexy is the first robot a line of many that aims to enable low-cost, easy access to easily modifiable and expandable robots, for everyone from the learning student to the high-end researcher.Hexy the Hexapod is a cute-as-buttons fun little six-legged robot buddy, and is the first ArcBotics Open Robotics kit. Hexy is:It Comes With: Use it to learn advanced robotics concepts like inverse kinematics, or use pre-built code to have it march to your bidding. Build it using the high-quality video and picture filled tutorials, and its ready to walk, play and dance with
pre-built demos. The Servitor32 robot controller is fully Arduino-based open hardware, capable of controlling up to 32 servos and/or any sensor you can plug into an Arduino, programmable using Arduino code. Hook it to your PC or Mac via USB or have it run autonomously. . Use the controller and servos in other robot projects. Do what you want, all the code, and plans and cut files are yours.  As part of building ArcBotics to drive forward low-cost Open Robotics, I've invested around $20k into purchasing a laser cutter and rapidly iterating the design of the hexapod over the better part of a year, and its finally in a state close to releasable. The low cost I want, however, is only achievable with sufficient volume to order. All the factory sourcing is lined up and tested, the production model is highly scalable, and I just need the funds finish final prototyping, order large part quantities and then start flooding the world with cheap adorable robots.Even if this fails, I'll still release all the files online. However, the kits are far more expensive to build without large sourcing and my manufacture techniques, and you won't get them nearly this cheap.The goal of the company isn't to make large profits, its to advance Open Robotics through easily available cheap robots, a cause near and dear to my heart. If this works out, I'll launch even more Open Robotics kits.

Thanks ArcBotics.~...is there a plan I place to ship me my Hexy in the near future?~HELP!~Can we get an update on the shipping progress? It has been almost six weeks since your last update when you said that you would have all the kits shipped by the end of December.~My one also arrived today (Austria). Now i drive home to see whats in the box ;)~Mine just arrived in Austria :) Looking forward to building it!The box is much smaller than I anticipated. It's really tightly packed in there.~Well I got the bluetooth module, now I just need the rest of the robot.  :)~@ArcBotics~@adderHave you tried changing the power source, ie. external power adapter?Maybe the bateray not powerful enough. Just a thought.~@ArcBotics: You were right, they stopped shaking. Unfortunately it can't get up on its own (bad back-left leg(s?)?). If I hold it up the ""Get Up"" command gets executed but then ""Move Forward"" just makes it curl up (Servotor FW 1.7, PoCoMo 1.0, 4 charged NiMH http://goo.gl/JmIHw & USB). I updated the gallery in my previous post with movies. I'd really appreciate some help here as I'm close to giving up...~@ArcBotics I've had some trouble with non-fitting parts (https://picasaweb.google.com/101974050495289748767/HexyNonFittingParts)  but some filing fixed that. Now though I have 3 servos that shake continuously when centered. Is there something that can be done about this?~@Arcbotics: ah, okay thanks. Looking forward to getting it soon. :)~Did you upload the Bluetooth tutorial? I did not see this anywhere. Please assist. Thanks.~@ArcBotics don't worry about it, I was just a bit ... surprised earlier, I guess red is nice enough (and shipping would take too long). I'll let you know how the assembly goes.~I never got my bluetooth hexy. What's the deal? It seems like everyone has one now...~I just got my tag-team package. Unfortunately instead of a blue and a gray I got a blue and a red. I can't believe that after all the waiting I got a wrong one!~@ArcBoticsMine must not have been PRE-programed???~What does it mean preprogrammed? I can't seem to get my Bluetooth module to work (does not appear as a com port under Win7). I can pair but that's about it.~@Chris Wundramyou can find one @ ebay 271040855319~Whats the current quantity that has shipped so far?~Any idea on when we can expect shipment?  Also, apparently I pledged for the non bluetooth kit.  Can I order the bluetooth module separately from anywhere?~Hi, I am also trying to get Bluetooth to work on Win7. Actually I can pair but I am not seeing a com port. When connected via USB I am good to go on Com4. The shaking and curl-up issues should disappear when you include the recommended batteries (2700mAh Powerex). Other batteries just don't have enough power.~@ArcBotics  How about some FAQ's???  info on batteries, like how long they should last, etc. what about the ultrasonics? bluetooth? what about why some servos shake? why after new batteries and a few moves it just curl-up, what does that mean?  there should be more DOC's on hexy after 6 months.~is there anyone using win7 have bluetooth working on there hexy? i have tried what all the post said and still can't get bluetooth to talk. i have 2 com ports and bluetooth paired, tried putty but won't talk to the com ports.~hi there - im still waiting for a mail that my hexy is on the waythe package should be here in europe by now and im moving in a few days and dont know if my mail-re-routing will work :/~I realize the nature of comments left at this point in the project are likely to be requests for help or reports of problems.  However, I'd like to hear about any successes that people are having.  Thanks.~Joseph, thanks for the consideration, but taking a typical example from the instructions at http://makeprojects.com/Project/Building+an+ArcBotics+Hexy/2661/2, step 12 image 1, the side pieces vary by up 2mm in length (longest vs. shortest) and almost 1mm in width and/or depth; so to keep the servo axle centred means a lot of faffing around with grinding one and/or the other end.~CUTTING LOSSES - HEXY VERY CHEAP IN LONDON~I received our purple Hexy just in time to get it under the tree.~i have a major problem with all the leg's stepper that mounts to the body is off center, and the leg hits the body on all 6 legs. the plastic piece in step# 12  hip piece with a circle and rectangle that the stepper fits tight in it, is off center.  there is no way to adjust it, other than cutting new Blue plastic parts with the correct center. You can see all the legs are twisted and not straight.~One more thing, when attaching the wires (step 28) are the brown wires always supposed to be closest to the controller edge? In other words they are inserted in one direction for pins 5 to 15 and the opposite direction for pins 16 to 26, always maintaining the brown wire closest to the edge. Please confirm.~Hi, I just finished putting together the HEXY and found 7 bad servos. Not sure of the remaining servos will go bad or not, but 7 are not functioning. Also where do I connect the Bluetooth board (not in the instructions)? Please reply. Thanks.~Got my Hexy today, haven't opened it though.Merry Christmas and I hope you do well moving the business forward in the new year; I may be interested in additional servotor 32's depending on how much I like it and the documentation.~Thought I would offer a cool trick I stumbled on to get all the protective paper off the laser cut plastic.  A plastic disposable knife, like the kind you get from drive through etc.  The little teeth on the knife grabs the edge of the paper and is a softer plastic than the Hexy parts so it does not scratch even if you choose to drag it across the part to create an edge.~",0.0,"$13,000",Hexy the Hexapod - Low-Cost Six-Legged Open Robot by ArcBotics — Kickstarter
10," ==============================================================Once this Kickstarter has ended, visit http://mirobot.io for the latest Mirobot news==============================================================I need your help to get Mirobot into the hands of as many children as possible. These might be your own children, students that you teach or the children of a friend. Your feedback will be used to make the whole system more robust and reliable and will help me understand which problems to solve to increase adoption. Mirobot is a small, WiFi robotics kit that children can build themselves and then use to learn about technology, engineering and programming. It's fun to build and easy to start programming it to draw shapes. The chassis is laser cut and snaps together quite easily. It's evolved over quite a few iterations now and I'm confident that it works. it's robust, but also quite simple. Kids can understand how it works and what it does. There's no slick plastic casing because I think children are more interested in things when they can see what's going on inside. With Mirobot, the mechanisms are all easily visible - it's designed to remove the mystery and help understanding.There have been a lot of iterations of the PCB to make sure it's easy for children (and adults!) to solder. Check out the blog post about this if you're interested. It comes with all of the parts you need to make sure it works. If you're not comfortable soldering, you can buy it in a pre-soldered version so you just snap everything together.Once you've put Mirobot together, it's time to start it drawing. One of the nice features of Mirobot is that all of the tools you need to start programming are already there on-board for you to use.All you need to do is make it join your WiFi network (or join its access point if you don't have one accessible) and then you can browse to its on-board web page that lets you use a Scratch-like visual programming tool.There are lots of ways of programming Mirobot. The easiest is to use the simple web-based GUI to set up the commands you want it to run - this is a lot like the original LOGO programming, but it's drag and drop. Once you graduate from this, you can move on to programming it more directly using a programming language.Mirobot is a completely open robotics platform - all of the code and designs are open-source so you can modify them to make it do exactly what you want. One of the big benefits of this is that as people make it do new and interesting things, they can be shared with the community to everyone's benefit.If you want to experiment with the Arduino then you can easily reprogram Mirobot with your own custom code. Want to add some sensors and make it sentient? There's an expansion port designed for just that.ChildrenThe main Mirobot user is children. It can be used with a wide range of ages, depending on the level of supervision. I've soldered and built one with my 5 year old daughter, but older children would require less supervision. Building your own robot is hugely satisfying and keeps children much more engaged in programming it.AdultsLearning about technology can be just as rewarding for an adult, especially if you do it together with a child. All of the learning points in Mirobot are just as relevant for adults.EducatorsOne of the areas I'm most excited about Mirobot being used is in schools. Robots have been used in schools since I was a child and they make a great multipurpose educational tool. There are lots of learning opportunities with Mirobot, including:I will be producing education support materials as part of the production of Mirobot. Graham Pirt is a very experienced education specialist (who also helped develop robots for schools using me as a test subject 30 years ago) who brings a high level of understanding of how robots can be used in a classroom setting to the project. He will be heavily involved in developing the learning support materials for Mirobot.Mirobot has been designed with a few key aims:Mirobot has been a long time in the making. I've been working consistently on Mirobot for coming up on a year now and it has gone through a number of evolutionary steps to get to the point where it is today. I wanted to get all of the wrinkles ironed out of the system before I decided to try and ramp up any kind of volume and that's the point I'm at now.I've gradually modified the design to use readily available components and to eliminate as many of the parts as possible. The entire chassis can be cut out of a 300mm x 300mm sheet of MDF and only requires 2 screws to assemble.The idea behind the timeline is to get the first batch out quickly to the early adopters so that any issues can be found and fixed before shipping out the finished products to the rest of the backers. Once they've shipped I'm counting on you to give feedback about how Mirobot worked so that I can improve things before pushing more out to a larger audience.My name is Ben Pirt. I've been working in technology for over 15 years, developing both hardware and software. I've got two kids that I love introducing to new and interesting things, which is where this project came from. On a visit to the London Science Museum (If you're in London, it's a must-visit!) with my family I came across one of the original BBC Turtles in an exhibition and was reminded of the times I spent using these robots as a child.I had the realisation that the massive progress in technology since that time (particularly with open platforms like the Arduino) meant that it should now be possible to build one of these using computer manufacturing and open hardware.When I was using the original Turtle it was a complex and very expensive piece of equipment and you were very lucky if there was even one per school. My vision is to help bring robotics back into mainstream education as a tool for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning. Recently there has been a grass roots resurgence around turning IT education back into the exciting learning that it used to be. Organisations like Code Club, Young Rewired State and others are doing great work pushing this agenda forward and (particularly in the UK and US) the curriculum is beginning to be changed to adapt to this.My goal is to build a company around products that can be made and used by children to learn about technology. My vision is that these products should be very different from the current crop of ICT learning tools used in schools - they should feel less like toys and be more understandable.This initial phase of development will enable me to get valuable feedback and real user testing so that I can make sure that what I build for schools will be suitable.For the geeks like me who want to know what's inside, here's a bit more detail to satisfy that need:After hitting the target so quickly, I thought some stretch goals might be in order:Credits: Thanks to Josh Woodward for the video music",Ben Pirt,"£26,652",Unstated,Mirobot is a DIY WiFi robot designed to help children learn about technology and programming.

( http://bit.ly/RoJJEX )~Some of you may be interested in the book ""Turtle Geometry"" by Abelson and DiSessa.This starts with the basic ideas of plane geometry and normal Turtle Graphics (using Logo, as it happens, but easily translated into other another language), then works through spherical geometry, non-Euclidean geometries and even curved space (as described by thingie, you know, what was his name - Einstein, that's it!) all the while using the intuitive nature of the following the turtle to make the ideas accessible.Hmm, a shame the Mirobot isn't magnetic or equipped with suction pads, otherwise you could explore spherical geometry by running it around the outside of the Imax globe in Bristol (other large metallic spheres are available). After that we could maybe find a singularity?~Ben, are you able to post more details about the wifi module? We talked about it at Maker Faire, and it seemed very cool, but I don't recall the model number.~Ben, are you by any chance using a 'phone app for all your KickStarter interactions, such as posting the update? As opposed to logging into the website using a normal web browser.I'm asking because in the last couple of months the KS website has started to show odd behaviour and I'm trying to guess what is going on (KS themselves are absolutely dreadful with support for their own site qua being a web site!). For example, it shows that you last logged in on 24th March but you've obviously been active here more recently than that...~Are you St makerfaire UK?~Congratulation :) can't wait to get mind. Is there any stretch goals?~Looking forward to it. I made a live-coding editor for turtle drawing in JavaScript here: http://meemoo.org/blog/2013-02-11-live-code-editor-javascript-to-svg/~Seeing an actual Mirobot in action at the IoT London Meetup made that order a no-brainer.

11," OpenROV is an open source robotic submarine designed to make underwater exploration possible for everyone.  It's also an online community of professional and amateur ROV (remotely operated vehicle) enthusiasts on OpenROV.com.   We believe in the power of open source communities to create amazing tools and experiences. This is an invitation to become a co-developer of the OpenROV project.Important Note: The OpenROV Kit is a perfect introduction into the world of underwater exploration, but at this point it is very much a product for makers/developers. It's a blast to play with, but you should be ready to tinker with it. The kit involves soldering, gluing, and wiring of electronics.BackgroundThe ROV is the brainchild of Eric Stackpole (@eerrp) who wanted an easy way to explore a cave that was rumored to contain sunken treasure near his home. Pretty soon, a small team of interested onlookers began contributing to the design. The community grew to include beginner, amateur and professional engineers and scientists from over 50 countries. As the community grew, so did the proposed uses of the ROV -  from pollution monitoring in streams to species identification in Antarctica. The uses are only limited by your imaginationDesignThe OpenROV is 30cm long, 20cm wide, and 15cm tall.  It weights approximately 2.5kg and has been designed to go to depths of up to 100mA single (10cm outer-diameter by 18cm long) waterproof tube houses all electronics and other equipment that must be kept dry.  Equipment in the tube is mounted onto a rotating platform that can be tilted up and down with a servo.Three 800kv brushless motors power the ROV.  Two horizontal thrusters allow the ROV to move forward and aft as well as rotate, and a vertical thruster allows the (neutrally buoyant) vehicle to change depth.OpenROV has been tested in ocean water to depths of 20m.  8 on-board C batteries supply about 1-1.5 hours of run time.FAQsHow deep can it go?  Structurally, OpenROV has been designed to go to 100m depth. However, we've only tested it to depths of about 20m so far.  Does it work in salt water? Yes, but the salt water accelerates the corrosion of the brushless motors. Our current strategy has been to spray them with silicon mold release before use and to give them a fresh-water rinse after every salt water dive. This seems to work pretty well, but more testing is needed. If the motors do need to be replaced, they are low cost and off the shelf. The community is working hard to develop ways to make the motors run longer and stronger.Do you have interns from the University of North Alaska? 
No, not yet.How fast does the ROV travel/ what kind of current can it fly in?With the current propellers we are using (which still have plenty of room to be optimized), the ROV moves at about 1m/s.  We're looking for propellers that will be more efficient, and we are even investigating the possibility of making our own, so if you happen to be an aerospace engineer, we could use your help!
How is the ROV powered?We use 8 on-board C batteries (which are mounted in the two white tubes at the bottom of the ROV).  These allow the ROV to fly around for about an hour. Higher capacity batteries could be used to make the ROV last longer, but we wanted to use something available everywhere. There are also ways to send power for the ROV down the tether, but that's still in the community development phase.How is the ROV controlled?Flying the ROV is a lot like playing a video game. The interface is hosted as a webserver from the ROV that allows you to control its movements with your computer's keyboard and see it's video feed on your screen.  We're also developing an interface that will use a USB game controller.  Eventually, we plan to make the ROV controllable via the internet, and our hope is that developers who get the kit through this Kickstarter project will have ideas for how to help.What comes after Kickstarter?We want this to be a sustainable adventure.  Our plan is to get user feedback from people who build and operate OpenROV's to make the design even better and more fitted toward the community's needs.  We plan to continue selling OpenROV Kits (and assembled OpenROVs) on our website as well as payloads and accessories for specific uses.  We also hope that by building a strong community of people who understand the hardware and its applications, we'll be able to develop ways of doing better science and exploration in more remote and interesting places. What's included in the kit?See here.Also, an important note on shipping: the reward tiers include shipping within the continental US. International shipping will cost extra. If you live outside the continental US, just let what your mailing address is and we’ll email you the amount to add to your pledge level to cover shipping.",OpenROV,"$111,622",Unstated,We've launched another campaign for a new underwater drone...,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,484 , I'm seriously looking forward to this.

Our goal is to create low-cost, high-quality components to improve the accessibility of marine robotics and to help explore the world's oceans. That starts with the T100 thruster.The T100 is a patent-pending underwater thruster designed specifically 
for marine robotics. It's high performing with over 5 pounds of thrust 
and durable enough for use in the open ocean at great depths. A variety of 
mounting options, simple control, and a low price tag make it the 
perfect thruster to use on your marine robot.Marine robotic vehicles come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and designs. They can be powered by batteries, solar power, through a tether, or even by waves. They can be small or large and can be equipped with tools for any mission. Nevertheless, nearly all of them have one thing in common: they have motors and propellers, the combination of which is commonly known as a thruster. Our interest in underwater thrusters began as part of a side project. We wanted to attach solar panels, a GPS unit, a microcontroller, and thrusters to a surfboard and send it from Los Angeles to Hawaii - completely autonomously. We were able to find all the components we needed, no problem, except for the thrusters. We could only find two options. The cheap option was to use regular brushless motors without protecting them. Unfortunately, they would corrode and break long before the surfboard made it to Hawaii. The expensive option was to use commercial-grade thrusters designed for remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs), but these ranged in price from $500 to $3,000 which was way out of our hobbyist budget. We realized that we, and thousands of marine robotics enthusiasts around the world, needed something better. That's why we designed the T100 thruster. We designed the T100 for:We're here on Kickstarter because we need your help to take the T100 thruster from prototype to production. We've gotten pretty far on our own, but now we need your financial backing to go the rest of the way. We'll use the Kickstarter funds to buy parts in bulk quantities, set up our assembly process, and ship the thrusters to you as quickly as possible. Your support will go a long way to help us get our company off the ground (and into the water!). We think the most exciting thing about building this product is seeing all of the awesome things that you guys find to do with it. Even after the Kickstarter, we will work hard to make sure that you can get the components you need for marine robotics! The T100 is basically a brushless electric motor, just like you’d find on an RC airplane or a quadcopter drone. The big difference is that this motor is purpose-built for use in the ocean and was designed specifically for use on remotely operated underwater vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, and robotic surface vehicles. Of course you could also use it to propel your stand-up-paddleboard or cruise around while scuba diving!The T100 is made of high-strength, UV resistant polycarbonate injection 
molded plastic. The core of the motor is sealed and protected with an 
epoxy coating and it uses high-performance plastic bearings in place of 
steel bearings that rust in saltwater. Everything that isn’t plastic is 
either aluminum or high-quality stainless steel that doesn’t corrode.A specially designed propeller and nozzle provides efficient, powerful thrust while active water-cooling keeps the motor cool. Unlike other thrusters, our design doesn’t have any air- or oil-filled cavities - water flows freely through all parts of the motor while it's running. That means it can go deep in the ocean and handle extreme pressures.The thruster is easy to use: just connect the three motor wires to any brushless electronic speed controller (ESC) and you can control it with an RC radio or a microcontroller. It's usable with Arduino, ArduPilot, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and many other embedded platforms.Key FeaturesPerformanceElectricalPhysicalDimensional DrawingYou can download a CAD model here.

Performance Plots Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) Specifications We've reached over 100% of our funding goal. Now we have some stretch goals that make the T100 even more awesome. The first is a versatile mounting bracket that will come free with all thruster rewards if we hit $40,000.You do not need the mounting bracket to mount the thruster, but with the bracket there are more mounting options. It allows you mount the thruster to almost anything and in particular to flat surfaces like the bottom of a boat. Check it out in Update #3.Awesome job everyone, Stretch Goal #1 has been achieved! The second stretch goal is a big deal: it's an integrated electronic speed controller that is water-proof, water-cooled, compact, and has PWM and digital I2C input signals. By integrating the ESC with the thruster, it saves space in your vehicle's hull, reduces heat, and really simplifies wiring of the vehicle. We won't go into details here because this page is already too long. Check out more details in Update #4.Stretch Goal #3 has been unlocked! Please check the pledge table for the proper pledge amount to upgrade or add $40 each to upgrade from T100 to T200 as well as $25 for basic ESCs instead of $20.Stretch Goal #3 is the T200 Thruster, a more powerful thruster that is the same size as the T100 and uses many of the same components. The T200 is better for larger applications like kayaks, stand-up paddleboards, and other human-carrying vehicles. The T200 will have around 4.5 kgf (10 lb) of thrust and use 260-300 W of power.Read more about it in Update #8 and Update #10!The
 SolarSurfer is a robotic surfboard propelled by two T100s. It will be launched from the coast of California on a 2,500 mile journey to Hawaii. It will complete the three-month trip completely autonomously. You will be able to track it live on our 
website. The code is all open source so that you can build your own!We're
 offering a very limited number of copies of the SolarSurfer for anyone 
who is interested in contributing to the project and launching their 
own! Hardware/software experience required.Source Code: github.com/blueroboticsThe OpenROV is an awesome project that originally has its roots in 
Kickstarter as well. They've since grown into a thriving community of 
marine robotics enthusiasts.We're offering an OpenROV Compatible Kit that allows you to replace the OpenROV's original brushless motors with the T100 thruster for much more thrust, efficiency, and better resistance to saltwater. The upgrade kit has two stock T100s plus one that has been modified for use as the vertical thruster on the OpenROV. It also includes some hardware you'll need to make the upgrade as smoothly as possible.OpenROV Website: openrov.comWe've also made our own ROV that uses six 
thrusters to provide six-degree-of-freedom control. That might seem 
excessive since most ROVs only have 3-4 thrusters, but with six degrees-of-freedom you can point the ROV in any orientation to film anything, grab anything with a simple robot arm, and have a lot of fun!At the surface, it's controlled through a laptop with an XBox controller.All
 the code is open source and under development if you'd like to check it out! We're offering a
 few copies of this vehicle to any adventurous hackers out there who 
want an ROV that's ready to develop code on! Hardware/software

After studying aerospace engineering (B.S.) and control systems (M.S.) at the University of Southern California, Rusty was part of a team designing, building, and testing a large-scale gas-powered multicopter for use by the military before shifting to marine robotics. In his free time he loves surfing, skiing, and photography.Joe Spadola is from Phoenix and has a passion for robotics. He 
studied mechanical engineering at Arizona State University with an 
emphasis on modeling and simulation. He has worked on computational 
fluids dynamics and thermal analysis of jet turbine engines, designed 
and built autonomous vehicles, consumer product design, and fatigue 
analysis. In his free time he loves surfing, music, and drawing.Josh Villbrandt is from Los Angeles and is an avionics engineer at SpaceX during the day and long time lover of robotics. He studied aerospace engineering (B.S.) followed by intelligent robotics (M.S.) at the University of Southern California and has built autonomous ground robots, quadcopters, airplanes, and now marine robots. In his free time he loves climbing, sailing, and playing guitar.We're very far along in the development process at this point. Initially, we built about four drastically different prototypes before settling into our current design. Since then we've made about four revisions to fine tune and improve the performance.In April 2014 we won the Proto Labs ""Cool Idea! Award"", providing all of
 the tooling for our injection molded plastic parts. The injection molding tooling has been completed and we have prototype parts. Proto Labs has been
 awesome and incredibly supportive of us and the T100 thruster.Several of the parts are sourced from China and we have an excellent supplier there who has provided us with production prototypes. At this point, we need your help to raise enough funding to buy all the components in bulk quantities, to set up our assembly line, and get the first batch of thrusters out the door. Because we already have our tooling made and we've made production prototypes with all of the real parts, we expect things to move very quickly.

I also have one hyperbaric chamber simply made from a scuba tank, but it is too dangerous to reveal it (using air pressure).Regarding the jammed thrusters, you can use a protective mesh as seen in the movie Ghosts of the Abyss (the small ROVs inside Titanic), but maybe it is overkill just for seaweed avoidance.~Where are we at with these? Another update would be great!~Everything still on track to start rolling out this month? Excited to get these and finalise my ROV.~My best wishes to your team and the solar surfer actual travel journey!!!!~Are mean how are you going to repel sharks :)~Your solar surfer looks yummy from underwater. Are you going to deal with it?~So, I've been a submarine sonar technician for the last 12 years and Murphy's law usually trumps the big ocean little submarine ,or in this case research surfboard, theory. IMHO it would be money well spent to include an AIS transponder and some form of beacon. The AIS system would allow other traffic in the area to see in real time where the board is, how fast its moving, and its destination among other things. A lot of the merchant traffic out there runs on ""auto pilot"" once in open ocean and wouldn't even notice your vehicle as they ran it over. Just a thought take it for what its worth.~On the subject of the solar surfer; have you thought of how you're going to avoid being run over by one of the big merchant ships that run between Hawaii and California?~Please do not forgot the solar surfer. We really want to follow the travel of the robot. : )~Hey BlueRobotics, just wanted to drop you a message:I am thankful that this Kickstarter was a success and I am really impressed by your work so far. Good job and a great Idea! I lack all the skills you need to develop underwater vehicles (software, electronics are my special field, not construction) but I always wanted to create a underwater prototype. I quickly run in the same problem, no affordable thrusters for fun projects. So to see your great work gives me some hope for the next years.Good luck with everything!~@Creators: Would one be able to order (from overseas) some T200+accessories further ahead (once they become available for instance)? I was planing to use two T200s in a sit-on-top kayak, which would allow some maneuverability, but the time is not right for the expense right now :(~Will you be providing more Assembled BlueROV's?  I think that they are assembled and tested  is a great service.~Do you have technical drawings of the T100/T200 Thruster with installed BlueESC? It would be great for construction.~Hi BlueRobotics, I'm at the $825 BlueROV level and was considering upgrading to BlueESCs (+150) and T200s (+240). But I'm looking at the table which says it will be $1335. Is this correct? Shouldn't it be $1215?~Great to hear we are moving forward with t200s.~I originally pledged $100.  If I change my pledge to $185 I will receive the T200 W/ Integrated BlueESC, even though that Reward Level is not offered as a selection?~Saw your new announcement of the T200. ~BlueRobotics: Remember, the BlueESC will only be available if we can hit $65,000 total. Don't add the money to you pledge for the BlueESC until we pass that point! Don't worry, we'll make it very clear when we've passed the stretch goal and remind you of all the options.~Question. I just updated my pledge to the amount for 2 T200 thrusters with blue esc. Where do we put it to tell you what we want since it is just pledged in the spot for 1-6 t100 thrusters just we added more money?~Thanks Jason Fish, I read the comments below. I'm hoping the 10lbs will be enough, if not hopefully we will be able to buy more thrusters on the website when the time comes. I put a post about this on my local kayak fishing forum to try to get some more last minute pledges. Very excited to figure out how to get this all setup to my 12.8v 100ah LiFePO4 battery =)~Sooooo close!!!!YES! I would like to add more to get the T200's for my BlueROV (with ESCs).  My total is currently $925 for the upgraded T100 (with ESC's).  Tell me what i need to add for the T200's (with ESC) and i will increase my amount.Only $1401 (as of 7:50am Sept 10) to go!  Come on folks, let's make this happen!  As a former Navy Submariner, this is a GREAT deal with unlimited potential!  Other companies sell thrusters for over $1000 and with less capability.  This IS a product for hobbyist and educators at a GREAT deal! I2C to control Six (or more) thrusters and using only one hull penetration to the external thruster control box – BRILLIANT!!! As we say in the submarine force- water in the “People-Tank” is bad, less hull penetrations is better and safer (SUBSAFE).  10lbs of thrust will allow for better vehicle positioning and lifting capability for your discovered treasures!  No more releasing the little crabs, grab the BIG-ONES! Warmest regards,Doyle~One time, I attached a 300 Watt scuba scooter to kayak. The battery lasts one hour. It costs about $200 from China.~Daniel, scroll down to my comment on September 1. Some good info from the BR team.~Been watching this for a while with the idea to use it on a fishing kayak. Currently the only motor options are a trolling motor which is big heavy bulky and inefficient and overpowered, or the torqueedo which is way overpriced and noisy due to gear reduction brushless. If the math is right the 10lbs of thrust should be enough to move the kayak along efficiently and it is a light weight compact application too! Can't wait to see if this will work!~http://store.3drobotics.com/products/hexacopter-power-distribution-board-1~Hi everyone who want T200 thruster, please increase your pledge accordingly ($40) for T200  now, so we can see if we can achieve 95k .. If not you can down your pledge again.. If only 40% of us the backer want T200, we easily can get 14k..~i hope we can get T200... 3 day and $16,000 more..~Guys, congrats on flying past your goal. Will you be selling the ESCs once the Kickstarter is finished (I assume you will, but just checking :) ) and if so can they be fitted retro-fitted to the T100?~Where can I find blueprints for BlueROV so I can prepare a build of material for other items to purchase.If no umbilical is included,  which type of CAT5/6 do you recommend to handle 500 foot pressure.By the way, what is the depth rating of BlueROV? (Pressure hull)~Are the cables you use longitudinally watertight, or how you can be sure that water isn't pressed thru the cable into the hul of the ROV?~I pledged for BlueROV - looking forward to it and have lots of time to allow for improvements.Any specs regarding the umbilical/hull connection?  What cabling/umbilical will be used and its hull connection?Is this included with BlueROV?~Even if the stretch goal is not reached, will you still be releasing the t200 thruster after the kickstarter is finished, and if so when would that be?~Regarding the integrated ESCs...I think it sounds awesome and I like they would be water-cooled versus worrying about heat pipes having to penetrate into an ROV hull....But before I commit - what happens if they fail...I plan to use with students and so what happens if say they wired something odd on the control side and burn one of these guys out...how easy to purchase and replace just the ESC?~",0.0,"$35,000",The T100: A Game-Changing Underwater Thruster by BlueRobotics — Kickstarter

About half of the Arduino memory and three quarters of the processing power are available after the balancing code and all the rest have taken their share.Here are some of the main robot features:Powering the robotThe robot takes 7 AA alkaline batteries. Its power-usage profile is also a very good fit for NiMH rechargeable batteries. For exploring alternative energy sources, it can also be powered by Open Fuel Cell's new Arduino shield.This is an optional shield that allows Lil’Bot to express its emotions through an emoticon-like LED display. “Allowed” expressions are afraid, amused, angry, blissful, cool, crying, disappointed, embarrassed, happy, impatient, naughty, neutral, nonplussed, outraged, proud, resigned, sad, sarcastic, shocked, smiling, and very sad. Give your robot that freedom!Lil’BlocksLil’Blocks is a block-based programming language based on Fred Lin's BlocklyDuino, a dialect of Neil Fraser's Blockly for Arduino. Blockly is the Hour of Code's choice language to introduce children to programming. For the younger child, block programming is little more than assembling Lego bricks, yet allows a firm grasp of basic programming concepts.Lil’Blocks translates all the block code to Arduino C, ready to compile and load into Lil’Bot from the Arduino environment. Please note that while younger children can easily learn block programming, some aspects of Lil’Bot require patient adult assistance to bring out all it has to offer.Stretch goalsIf this project goes well, I envision a few more shields for Lil’Bot.

After all, demand for awesome pancakes will never falter.""Includes everything you need to get cooking including commercial quality non-stick griddle!PancakeBot started off as a whimsical dream of Miguel Valenzuela to make a “Pancake Machine” out of LEGO for his two daughters who were 1 and 3. One day, while reading Make magazine, Lily, Miguel’s oldest daughter asked him what he was reading. He replied, “I am reading about a guy that made a pancake stamping machine out of LEGO.” Instantly Lily turned to her little sister Maia and said, “Papa’s going to build a Pancake Machine out of LEGO!” and thus PancakeBot was born.Miguel worked on developing and improving various LEGO designs and printed his first successful pancakes after 6 months of development. The PancakeBot was first reveled to the public at the World Maker Faire in New York. The response and interest from the public was so great that Miguel decided to build a more advanced version.Fastforward to 2014, when Miguel developed a more advanced acrylic version that was shown at the San Mateo Maker Faire and also the White House Maker Faire. The new more advanced version of the PancakeBot received even more publicity and interest. In order to bring PancakeBot to kitchens around the world, Miguel partnered with StoreBound, a company with the skills and expertise necessary to bring a refined version of the product to market by mid 2015.Miguel Valenzuela is a husband, father, inventor and artist who daylights as a civil engineer. Currently living in Norway, he spends his time teaching kids about the maker movement, designing and building robots, and working with his daughters on new ideas.Shipping within United States is included in your pledge.

Please respond.~Its been more than a year and i have been very patient, now i just demand for a refund.~Did this ship? I am in the US and never received.~This is really not acceptable one year and half of delay and until now I don't know when it will reach me.~I feel so angry that you guys sell the products and promote it in U.S. But the sponsors worldwide don't get their machines!~Hi from Hong KongJust wonder is there any update of shipment to Hong Kong pleaseThanks~update, please.~Hi StoreBound.  Till today I have not received my pledge, no communication on my request on estimate time of delivery. I was one of your first backers (believe in your project) and order a 6 pack, so appreciate your attention and priority on my request~Still didnt get my reward. Even after i wrote directly to creators and they promised to ship it. If shipped i didnt get any notifications or requests from customs or shipping company~When sent to China?Thank you very much!~Have all US orders shipped? I have not received mine yet. Thanks!~请问中国地区还要多久才能收到？~Hi, Any updates on when shipping to Singapore starts? I hope to get this in before Christmas :)~Any update?~Any update about my order?~I ordered and received two units.  I was going to give the second as a gift.  I have not given it because after many trials I had very poor results with the first unit I set up.  The air system did not provide enough pressure to dispense the batter to make even simple patterns.  I had problem with the design software or getting the designs into the unit.  If the batter was thinned any more it bled out with no air pressure.  I kept the air lines clean to make sure no batter could get into the motor.  The unit worked great when I hooked up a electric inflator for air mattresses and ran it when the head unit moved but that is a lot of fooling around and I certainly couldn't give the 2nd unit as a gift and say use some other equipment.

15," MeArm is a pocket size robot arm. It was conceived to make robotics, electronics and programming accessible - by driving down the cost of robot arm ownership. The ultimate aim is to make something low cost that you can build with nothing but a screwdriver and enthusiasm.========================================================Update! After hitting our initial target so quickly we've decided to go for some stretch goals! ========================================================Apart from being something that's small, cool and attractive the MeArm is a miniature version of an industrial robot arm. So while it's simple enough to build and use with a child on a rainy Sunday afternoon - it can also be used at more advanced levels of education to teach real robotics.The MeArm project is Open Source. This means all of the design and code files are freely available for you to download, so that you can view, edit, learn from all of the work that has been put into the project so far. This covers the files for laser cutting, the PCB board schematics and board files (which are KiCad) and all of the software.This means if you start your rainy Sunday running your MeArm manually from the joysticks, you can very quickly progress through basic examples to automate the movements and then onto some advanced robots by early evening. Even take the measurements directly from the design files and work though the trigonometry with a slide rule should the mood take you. By making everything that we have available you can learn about anything from robotics, to electronics, to programming in any number of languages with the MeArm project. (Video Courtesy of Robert Fischer under Creative Commons Attribution Licence)Being Open Source also means that the project has already traveled the globe, with builders making them from all sorts of materials in 6 out of 7 continents (Antarctica is lagging behind as ever - if you can solve that please get in touch). Not only have we seen the MeArm built around the world but we've seen them used for workshops, for sale on websites and even in other crowd funding campaigns! Each of those builders has contributed to the success of the MeArm and we hope to see even more ""Wild"" arms out there after this Kickstarter campaign.Up to now the MeArm has been something for those who are happy to tinker with electronics. We want to use Kickstarter to help us provide a platform to achieve the ""Screwdriver and Enthusiasm"" goal. This platform is the MeBrain.The MeBrain has two joysticks to control the MeArm. You plug the robot arm into it and it into a power supply and you will be able control the arm and even record a few movements to play back.It is an Arduino-Compatible device built on the same chip as the Arduino Leonardo, so although you don't have to know anything about Arduino to make use of and have fun with the MeArm you have the immensely useful Arduino ecosystem at your disposal should you want to take your exploration further.There are already some excellent code examples available for the MeBrain - provided by the amazing Bob Stone and there are even 30 tutorials to help you learn to code on the MeArm from one of our Open Source collaborators from Taiwan.With the MeBrain the MeArm will be the most open and accessible robotics project in the world, we hope it will find uses in schools, universities and anywhere where encouraging engagement in science, technology, engineering and maths is important. We really should include art in there too as the MeArm is a fairly handsome bit of kit, thanks to the design aesthetic of Jack Howard, and it's use in kinetic sculpture has often been discussed.You can see we've already done a lot of development on the MeArm and MeBrain, but we hope to increase the speed at which we're able to operate with your help.",Benjamin Gray,"£24,855",Unstated,"Low cost, easy to build and simple to control, MeArm is designed to make learning with robotics accessible for everyone.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,429 ," Congratulations Ben :) What now? Going to keep us informed through Kickstarter, web blog, forum? Looking forward to some images in updates :)~Hi Ben, very very good campaign ;)With all that, could you show us what the MeBrain that we will receive will look like now ?~Missed my chance to add the 10£. Do I have options?~Well added the £10 doesn't look like we'll get the potato salad ;)~Yay woke up in time to assist my pledge :) running on kiwi time can be a problem ha ha.~Hi Ben, I just been adding £10 too for both controllers. Hope this will help reach the 22500 !~@Benjamin Yea I'm having difficulty thinking of a good motion library. Thought about making a handheld rollerball device(ballbearing style) for easier one hand control.~Really thank you and congratulations for your success~Hi Ben, i've pledged e plastic meArm but i'm quite amazed by the gold metallic version, which is the width of the beams composing the latter? are the beams just made of a metallic layer or the metal have been bended in order to obtain a rectangular profile?~Thought you guys might be interested in this. Not sure exactly how to incorporate it, but I'm gonna give it a shot and see what I can do with a hands free controlled MeArm. http://codeduino.com/information-and-news/hardware/3d-pad-touchless-3d-controller/~Great. More tools to experiment with. Thank you~Hello. I've added to my pledge for the sliders. Is the extra amount to upgrade or include the sliders?~Hi Ben, I've also just added £10 to my pledge for joystick and sliders.~Hi Ben, I've also just added £10 to my pledge for joystick and sliders :-) Looks like those of us who have done so has taken the project over £22,500 :-)~I would aso like to have joystick and sliders. May I add £10 to my pladge?~Hi Again ben, im interested in also getting an extra controller (one slider and one normal), I have pledged 68, if I wanted to do that then how much would I need to add.~Is there a reward planned that includes both the joystick and sliders? Making that available now might push you over the 25,000 mark because people would upgrade to have both.~@Bob, It would be great if MeArm could have connected to RPi by BT or Wifi modules ;-)~Hi there been in terms of the controller having pots for the joysticks would be great. What i would like to know it's how do the current joysticks work. Ate they just 4 tactile switches each so only register a on or off status (or something like that)??~@Andrei - I've had working RPi code since May via Adafruit servo driver board: https://github.com/RorschachUK/meArmPi~Hi, Ben,In the previous stretch goal list there was useful option for RPi connectivity. Are you going to implement this feature further?~Only £1,000 away from the £20,000 stretch goal!!!!~Could you give us the link for Android APP please Ben ?~Now that we have reached the stretch goal for Bluetooth support, are you going to begin to look at creating apple/android apps for it?~Or to display battery voltage for the future autonomous MeArm ;)A LiPo (1S) 3.7V 2000mA + http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/LiPo-Rider-Pro-p-992.html  and voila ;)~It seems that wireless possibility boosted the campaign Ben ;)HC05 module for classic BT is cheap and widely used ;)A LCD to show what, for example ?~Sorry I meant #MeArm v0.4.~Hi Ben, a decent WiFi module is the Esprino ESP8266, very small and cheap. It can be purchased on eBay http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/ESP8266%20ESP-01~Hi Ben, if you're reworking the brain / controller PCBs, a very useful addition would be a Wii I2C interface allowing a Nunchuck or Wii Classic controller to be added, they just need the right shape of exposed PCB traces routed to the I2C pins, see @boeeerb's multichuck for instance: http://www.boeeerb.co.uk/product/multichuck-adaptor/ - the Wii classic controller can be had for under a fiver on eBay and has way more buttons than you will want to be faffing with.  Another quick win is adding headers for XBee footprint radio modules or even easier, Ciseco ERF module - this way you're adding flexible capacity for adding various flavours of radio onto the controller without the expense or the commitment of actually having to decide on, source or install the components yourself.~Excellent Ben !Even the classic Bluetooth (not BLE)?The wait going to seem very long ;)~I liked the idea of mounting the MeBrain on the MeArm and using a separate controller.  Initially a cable could be used to connect the controller to the MeBrain. Some users at a latter date might want to upgrade their setup and connect a wireless controller to the MeBrain at a latter date.~Yes, support the design decision of keeping the controller on the main board. In terms of UI, I'd personally feel that investing in more than a rudimentary set of manual controls will not add much value compared to something like BTLE, where that problem can be moved to software.~Just wanted to put my support in for keeping the ""brain"" on the main board. This will make it easier to interface it with other controllers including the Raspberry Pi.~",0.0,"£5,000",MeArm - Pocket Sized Industrial Robotics for Everybody by Benjamin Gray — Kickstarter
16," Thank you Kickstarter for all your support!  We’ve over-funded by a good margin and are psyched to begin production of MOSS.  Since this page is locked after the campaign closes, you can learn more about MOSS and our progress at http://www.modrobotics.com.If you missed your chance to pre-order MOSS on Kickstarter, add your email to the list on modrobotics.com/moss and soon you'll be able to get in on the next round to reserve your own MOSS robotics system!MOSS is a brand new robot construction system from Modular Robotics. It was designed, prototyped and engineered over the last two and a half years. Building with MOSS is incredibly fun and easy thanks to an intuitive, magnetic construction system. With MOSS there is no need for coding or wiring your construction. The power and data are sent through an elegant single button contact, while the ground passes through the steel spheres.MOSS uses over-molded neodymium, ""rare earth,"" magnets and carbon steel ball bearings to build a wide variety of constructions. The tactile click of building with MOSS is enough to keep you entertained for hours.It's easy to snap MOSS modules together to make a static structure, but to make things move and light up, you'll need to understand the color coding system for the individual faces.  Keep in mind that production MOSS kits will be different colors from the versions shown here.  We'll use these versions for this example, though, since we're surrounded by the pretty colors. Yellow faces conduct power.  If you look at the BATTERY module, you'll see that it has only yellow faces; this module's main purpose is to supply power to other modules.  To power up a MOSS module like a SPIN, for instance, you'll need to connect one of its yellow faces directly or indirectly to one of the yellow faces on a BATTERY module.  Blue and green faces conduct data: blue is data output and green is input.  If you want a DISTANCE sensor to control the speed of a SPIN, for instance, you'll need to connect the DISTANCE's blue data out to the SPIN's green data input.  Get it?  There's only one more face, the pink passthrough face, which can pass any signal, either power or data.  If your BATTERY is a few modules away from something you need to power, use the pink faces on a FLEXIBLE module (or a few single cubes in series) to transfer the power.Stretch Goal One Unlocked!Our first stretch goal has been unlocked! Visit MOSS update #3 for details!Stretch Goal Two Unlocked!We've hit $304k, so we'll ship all T-shirts out in December instead of waiting to ship them with your MOSS kits on February 2014.  USA backers, we're aiming to send your shirts just in time for Christmas! Our goal is to get them to you in time to have them wrapped and under the tree. International backers, we will be sending your shirts out in December, but given the wide geographic spread of backers we can't guarantee pre-Christmas delivery of your shirt. Thank you for your continued support of Modular Robotics and MOSS!Stretch Goal Three Announced:We're pleasantly surprised about all of the inquiries we've received about programming MOSS.  Clearly, you want the ability to program your MOSS robots however you like!  If we hit $564,000, we'll be able to fast-track the development of two tools for MOSS programming:  MOSS Flash, which will let you write low-level C programs and flash them via Bluetooth into your MOSS modules, and MOSS Scratch, an integration with Scratch, the popular and easy-to-use block programming system.  Eric wrote a blog post with some more details on these new plans.Work on MOSS began in 2010 as a research project funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the ASEE. Since then, we've been working to turn MOSS from a concept to a production ready robotics kit.MOSS started with sketches, ideas, and thousands of prototypes. The original concept used 3D printed frames, laser cut faces, copper connections and hand strung wire. Over thousands and thousands of hours in development, the various product concepts became the prototypes you see now. Over that time, while we were producing and selling Cubelets, we learned all about injection molding, over-molding magnets, metal stamping, and the other mass-production manufacturing processes needed to make MOSS on a commercial scale. One big challenge was getting enough magnetic holding force between blocks so people could build large constructions. We solved this with custom rare-earth magnets that have a concave face for maximum contact with the steel spheres.The plastic shells for MOSS were designed to snap together with appropriate draft angles for injection molding. The magnets were over-molded into the plastic shells in order to eliminate any chance of them coming out. Now that we've got the designs dialed, we're excited to share our work with you.The prototypes you see in the video represent ""T2"" plastics construction. We are tweaking the last few details before we order production ready plastics from our suppliers. Other parts like the microcontrollers and circuit boards are already on order. We expect Modular Robotics will receive final MOSS production ready components in mid-December 2013. Our supply chain manager has toured our plastics and battery suppliers and verified that everything is proceeding according to plan. Production and assembly are scheduled to start near the holidays, continuing through January and beyond!All MOSS modules will be hand assembled in our robot factory in Boulder, CO.  It's uncommon to build toys or consumer electronics in the USA, let alone in Boulder.  But fundamentally, we believe that by making our robots ourselves is the right thing to do.  It's fun, too, especially since we get to build robots to help us build robots. Here's how we assemble circuit boards.  Just like our previous product, Cubelets, we're building everything ourselves so that we can ensure high quality and adapt quickly to changing conditions. Every assembly step of every MOSS module will be tested as it progresses through our factoryOrders for each kit type will be fulfilled on a first come, first served basis. So the sooner you support our campaign, the sooner you can start playing with MOSS! We are going to start shipping kits as soon as we have modules, packaging and instruction booklets ready.One note on color... The robots shown here are all prototypes.  Production MOSS will have better tolerance, fit, and finish.  But we haven't chosen the colors yet!  We may pick a color scheme that you hate, which is a risk.  Currently we really like this one, but it's not final. ",Modular Robotics,"$361,293",Unstated,"Build your own robots with MOSS! Simple, fun, magnetic robot construction kits.

A little communication goes along way. Thanks for the much needed update and managing expectations. Really looking forward to receiving my kit. Keep up the good work.~Thanks MR this update #10 is well explained and included greatly needed detail to help me and other backers understand what we where seeing on other websites. Updates like this are needed consistently to help keep backers informed and happy with their investment because no matter how little you have to say in update, keeping us in the loop will help us believe in you product and your company. ~Thanks for the comprehensive update.  Really good to understand what you're up against.  And remember-  we're not just customers; we're backers, and that means we should be understanding when a company that's trying to get successful goes through the inevitable difficulties all such companies come upon.  This just made it a whole lot easier to be understanding : )  Keep up the good work!~Although I list these websites as places of sale for their basic builder kits I still want to give MR the chance to explain. Who knows maybe the reasonable doubt may just be that modular robotics has never approved the kits to be for sale on these 3rd party websites and could lead us to be the victims of false advertisement. it's definitely possible this could happen so let's see what they have to say in 22 hours.;-)~Yet another place I found online selling the basic builder kit! To me it looks more and more like modular robotics has gone back on their kick-starter promise to deliver their kits to the backers first. Just look!!~It would be great if Modular Robotics is more active on Kickstarter pages as it'll most definitely help allay any concerns, if and when they arise. Instead they seem to have taken the point of view ""less said the better"" or worse still ""lets not say anything at all"".!~I emailed and received a response that shipping update would come later this week. It is frustrating that we continue to have delays, especially as @jake olah mentions it's available on a separate site. ~I guess it could be possible it was a backer. Its just an odd coincidence that this possible backer not only has an eBay account but also has a educational science business that has a fully functional website and 24 seven customer service over the phone and lists the basic builder kit on the web site instock and ready for sale. Again it is possible the could have gone back on their kick-starter promise that backers would receive the first kits released. This is an independent business trying to make it in the educational science market with a new product while also making a product in USA it can be kind of a struggle for anyone so why wouldn't they try to push their product to the vendors so that they can make more income instead of just giving it all to the to the backers first, after all they have struggled with some developmental issues which is costly to a business & plus you need to remember that money is everything to a business trying to produce new product and put it on the market! Please just take a look a look at the website that I listed below and investigate for yourself I promise you I'm not judging too quickly I believe that they are shipping to their vendors before completing their Kick-starter promise that their backers get them first.~@Jake Olah, @Michael -- I have to agree with Michael, given that they had already created cubelets, and there was such a big discount on the basic kits, it seems lke a pretty smart business move to order a bunch of basic kits early, planning to resell them.  Based on everything I have seen about the guys at Modular Robotics, it seems highly unlikely they'd start shipping a bunch to their vendors before finishing their kickstarter orders.~@Jake Why do you assume this ebay seller is a vendor? Could be who supported the Kickstarter Project got their Basic Kits (which from reading comments here looks like are the only ones that have shipped) and then turned around and sold them on Ebay. People do that you know.~I guess their more worried more about getting the product to their vendors and not their backers found basic builder kit on eBay just look they say they have 8 in stock heres the link for all the backers that will feel betrayed!~Update on shipping of advanced builder kits please.~Any update on the Advanced Builder kit? Would love to get this soon!~Just got mine (basic builder), it is awesome. My son (5) and I are having a great time with it!~Received our kit today however there was no blue tooth piece. Is this being shipped separately?~What's the ETA on the rest of the kits? Looking forward to receiving mine soon.~I ordered the basic builder kit and it arrived yesterday. It was nicely packed in a custom box.  The basic builder is now different from what I ordered. It was upgraded, it's now white with a few more parts and spheres. The instruction book was easy to follow with illustrations. That was helpful for me since I have no programming, tech or even creative skills. I was able to build each items in the book and it works great. It was worth the wait. My son thought the T-shirt was Cool.~Thanks for the update. Please don't burn out the team in the attempt to meet the deadline. Murphy's law rules and especially so with the first batch of anything.~We are getting really close to ""middle of march"". Any update? are you still on track? :)~Hello, it is quite a while since you posted an update and the position was that shipping was expected from the middle of March onwards.  Is it possible to have an update please?~Hello!  Glad you guys are up and running!!  I need to provide a new shipping address. Can you send me a direct message?  Thanks!~@Modular Robotics -- I'm sure you've seen this already, but I thought I would post this for the other MOSS Supporters. This is a story Engadget did today on the MOSS Kits. http://www.engadget.com/2014/02/17/moss-robot-kits/~My son is dying to hear some news! How about a shipping update?~Glad to see I'm not the only one looking for some news :)~No announcement as planned end of week last week.... ?~We are getting very anxious to receive our kit!  My 12 year-old is going crazy with anticipation and loves his prized, MOSS T-shirt. Any information about expected shipping dates?~Do you know when will be receive the t-shirt in spain? We didn't receive yet and i've seen other people receive it ( from usa) Thanks !!~How come we haven't seen any pics of the tank? I am hoping the next update will be news of shipping... :)~Hi all,~Still no t-shirts, I have sent a message also~Hey Gang! I replied to the email concerning the international t-shirt shipping last week, and I said that I was totally cool with receiving my t-shirt with the rest of my things. However, in the latter part of the message, I stated that I need to give you an updated address that is different than the one that I put on the initial survey for the t-shirts and how the money was to be distributed (light señor/bluetooth and such). I have yet to receive a reply, and I know that you all must be extremely busy, I would just really appreciate if someone could get back to me or provide a way for me to change my address so that everything goes to the correct place! I am very excited for MOSS, and I hope everything is going wonderfully down there in California!~Did the T-shirts ever ship because I never received mine?~It's almost mid-January -- How about an update (even if it's a small one) on the status of Moss?~hi can I change my shipping address?  i am not able to change it manually~My t-shirt arrived in Southern California today as well.

17,"          After three years of work, we are proud to be back on Kickstarter to present the Mine Kafon Drone: an unmanned airborne demining system that uses a three step process to map, detect and detonate land mines.The Mine Kafon Drone is up to 20 times faster than currently available technologies. The Mine Kafon Drone (MKD) offers an innovative solution to land mine removal, providing a reliable demining system that delivers accurate updates and information on mine clearing operations.   The Mine Kafon Drone flies over dangerous areas to map, detect and detonate landmines from a safe distance. The drone works autonomously equipped with three separate interchangeable robotic extensions.
These three methodologies combined makes the MKD up to 20 times faster than traditional demining technologies. As well as being safer, it also up to 200 times cheaper. First the drone flies over the whole field with an aerial 3D mapping system to identify all the dangerous areas with GPS way points.Equipped with a robotic metal detecting arm the MKD hovers above the ground at approximately 4 cm to detect mines. Every detected mine is geotagged on the operator's system to construct a map of known mine locations.For the final phase of the process the MKD, attached with a robotic gripping arm, places a small detonator on every detected mine. The land mine is then detonated from a safe distance using a timer.   There are 100 million land mines worldwide. Every day, 10 innocent civilians are killed or maimed by these explosives. 
Today, land mines can still be found in more than 60 countries, constituting a significant risk to communities across the globe. In these countries, the victims are mostly civilians – children, women and the elderly – with tens of thousands of innocent people killed every year, and many more injured, serving as a horrific reminder of the past. Using current technologies, clearing or even detecting all land mines across the entire world would take over 1100 years. The established processes are slow, dangerous and expensive, and completely unacceptable if we want to solve the problem in our lifetime.      MKD offers a number of crucial advantages over the products currently used by demining organisations. What if we could wipe out all the land mines and explosives in less than 10 years?        Growing up on the edge of Kabul in a little town called Qasaba in Afghanistan, Massoud and Mahmud Hassani, the brothers behind the Mine Kafon Drone project, experienced the horrors of land mines from an early age. These experiences fuelled Massoud Hassani to develop a solution for a safe and smart solution to detect and clear land mines. Following Massoud’s first successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013, backed by 4200 backers from all over the world, the Mine Kafon Foundation was founded. The Mine Kafon Foundation is an R&D organisation based in the Netherlands. In the past 3 years, Massoud and Mahmud have been raising awareness by giving lectures around the world and developing new approaches on how to fight land mines in different environments. In this way, they have crowdsourced many engineers and designers from all over the world and invited them to collaborate and volunteer on this humanitarian project. ""So far, we have already developed several working prototypes of the Mine Kafon Drone. We have performed tests with the Dutch Ministry of Defense on their territory and spoke with their experts on demining difficulties. The Mine Kafon Drone is now ready for its next step.""         It is now time for a pilot study showcasing the MKD’s capabilities. This is crucial for the actual development and production of the Mine Kafon Drone because we need to prove to governments, the UN and NGOs that the MKD works as a reliable and unmanned demining system. This also allows us to test different weather conditions and environments. Following these tests, we will be able to finalize details for the batch production of Mine Kafon Drones.With the Mine Kafon Drone we can save thousands of lives. Civilians will have access to agriculture, water resources, education, and the freedom to play outdoor sports. A billion people currently cannot move freely for fear of mines. Can you imagine that we could liberate these people in all affected countries with the Mine Kafon Drone?  We need your backing to reach our goal in realizing the safety of people in need. By supporting the Mine Kafon Drone project, you will help the world get rid of land mines, save thousands of lives, rescue the affected natural landscapes and help build the economies for those in need. Join our Kickstarter campaign and spread the word. All your pledges will go directly towards developing the Mine Kafon drones. Thanks for your support for bringing this project to life.

Nice.I am not sure if I will ever wear it, but that was not the point I gave my money. ;)~Any updates on the rewards? I filled in my backer survery almost 1 year ago!~I got my email for the survey this morning and responded.~I backed a campaign that succeeded in collecting the pledges they needed but then failed to complete the project. In that case they refunded about 70% so don't berate all campaigns because of one bad experience.~Hmmmm it was just a bracelet to me.... but it might be someone's legs... are they at least working??~Its September - seriously, how long does it take to post rewards out when they were all ready to go back in JULY!?~Just a quick message to let you know that because of your lack of communication and your empty promises about rewards....(I mean seriously, if they were packed and ready for shipping on July 20th, maybe the next step would be taking them to the post office or wherever! It might seem petty for everyone to be going on about these rewards but this is how this stuff works you know)... I will never again back anyone on Kick starter.....well done you! Meanwhile there are a hell of a lot of mines fucking up people that you seem to be no nearer actually getting rid of.....I hope I am wrong about that.~Happy to hear about the progress. I hope to see a world free on war and mines.I am not sure if you have my new address. how can I get it to you?~Congrats on your new team, offices and accolades.  Regarding rewards, the update says to send a mail for address change but no address is supplied.  Also my understanding was a rewards survey is to be sent out to collect addresses for shipping but I've not received one so I'm unclear what addresses you might have.  ~Congratulation for the new team guys (and ladies) : ) ~Hi MassoudIt's good to hear that people's rewards should be shipping out soon, but I'm sure most backers are more concerned with progress on the project rather than receiving a physical reward. You can keep mine until it shows a real section of minefield which has been successfully demined. Keep us posted on developments.Best to all on the team,Chris~Getting worried that we are being shafted here!~When are the awards being shipped please? I am still waiting for the bracelet for about a year now...~What's happening? Can you share your project plan?~I really dont understand this lack of commnunication. ppl invested 177k€ which is a 2-4 year worth of salary. And there has NOT been in update since APRIL What the actual FUCK! Not to mention the rewards which were ETA NOV2016 . Ill be moving in a few weeks and am still waiting for my very expansinve 50€ post card! This communication is really bad! Time to change!~An update is well overdue. Communication has been shockingly poor (which is a shame given how brilliant the concept is).~Dear Massoud, I support your good work, but some efforts for the rewards should be allocated now. We are waiting too long...~Hi MassoudGood to hear that things are going well. Looking forward to an update, and appreciate how busy you must be, so if in doubt keep them short. I think most people would be quite happy with a regular monthly update. That keeps them updated, they know when to expect them, and once yolu've got one out the way you can forget about it until the next one is due. The update I really want to get is the one saying that the first successful test on an actual mine field has taken place.Until then, keep up the good work.Chris~A whole new team or a new team member?~Any update on the rewards shipping?~Hi Massoud,Well done on placing highly in the competition. All backers support the fantastic work your team do.~Dear Massoud,~Hi Guys~Watched you guys on youtube during the Dubai competition, what a HUGE accomplishment to place 4th out of so many groups!  Just great for a little kickstarter project, you guys are making us PROUD!~Man, you guys are all about the tumbleweed :(~Alison: +1~Another update on how you did in the competition and status of the backer gifts would be good...~Ok guys, how did you do during the competition? Backing this campaign as many have said makes us feel good because of WHAT you are doing!!I am just getting a bracelet so I can prove I was involved. A little ego yes/no, but having the proof is nice too.~As you already know Colombia has been having the problem of the landmines also... have you consiudered in the future to extend your work overseas to other countries????~One more quick comment.~Massoud and team,~I've backed other Kickstarter projects, but I'm happiest about backing this project.  It's horrible that people are still maimed years after wars have been won or lost.  Thank you so much for allowing me to back this endeavor.  Congratulations on your progress!  I pray that you win the money this month!~Hi, thank you for letting me know about my shipping info for the bracelet. As other people mentioned, I'd rather want you to use the money for your ongoing project. I look forward to hearing more updates from you ;-)~Just got the survey request - I'd rather you use the cost of my reward for your work. You don't need to send me anything. I appreciate your efforts.~I have not received either (Cincinnati OH).  Sours the mood to consider sponsoring others.  Who accountable?~Any idea about the status of this project?~Don't know why but, I was expecting this campaign to be updated more often when i pledged.. boy was I (we) wrong?~nothing recieved here eather. @Massoud Hassani a good update cycle is every 4-6 weeks. it would be nice if you could provid updates in this kind of cycles. I know sometimes it just ""boring"" stuff. But i think i speak for all if i say that we are interessted in EVERYTHING! from problems in coding to drawbacks in design. Keep in mind that some of us could actually provide help! You wanted to make this projekt over kickstarter, a planfrom where the community in interessted in the product and the way towards its finish. I think the 3d Printer TIKO i doing a great job with the communication with there community. The do normal (with high information value ) updates through the update channel. And are very activ in the comment section with so called mini updates. And they profited a LOT from the community!~Has anybody received their pledge reward?   I didn't back this project for the reward of course, but for the cause represented.  There just seems to be no activity for this project.~I am still waiting for my pledge rewards, since july there were 2 updates. I Am not satisfied with this at all. Your pledgers made this project possible. You should take care if this part too i think.~I have not received my pledge reward yet. Any update?~Happy New Year, guys! Here's to a mine free future, with a big leap forward in 2017. Looking forward to seeing a map of a patch of ground, and knowing that I've helped to make it mine free, but that I couldn't have done it if you hadn't given me the means to.~That is very encouraging news for the project - well done to you and your team.~",0.0,"€70,000",Mine Kafon Drone by Massoud Hassani — Kickstarter
18," Yellowstone started a proud tradition of protecting our planet’s most unique environments when it became the world’s first National Park more than a century ago. However, there is a part of Yellowstone that very few people have visited. An entire ecosystem that is hidden from us at the surface. A place that scientists are eager to study and may harbor unknown life; the depths of Yellowstone Lake.We now know that the bottom of the Lake is far from barren, hosting species of crustaceans, sponges, and even small creatures that feed off of the Earth’s heat and chemistry rather than the Sun. ‘Thermophilic’ (or hot water-loving) microbes thrive in the relatively high-temperatures immediately surrounding active thermal features at the bottom of the Lake and scattered throughout Yellowstone Park. These creatures may be microscopic but they have the potential to profoundly influence the medical and biological sciences.The study of one particular microbial species found in the backcountry of the Park in the 1970’s, Thermus aquaticus (Taq), led to the development of the Nobel prize-winning method used to decode DNA and opened the floodgates to modern molecular biology. Researchers believe that because these organisms live in temperatures comparable to those inside the human body, analysis of their metabolic and physiological processes could to lead us to more effective treatments for cancer and other devastating human diseases. NASA scientists have also suggested that these thermal environments, and the unique lifeforms they support, might hold clues to the origin of life on this planet and possibly elsewhere in the universe.It is estimated that less than 1% of Yellowstone's microbes have been identified so far and it’s hard to predict what might be learned from those that have yet to be discovered. Many of these unknown species could be at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake right now, but the National Park Service does not have the tools needed to thoroughly characterize the Lake’s deep water ecosystem on their own.With your help we plan to support the National Park Service by building and operating ""Yogi"" the Robot, which will be capable of gathering the data they need to more thoroughly understand this unique ecosystem. It is now more feasible and cost-effective to develop a high-quality robotic platform than ever before and it’s finally time to take exploration in Yellowstone Lake to the next level.The Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration (GFOE) is a non-profit engineering organization dedicated to empowering the global science community with robotic tools to explore the world’s oceans and large lakes. GFOE is made up of engineers and explorers who design and operate vehicles used to study the bottom of the ocean and who now plan to build a robot to explore the largely unknown depths of Yellowstone Lake. With the launch of this Kickstarter campaign to build ""Yogi"" the Robot, we are pioneering a new way to fund underwater exploration--crowdfunding directly through the public, to produce high-definition underwater video and scientific data for the benefit and enjoyment of everyone.Our President and mentor, Dave Lovalvo, has been exploring the oceans and large lakes of the world with remotely operated vehicles (ROV’s) for over 30 years. In 1985, he had the opportunity to bring the first robotic technology into Yellowstone Lake as an extension of his previous work with underwater vehicles. He partnered with scientists who were interested in studying hydrothermal activity in the Lake at depths greater than what was possible with standard diving techniques. Dave designed the mechanical components, coded the software, and tested and operated this robot himself. This was at a time when ROV’s were an emerging technology and not widely used.Dave’s novel underwater vehicle was able to capture truly stunning video even with the relatively low-resolution cameras available in the early 1980’s. For the first time, humans were able to see the towering rock formations, sweeping plains, and colorful thermal vents at the bottom of the Lake. Dave and the scientists had discovered what is a complex ecosystem riddled with hydrothermal features as impressive as the geysers that have made Yellowstone so iconic. More than 30 years later, only one other person has gone back into the Lake with robotic technology to help characterize the unique features at its bottom.We no longer need to rely on one young engineer to design, build, and operate this kind of vehicle on their own. Dave has assembled a team of the brightest young minds in the industry and united them through our non-profit organization. The GFOE team already has experience building and operating underwater robots that explore deep ocean environments in some of the most remote places on Earth through a partnership with NOAA’s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research. Our engineers have successfully managed over 150 ROV dives at depths of up to 3.7 miles, providing ocean scientists with insight into some of the most inaccessible ecosystems on the planet. They have proven themselves to have the professionalism, talent, and determination to continue what Dave started and carry exploration in Yellowstone Lake through the next 30 years.As such, we are well positioned to build a next-generation robot designed by a new generation of engineers and create the capability for scientists in Yellowstone to make what could be some of tomorrow’s greatest discoveries.Yellowstone National Park and the Yellowstone Association have offered to provide guidance on the research priorities and on the education and outreach components of the work done by this new robotic platform. Other groups such as the highly-respected Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, U.S. Geological Survey, Oregon State University, University of Minnesota, and Montana State University will make important contributions in guiding some of the science that will be supported by the robot in the years to come.The cost of this kind of vehicle depends largely on its capabilities but they typically cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to build. However, MBARI has provided us with basic mechanical schematics and control software for ""Yogi"", GFOE engineers have already invested the time to adapt the design, and several major components have been privately donated to the project. One of these private donors has even offered a 1:1 match on any funds raised through Kickstarter, up to $100,000. This means that your donation will effectively be doubled. We have many of the important pieces in place but we need at least $100,000 in public support to raise the $200,000 required to actually build ""Yogi"" and move the project forward.Here is a summary of how GFOE hopes to use funds raised through Kickstarter, including the 1:1 match:""Yogi"" is designed to record high-definition video and enable scientists to collect delicate biological, geological, and chemical samples from thermal features at the bottom of the Lake. Some of its specifications include:Underwater vehicles of this kind typically have lifespans of 10-20 years which leaves ample opportunity down the road for this robot to explore other large lakes beyond Yellowstone. For now, we at the Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration hope to support scientists in a place that is cherished, provide valuable knowledge for future generations, and foster a growing community of young, passionate explorers.And, right now, you have the opportunity to help make this happen.",Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration,"$100,449",Unstated,We are engineers and explorers who plan to help Yellowstone scientists make what could be tomorrow's greatest discoveries.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,593 , ,0.0,"$100,000",New Robot to Explore the Depths of Yellowstone Lake by Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration — Kickstarter
19," Follow Us @Twitter and Facebook for updates and news!We're partnering with MiniBloq to bring Drag-and-Drop programming to Sparki! Easy robot programming, bringing the age range down to elementary, and opens robotics to whole new group of future roboticistsMultiple discounted Sparkis, special classroom materials like printed maze and line-following posters, and dedicated 1-on-1 instructor training.Ever wanted to learn robotics, programming or electronics?Thought robots were hard or complicated?Just didn't know where to get started?Sparki is an affordable, easy to use, and fun intro to programming, electronics, and robotics for all ages (11+). It is simple enough for  beginners, while being feature-packed enough to be a must-have for pro-users. Sparki is your chance to have your very own robot, completely open source and available to do your bidding. Sparki is ArcBotics’ answer to robotics in education. After our first successful Kickstarter for Hexy the Hexapod, a low-cost open-source Arduino robot designed to be an intro to advanced robotics, we were approached by many who asked, do you have anything for beginners? When we looked around, we saw that other educational robots were very expensive, difficult to use, lacked features, or had closed designs. However, we know that the interest in programming and robotics from people of all ages is enormous. So we thought, why not design an adorable new robot that lets people of all ages enjoy robotics, while offering them a wide range of possibilities, and - most of all - is fun?Sparki works out of the box with its remote control. To write your own programs, just plug it in via USB, install the custom-enhanced Arduino software and try any of the dozens of example programs. We have programs for every sensor and actuator on Sparki:Based on pilot-class testing of Sparki with middle school aged children, as well as extensive experience teaching Arduino classes to kids and adults alike, we’re developing complete tutorials and individual/classroom lesson plans for Sparki, all available for free (CC Attribution licensed).Here are some of the things you'll learn how to do:And more advanced concepts:Our goal at ArcBotics is to make robotics accessible and fun to everyone. We believe a robot for education to be a powerful idea with the potential to spread interest in programming, electronics, and other STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields to anyone. We have designed Sparki with parents, educators, and kids in mind, as well as DIY/robotic enthusiasts. We hope to 'spark' a revolution in educational robotics, lowering the barrier to entry and igniting a wave of hands-on learning.Joseph Schlesinger, Co-founder, CEO: Joseph leads the product development and manufacturing side of ArcBotics.

Kickstarter has a ""Updates"" section which sole purpose is to be used for keeping backers up to date!!    Kickstarter is where you backers found you, where your backers supported you and is the central place where all your backers have accounts!!~I just would like to say that I am disappointed in the professionalism that the team has shown with the lack of updates. Every update you have states dates that give the backers hope, however, we go weeks without any indication that things are on schedule. I do believe I speak for many people when I say that it does not take much effort to keep people in the loop for time frames and letting us know when things are not going to plan. If this company wishes to be viable things need to change. I am sorry to hear that your manufacturer shipped scratched equipment, but it would be nice to know that my money was not wasted on something that may not come to fruition when it could have gone to something that would be in my hands when promised. I am not doubting that you will get our products to us, but this does not make your business look good. I have kept quite because I know you have gotten many emails that say the same thing. I just hope that we do get a good product and that it is what we wanted but my hopes are at a all time low as of now.~Silence... not feeling golden to me today. Anyone can have issues and delays - but when I'm on the hook waiting for a promised product months after it was due, then I expect to at least be apprised of what's gone wrong, and what the current status is. Oh well, sadly, for many of the projects I've backed, the behavior is much the same. It's getting old.~Ok, here we are. The last update said ""Our current dates shipping from the factory to our US warehouses are the 15th and 20th"" It's now the 21st where I am - did this shipping occur?~Nevermind, my girlfriend wanted it for Christmas but here is a video of the Sparki in action using the remote if anyone wants to see it~If anyone wants one of the ""Right now"" sparki's in time for Christmas I have mine listed on eBay for what I paid. I lost interest in it once it was late and there was no libraries available for it (there are now).~ahh.. okay...thanks.. :)   getting closer.  :)~Okay, so its Wednesday (actually Thursday in China) and we're now officially past the ""middle"" of the week.   you said we'd get an update in the ""beginning"" of the week... would really appreciate an update on the finalized shipping dates.~Congratulations, I can only guess at your feelings and await with reat enthusiasm. please keep me on your next project mailing list.~Ok, so were almost done the 1st week in December and you said you'd know how close you were to maintaining the published schedule by now.

Any new cool manufacturing stuff happening with Sparki?~Hi Team ArcBotics,   Wanted to follow-up on my inquiry regarding the status of the ""Right Now"" level Sparkis.  Seems the query I thought was posted several days back either didn't transfer to this forum or was accidentally deleted.  My question was whether ArcBotics would be getting out all the Sparkis slated for June delivery before your team moved to China.  If not, when is the anticipated date of shipping?  Your last update indicated you were pulling these Sparki together for shipment.  Thanks for your reply & good luck in China!~Looking forward to seeing Sparki in the mail!~We are so excited !! This will be a present for our son - he has no idea it is coming.

I had to figure it out for my tanks. As most of them are 1/2 inch thick glass and had to update my pledge also.~Thank you for your help in determining what version of MOAI I need to order, I've since updated my pledge. I'm very excited for this project :)~Hello, I have a quick question about the cleaning pads. Do you know how long they'd last? If they do need replacing, where could they be sourced from? Thanks!~@David the moai will fit a tank that is 9mm (3/8) - 14mm (9/16) and the moai plus will fit a tank that is 15mm (9/16) - 20mm (13/16). 40 gallon tanks are normally about a 1/4 in thick glass.

Why was the design changed from the round version to this oblong version where the camera was set in the center and this is set to one side and the cleaning pad on the other one looked bigger?~For how many gallons is this good for?Also, I'm not sure I understand what's the difference between the normal and the plus version... Thanks!~Hi MOAI,thanks for the fast and positive reply. That sounds good!~Hi, i'm a backer. Why is the max length of the Aquarium really limited?! I mean, this gadet dont make sense for small tanks, due to its size itself. But why is there, especially on the MOAI Plus, a limited tank size of 2m? I mean, this gadget makes especially sense on big tanks and i guess a lot of people have longer tanks than two meters, especially when you have a glass thickness of 20mm. Why is it limitet and is it maybe possible to expand its working range? Maybe via software, a stronger transmitter or maybe a range extender/dockingstation on the other corner of the tank. I hope you can find a solution for that, that would make the product a lot more interesting and useful. Nevertheless its seems to be a nice and reasoned product, except the limited range.~",0.0,"$30,000",MOAI：Robot for Your Aquarium by MOAI — Kickstarter

Attach Sesame to your existing lock. (This only takes a few seconds. Really.)3. That’s it! Celebrate your new, key-free life. Sesame doesn't even need to be exactly at the center of your lock or at any specific angle. It just works with your lock perfectly.We're doing what others think is impossible. There’s no need to replace or remove anything. No screwdrivers, no hammers, not even an allen wrench.Sesame makes magic happen.Have a weird lock? No problem. Our five-patented design works with just about any single cylinder deadbolt in the world.* For instance, the transforming picture shown below shows more than a dozen of the typical locks in North America. Sesame can perfectly work on these even though they are quite different from each other. *Current model is optimized for US/ Canada/ Denmark/ Sweden/ Norway/ Singapore/ Malaysia Markets but also works for Japanese deadbolts. See more at Update#1 & Update#2. Connect Sesame to the Internet with a WiFi Access Point.The optional WiFi access point connects Sesame to the Internet without further draining the batteries.The Wi-Fi Access Point runs open source OpenWrt Linux and uses 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n WiFi and a Bluetooth LE 4.0 radio. It’s fully compatible with Arduino IDE v1.5.4 or later -- the ideal choice to connect your Bluetooth devices to your home/mesh Wi-Fi network.Sesame, probably the lightest ""smart"" lock ever designed (5.7 oz / 161 g with two batteries) is super robust on the door. According to 3M, the 3M Command Large double-sided tape has a weight capacity‎ of 5 pounds‎ (2268 g), which is nearly 15 times of Sesame's weight. Never worry that Sesame will fall off. Simply tape Sesame to your door with a single strip of 3M Command tape (supplied), which won't leave a trace when removed [Video].From the first to the fifth generation, we are dedicated to making Sesame smaller, smarter and stronger.CANDY HOUSE Inc. brings you ingenuity directly out of Stanford University. It was founded in 2014 by Jerming Gu (CHE-MING KU, from Taiwan) and Jongho Shin (from Korea), together with their best friends Wei-ting Kuo, Bou-chen Kuo, and Wen-hang Su.Adam Lisagor, FLUX 3D Printer, Yuqing Pan, Gary Chang, Sungjune Jang(장성준), Leonard Pak, Wanting Huang, Liam Kane-Grade, Chenhao Zhu and Sugino Mako.

Has been working great and I am really happy with my sesame now (remote access has come in super handy!) It's been a long road but overall I must say I am happy with the product.~Still waiting for my wifi module. This is getting past a joke. Does anyone know when the wifi modules are being sent?~Finally Sesame is sending me the whole set of the Sesame Lock + the WiFi module. Now DHL just called and say I need to pay custom fees of abt USD50 and I need to apply Sirim license (for the WiFi unit) now to get it approved before I received the entire package. I’m not sure if I need to pay anything extra for the Sirim license yet. Any Malaysian gone thru this stage with custom and dealing it with DHL?~Hi! I emailed candyhouse regarding the status of my wifi module a few weeks ago. I didn't want to spam the inbox with another email so I figured I try here just in case.  Hope to hear back soon and everything is well with you all.~it's been three years since I backed this project, at the highest level, and i still HAVEN'T received the wifi module. what's going on?~Waiting for my WIFI adapter as well, any ETA?Also waiting for my extra cover and batteries, had to buy new batteries recently too =(~After update, wi-fi module is working! Thanks candyhouse!!~Shipped WiFi module does not work~Still anxiously waiting for my Wifi adapter and Apple's Homekit support.  Any new updates?~Still haven't received anything yet...~Still waiting...~I still didn't receive my product !!!!!! What the hell ?~I can't believe they launched an IGG campaign without giving me my product I backed in 2015 first.~hey, I went to google and in one of the conversations about linking, I was able tounlink and then link again.  Yes Yes Yes .. I can now check my lock status via google assistant.Paul~Has anyone connected or linked google assistant to sesame lock?When I asked how to do it, sesame response was to connect me to a documents page that has no link to link or unlink~Im very disappointed with Sesame and especially their founders. I backed Sesame in 2015 and just in 2017 they tried to ship me the product. But what happened is that I never received Sesame. Candy House (founder of Sesame) informed to customs different price that I had paid and then the customs of Brazil destroyed my product after some time. I NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT THAT I HELPED TO FOUND.~Wow.... My sesame has been in a drawer because it's a piece of crap that won't open my door properly and burns through batteries like crazy even when I don't use it for weeks and haven't gotten my WiFi access point either and I see you have the sesame 2018 that was released on indigogo. I'm super not impressed and will make sure to let people know it.~I don’t have smartthings, I have google and sesame lock which cannot connect to each other even though sesame says they can.. so sad~@PaulYamada: To get it on the Apple Watch, you need Smartthings. Add Sesame to Smartthings going here: https://community.candyhouse.co/t/sesame-smartthings-integration/1046. One you do that, you can create an ""Open Door"" routine and a ""Close Door"" routine on Smartthings which will then appear on the Smartthings Apple Watch App.~Where is My WiFi access point.  ?~PS how do you get sesame on your Apple Watch?~An honest review: I was backer 14 of this project. I will have to say that I never thought that I would get the full product much less actually like the product. I've had the Sesame for almost 2 years. The product works consistently on iOS and has actually been extremely useful. I received the WiFi module with the extra batteries and cover about a month ago. Instructions for the module would have been nice, but I got it up and running in about 10 minutes after searching online. The Wifi module has been consistent and even hooks up with my Smartthings to give it more capabilities (e.g., I get a notification if the door is unlocked for more than 2 hrs and able to use my AppleWatch to open the door). I know there are a lot of people that complain on the comments, and I don't know if I've just gotten lucky that I've had very little issues with the Sesame and Wifi modules. However, what I thought was going to be a wasted $140, ended up being a really nice (albeit not very attractive comparatively to August). I can't believe I am actually saying this almost 3 year after making my initial pledge: I congratulate Candy House on delivering a working product.~When did the WiFi Access point ship?I have been waiting forever..When can I expect to receive mine ?~I tried google assistant to check the lock status and it says Sesame is not responding plug Auto Unlock no longer works nor does knocking.. I guess I should have expected it~Hey I hope you enjoyed the trip to Texas on our dime. Where is my wify thingy?~Startup of the year for a three year overdue campaign?! Wow, scraping the barrel much?~Did not get mine either. Please advise what steps to take to get my pledged product.~Never got mine...~Worst. Campaign. Ever.~Give me back my money. Did sent you video 3 month ago, still no refund, still no fucking item. Fucking scammers ...~has anyone installed this on a square lock? my lock knob is square and is too big for the included adapter. does anyone have any 3D print files?~Wait, Wifi access points have shipped.  When can i expect mine?~And not via email~Why has my Sesame stopped working? What’s the point of getting another Wi-Fi AP if I don’t have a working Sesame? Why do address this question here and via email?~You thinking that that was 50 feet, it now makes more sense why none of these products work~The video I sent you is with the wifi AP at 11 feet from the Sesame... I’ve also tried it with the door open which puts it at less than 5 feet 😕~I haven't received my WI-Fi access point yet!! What the hell!!~It’s not to far. Stop with your whoops bullshit. I’ve tried it from less than 5 feet away. Now from trying to make my Wi-Fi AP work it has caused my Sesame to stop working all together. I SPENT THREE HOURS LOCKED OUT OF MY HOUSE LAST NIGHT BECAUSE OF YOUR SORRY EXCUSE FOR A PRODUCT!!! This company is a SCAM!!!~Who wants to road trip to San Jose and throw their non working Sesame and Wi-Fi AP in the faces of these pathetic excuses for human beings?~This company is a complete joke and so is their product! After sending me a non-operational Wi-Fi access point, saying I didn’t know how to set it up correctly the Sesame has now completely bricked itself and will not operate at all. I’m currently locked out of my house in the rain waiting for my brother to get in town to bring me a spare key. These people are so incompetent and have wasted hours, going on days of my time. 😠😡🤬~Received my covers, batteries & APs.  But of course, no power for the APs.  Pretty much defeats the purpose... you want me to plug it into my laptops USB port?  I've written to you many times, mentioned it numerous times on here.  Without a power adapter these things are useless.  Most people don't have USB outlets in their walls.  And it's not like we have extra USB power adapters laying around... and even the 2 I do have are different specs than listed on the AP.~I have my WiFi adapter connected and working.

23,"  Twitter - Facebook - InstagrammimicArm is a programmable collaborative A.I. robot. Using a building block approach to teaching, users will learn complex robotics programming in a gradual frustration-free way. As soon as it's constructed mimicArm works in manual mode and can execute pre-programmed example programs. Thanks to the intuitive nature of mimicArm, children as young as five can start using mimicArm right away. When the user is ready to start programming on their own mimicBlock offers a simple drag-and-drop programming environment. More complex programs can be written in C to perform more complex robotic tasks. Learn more about mimicArm here. There are plenty of educational robots out there, but mimicArm is the only true k-12+ robot available. No other educational robot combines the simplicity required for young students with the capability required for more experienced users.As a programmable A.I. collaborative robot (or cobot), mimicArm is a fun way to learn robotics and the foundations of programming robot/human interactions, robot decision making, and machine learning. mimicArm is fun and engaging from the very start. As soon as mimicArm is assembled the user can start using mimicArm in manual mode. Adding the scribbleBot attachment is even more fun. Users can post their projects and get advice in our forum at fabric8r.com.When the user is ready to start programming, pre-programmed examples ensure that users are able to start fast. The mimicBlock graphical programming language makes it easy for kids to load and alter programs from our website or write programs of their own. (You can download mimicBlock BETA now to see how it works). mimicBlock is similar to other programming curricula commonly used in classrooms and STEAM camps across the world, so it makes a great complement to other tools the user might be using. After learning the basics in mimicBlock more advanced programs can be written in C. These examples get pretty sophisticated, and you can learn more about them here.In manual mode mimicArm uses our patent pending Posi-Feel(tm) technology (learn more), which gives the user intuitive haptic feedback and allows sophisticated delicate manipulation not possible on other servo based robots.  This not only provides intuitive feel, reducing operator frustration, but also allows the user to manipulate a variety of objects, from strong and heavy to very fragile. The inputBox (included in our Deluxe kit) comes pre-programmed to allow the user to use different inputs to interact with mimicArm right away.  As the user learns to program mimicArm to perform ever more complex tasks they can develop a unique personality for their mimicArm based on the programming choices they make. There are other robots designed to teach programming, but only mimicArm is uniquely designed to teach interaction between robot and human. Through its unique design and combinations of sensors mimicArm is able to sense it's environment in such a way as to understand what a human is asking it to do. At the simplest, mimicArm can tell if it has grabbed a block it's been offered, while at it's most complex mimicArm is able to detect and reach for blocks, sort by size, communicate it's status, and receive instructions through a microphone or button.  It's a great choice for everyone from robot novice to veteran programmer. Never programmed before? No problem! When you're ready, our simple yet powerful programming software gradually eases you into programming concepts and our downloadable experiments start simple to guide you every step of the way. The mimicArm circuit board takes care of the tough control system tasks so the user can program with simple intuitive commands like robotMove or robotGrab. The experiments incrementally increase in complexity until you're able to program using genuine C code just like the professionals, and your mimicArm becomes a genuine collaborative robot, capable of making decisions and learning. Want to pick up delicate objects without breaking them? mimicArm can do that. Want to record and playback a dance? mimicArm can do that. Need a shop assistant to hold your soldering iron? mimicArm can do that too. Add our available accessories and even more possibilities emerge. mimicArm is the only k-12 educational robot available. mimicArm leverages the popular Arduino microcontrollers and programming environment for nearly infinite expandability as the user’s abilities grow. Want to make mimicArm remote controlled? Use the remote included in our inputBox! Want to record and playback your motions? Use the inputBox microSD card! Want mimicArm to detect and move blocks? Use our IR Distance Sensor! Check out our Experiments Page for examples. Using these capabilities you can take mimicArm from a simple manually controlled robot all the way to an artificial intelligence machine capable of decision making and human interaction.All of our mimicArm kits allow the user to get started in manual mode as soon as they’re assembled, come pre-programmed with simple A.I. examples, and are programmable. mimicArm kits are designed for easy assembly. Using the included wrench, screwdriver, and hex key you can fully assembl your mimicArm in a couple of hours. (Younger users will need an adult’s help).

24," As seen on...Share this campaign with your friends and family!*The Bluetooth Module is a custom designed breakout board of the HM-10 by my friend [Ladvien] on LetsMakeRobots.com. This particular board uses BLE (or Bluetooth Low Energy) and as such may not be compatible with all devices.PopPet is different from many other robotics platforms as she is packed full of personality. PopPet is an ‘Arduino at Heart’ robot which means she can be programmed using the Arduino IDE.The key feature with PopPet is to change her to suit you. You can change the look of PopPet with interchangeable face plates and LED holes (located on the top and bottom plates). Would you like PopPet to look like an animal? You can do that! (More faceplates are currently in design and will be shown as the campaign progresses)What is the use of playing with a highly customizable and unique robot kit if you can't do any of your own customizing? Well, that is one of the main reasons why PopPet will be an Open Source Hardware robot. The design plans will be released to allow you to make your own custom face plates, add-ons, wheels or whatever else you can think of. Not everyone has access to a laser cutter, so there will also be slightly modified files available to fit the tolerances found on most 3D printers. There are many mounting points for various sensors all over PopPet. There are places to mount several line following modules, LED's, LDR's and even a piezo buzzer. There are also many places to zip strap things onto, because I know how important zip-straps are in robot building.Often robot chassis are big and bulky making them difficult to transport, not PopPet! PopPet is just ever so slightly larger than a credit card!For two years I have been making robot video tutorials and posting them on my YouTube channel. One of the questions I get asked most is ""What robot kit I should buy?"" I could never really answer that question. So I got to work on designing my dream robot kit and I came up with PopPet.PopPet’s ‘body’ was based off of a robot I made some time before called PET. There were two things that I really liked about PET, the look and size of her. As I designed PopPet it was these two features that she had to have.Having made two basic robots for them, I got a lot of feedback about which bits were hard, which bits were easy and which bits were just boring. Taking their feedback I designed a robot kit that eliminated all the boring bits whilst still offering a considerable challenge in terms of construction.Out of the box PopPet is pre-loaded with a basic obstacle avoidance routine as follows:And with the STANDARD kit there will also be sketches available on PopPet's website for the following:But you can quite easily expand PopPet's capabilities with more sensors as included in the ADVANCED KIT. PopPet is a test bed, a means to expand and learn. There will be lots of example sketches and tasks available on the website in the near future but I encourage you to think of what you want your PopPet to do.
Well no one is forcing you to! But PopPet is great for people of all ages and skill levels. Those new to the world of robotics will enjoy the ‘out of box’ experience and ease of construction. Veterans of the hobbyist robotics world will enjoy the expandability that is available with PopPet. This Kickstarter campaign is about so much more than PopPet though. It’s about bringing the world of robotics to households around the world, educating and inspiring the next generation of engineers and makers.
Whilst PopPet does look great on the outside, it’s what’s in the inside that counts. In terms of actuation PopPet uses two Little Black Duck DC Motors. These LBD’s come in a servo form factor making them very easy to mount. They are quite quick and come with handy female jumper cable connectors. To ‘see’ PopPet uses the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor. Using this sensor essentially means PopPet ‘sees’ just like a bat. It sends out an ultrasonic wave using one ‘eye’ and waits for it to return on the other. When this wave is heard we can calculate how far away an object is by using a simple mathematical formula. For the ‘brains’ PopPet uses the DAGU Mini Driver. This is a great board as it has a small form factor and has an on-board H-bridge. Having an H-Bridge on-board means we can control two DC motors without any additionally circuitry. For power PopPet uses four AAA batteries. This allows for a more than adequate run time, but there is space to put your own four AA battery pack, doing this though means it needs to be mounted on the outside. NOTE: The batteries are not included in this kit and will need to be bought separately.Dupont cables are included in order to connect the HC-SR04 to the Mini Driver.Bits and pieces (these are the parts used in the prototype and may change in the final version):This campaign is not just about raising the funds to
bring PopPet into production, it’s about creating a potentially long line of
products that will come as a result in the future. The goal is set at 8k in order to cover the costs of production for PopPet, purchase new equipment to continue robotics kit development, pay the fees taken out by Kickstarter and Banks and still have some left in case costs are larger than quoted.PopPet is in the final prototype stages. The Kickstarter funds will be used to finalize the design and then make orders for the parts. The final prototype is not that much different from that pictured, only the mounting options will be slightly different as I've had time to see what is, and is not useful.
This is based on my current 'one man team' situation with an approximate 100 backer orders. Others have expressed their interest to help, but I have not factored that in. If the amount of orders are larger than this however, packaging times will increase obviously.I have also taken the maximum time periods for all and added a week or two on for good measure, this gives some breathing room. I would prefer to overestimate the time periods then underestimate.If hiccups do occur in the stated time periods then you will be notified. But please, even though the estimated arrival time is around Christmas, do not purchase as a Christmas present. I would hate a hiccup in shipping estimations to ruin a Christmas.Well, it's not really a team, It's just me. But I like to say 'we' because I like to think that those who support me are part of the team. Also, some people might join the team if the campaign is successful.So who am I? I'm Jaidyn Edwards. I'm 19 years old and an avid robot maker. I bought an Arduino two years ago and have been making contraptions with it ever since. I've been making robot video tutorials on YouTube for a year now and love every minute of it. I now have 7.5K subscribers and over half a million views! I started my life long dream University degree of Mechatronic Engineering but had to leave. I didn't let that stop me though.

25," We reached our first stretch goal! But we still want to help schools!Thanks so much for backing our project. We are thrilled to announce that you have enabled us to reach our goal of $50,000 and our stretch goal of 65,000. Every KIBO purchased through our Kickstarter campaign will come with a KIBO Project Guide with fun ideas to share with your children. We are still trying to reach our second stretch goal. If we get  $80,000 by June 29 we will start a fund for schools that need help affording their KIBOs. We’ll publish letters from these schools on our website so you can share the excitement of getting KIBOs to more kids. What is KIBO?KIBO is a robot kit specifically designed for young children aged 4-7 years old. It is different from any other kit out there because it appeals to both technically minded kids and those that connect more to arts and culture or physical activity. Young children learn by doing. Children build their own robot with KIBO, program it to do what they want, and decorate it. KIBO gives children the chance to make their ideas physical and tangible—exactly what their young minds and bodies need. And KIBO does all this without requiring screen time from PCs, tablets or smartphones. 
Designed for open-ended play, KIBO lets children make almost anything - a character from a story, a carousel, a dancer, a race helicopter - anything that they can think of. The child creates a sequence of instructions (a program) using the wooden KIBO blocks. They scan the blocks with the KIBO body to tell the robot what to do. They press the button and the robot comes alive. With KIBO, young children can become programmers, engineers, designers, artists, dancers, choreographers and writers. 

And unlike other activity kits out there, KIBO is based on over 15 years of research in learning technologies and child development at a world-renowned educational research institution, including testing with over 300 children and 50 teachers.WHAT DO CHILDREN LEARN WITH KIBO?Coding (or programming) is a new kind of literacy. But it exercises mental muscles that are useful for many other activities and skills.

When playing with KIBO, young children learn programming ideas that are directly related to foundational concepts in math, literacy, science and humanities. These include sequencing, modularity, cause-and-effect, and patterns. Research shows that sequencing is foundational for academic success, for math and literacy development, as well as for executive function.

Furthermore, children engage in habits of mind such as: design process when they iteratively develop and test an idea; problem solving when their KIBO programs don’t work the way they want; and executive functions when they plan and execute their projects with different kinds of constraints such as time, resources or materials.
WHY PROGRAMMING ROBOTS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN?Young children love to make things, and they love to make things that move and respond to their commands. Robotics brings together atoms and bits - the physical world and computational world. Robotics is a natural fit for young children’s interests and curiosities. 

Research shows that young children will learn programming and engineering at a very early age if they are given tools that are developmentally appropriate. Research also shows that children are most open to new ways of thinking about themselves when they are under the age of eight. So to ensure that their self-image includes enjoyment, understanding and competence in working with technology, it is best to expose them to it while they are open to soaking it up. That way they will grow up to have skills that give them both improved employment opportunities and a healthy outlet for self-expression.

Furthermore, research shows that from an economic and a developmental standpoint, educational programs that begin in early childhood are associated with lower costs and more durable effects than interventions that begin later on. Research also shows that introducing STEM (Science, Technology Engineering and Math) in early childhood might help to avoid stereotypes. However, one of the major impediments for bringing technology and engineering into early childhood education is the lack of developmentally appropriate technologies. KIBO addresses this need.
WHY IS KIBO DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN?KIBO is designed on a firm understanding of the cognitive, social, emotional and motor abilities and needs of young children.

With KIBO young children can program without a PC screen, tablet or mobile phone. Children play with KIBO using their hands to manipulate wooden blocks with pictures of programming instructions.

 Programs made of wooden blocks are tangible, so they can be shared easily. They can be talked about and debugged in a social circle. Wooden programming blocks are naturally familiar and comfortable for children, in the tradition of learning manipulatives already used in early childhood classrooms to teach shapes, size and colors. 

Most research-based robotic construction kits are designed for older children. They come out of labs or universities with a focus on engineering and computer science. In contrast, KIBO was specifically designed for young children KIBO is based on over 15 years of research, funded by the National Science Foundation by Prof. Marina Umaschi Bers and her DevTech research group at Tufts University’s Eliot Pearson Department of Child Development.Research was done with approximately 40 early childhood teachers and 300 young children in many classrooms to understand how to best design a robot kit for young children and to evaluate learning outcomes. The resulting research prototype was called  KIWI, develop curriculum that allows them to integrate robotics with other content areas in their teaching. Investigations were done with parents to learn what they want for their young children and what they need as supporting materials for their homes. WHO IS MAKING KIBO?KIBO's life started as the KIWI research prototype at the DevTech research group at Tufts University, directed by Marina Umaschi Bers, professor
of Child Development and Computer Science. She dreamt with a robotic kit that her three young children could play with.  Over the years Marina's DevTech research group received generous financial support from the National Science Foundation. Lots of prototypes were hand-built and used in many classrooms, from Pre-K to 2nd grade. However, Marina grew frustrated because she was often asked by parents and teachers: ""How can I get a KIWI robot kit?"" For many years she did not have a good answer because KIWIs were only hand-build prototypes. She knew that in order to make a technology commercially available for a wider audience, a different set of skills was needed.

During a walk at Walden Pond, near Boston, her friend Mitch Rosenberg, veteran executive at several robotics start-ups, decided to join Marina to pursue a long-time dream of his: improving STEM education. Together, Marina and Mitch founded  KinderLab Robotics, Inc, with the goal of making critical technology and engineering skills fun to learn for young children.KinderLab Robotics recently received initial funding from the National Science Foundation through an SBIR Phase I grant to explore the needed steps to take KIWI out of the lab and into the real world. However, to commercialize KIBO, KinderLab now needs to raise money to equip a manufacturing facility plus seed inventory for its first commercial-scale production run. WHO FOUNDED KINDERLAB ROBOTICS?Marina Umaschi Bers is a professor at Tufts University where she directs the DevTech research group, and she is chief scientist at KinderLab Robotics, Inc. She brings 20 years of research experience designing and evaluating learning technologies for children and pedagogical approaches that take advantage of programming and engineering to promote positive youth development. Besides the KIWI robotic prototype, she most recently  co-developed the ScratchJr programming language with Mitch Resnick from the MIT Media Lab and Paula Bonta from PICO.

KIBO was inspired by the wonderful family of robotic construction environments for children designed and developed with Seymour Papert’s Constructionist philosophy of education. Remember the first turtle of the LOGO programming language back in the 70’s? It was not on the screen- it was a physical robot that would move around the floor. Many years have passed since then, but the vision is still alive. We are lucky that today there are many flavors and choices of different robotic learning environments for children. KIBO makes its contribution by addressing an audience that was left behind but is particularly important: young children between 4 and 7 years. WHAT IS OUR PRODUCTION PLAN ? We have developed and tested three different generations of the KIWI prototype with children and teachers at Tufts University. After comparing notes and analyzing pros and cons, we decided on a final version. We built over 60 KIWI prototypes and tested them extensively. Based on those results, we licensed the technology and we are making the KIBO product. All mechanical and electrical designs are completed. Molds and circuit boards are being manufactured in China. All of the wood components as well as product assembly and testing will be done in the US. It will be a very busy summer in Arlington, MA! We have a strong team and we are confident that we will make our deadline. Our goal is to have the first manufacturing run of 1,000 KIBOs all assembled by loving hands. Exceeding our funding target will mean being able to have a second run and possibly bring the cost down.Check us out at http://www.kinderlabrobotics.comWHAT DO PARENTS SAY ?WHAT DO YOUNG KIDS SAY ?WHAT DO TEACHERS SAY ?","KinderLab Robotics, Inc","$78,539",Unstated,Making thinking tangible by programming robots in early childhood,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,346 ," Hi Marina and Mitch,~",0.0,"$50,000","KIBO: Young kids programming robots with wooden blocks by KinderLab Robotics, Inc — Kickstarter"

 We will also be releasing 3 new panels, which all backers who purchased $195 and over will receive! The new panels include a Music Reverse panel and Key and Door panels. The Music Reverse panel will play the sound panels placed before it in reverse. The Key and Door panels will add a new challenge by requiring the robot to obtain a “key” before it reaches a “door” to pass. Please click on here for more deatails. KUMIITA is an educational toy designed for 0 to 3 year olds to teach them the concepts of programming. By providing a language-less and hands-on experience in the form of a puzzle game, children can become accustomed to programming from a young age. KUMIITA cultivates the basic thinking patterns and logic behind programming in children by allowing them to physically assemble command panels and see how the resulting programs are executed - and why they fail at times, as well. Failed programs can also be fixed by rearranging the panels in various ways, allowing children to figure out new solutions for themselves.    KUMIITA was created to realize the CEO Toshi’s vision of a “prosperous future through technology” by providing children with opportunities to become familiar with programming so that they could be future programmers, or to use their knowledge and concepts of programming as a tool to better their future.        Using programming fundamentals like these to configure the panels, there are so many possibilities with KUMIITA to notch up the difficulty level. Even children over three (and adults too!) will be sure to be edu-tained! The demo of the two outcomes of Question 1 (SWITCH)The Robot has successfully reached the goal, so it played the fanfare.   The Robot has failed to navigate itself to the goal, so it played the error sound with red LED.   You and your child's new coding robot buddy.

The robot is equipped with Grid Onput technology patented by GridMark Inc. This works with the pattern recognition scanner to sense a set of small dots printed on the command panels that act as a new generation 2D bar code. The KUMIITA robot recognizes the dots and executes the associated command. *Please note that the specifications above are subject to change during development.Panel Size: 120 mm x 120 mm x 2.5 mm (4.7 in x 4.7 in x 0.1 in)Weight: 34 g (1 oz)Panel Technology:The panels are printed with Grid Onput dots on the surface. The Grid Onput dot codes store 48 bits (max. 108 bits) of information. The scanner on the robot will recognize a 2 mm x 2 mm (0.07 in x 0.07 in ) area as one set of code and can distinguish over 300 billion different codes. The robot recognizes them as an ID, XY coordinates and also uses them to distinguish the angle of rotation. Carbon ink that absorbs infrared radiation and transparent IR absorbing ink is used to print the dot code patterns. The graphics are printed on top of the IR absorbing layer making the dots invisible to the human eye, so image quality is not affected.*Please note that the specifications above are subject to change during development. By expanding the variety of command panels in the future, we hope to further inspire children by representing the endless possibilities of programming.              KUMIITA is an independent project by distinguished creators brought together by Toshi's vision to realize a prosperous future through technology. Our designer, Hiro, has won numerous international awards home appliance design, and is an experience crowdfunder including work on the design of VIE SHAIR, which collected over $170,000 through Kickstarter. 
 
 Nobu, our engineer, is a professional in the field of networking together software and hardware systems. He was head of engineering for the VIE SHAIR project, working together with Hiro. 
 
 Tomo is in charge of mass production and is a multi-player who helped with the software and hardware design, manufacture, and mass production. He is also active as our office manager. After the project began in earnest in November 2016, we have overcome a number of issues, including improving the accuracy of the pattern code recognition technology. It was only a staggering six months that we were able to launch the product, as each member worked to bring Toshi's vision together.   We have already verified the operation on the prototype, but to put our product into mass production, we need $30,000 for die and manufacturing costs.

27," Tertill is a solar-powered and weatherproof robot that weeds your garden every day.With Tertill, gardeners can now enjoy weed-free vegetable and flower gardens, without the monotony and frustration of weeding.  Organic gardeners can breathe easy and enjoy a weed-free, chemical-free garden all season long.Created by roboticist Joe Jones – inventor of the Roomba – Franklin Robotics’ Tertill is designed to live in your garden and take care of the weeding, come rain or shine.Tertill lives in your garden and prevents weeds from becoming established.  Using unique design elements and a variety of sensors, Tertill patrols the garden daily, avoiding plants and obstacles while looking for weeds to eliminate.Tertill has a very simple method: weeds are short, plants are tall. A plant tall enough to touch the front of Tertill's shell activates a sensor that makes the robot turn away. A plant short enough to pass under Tertill’s shell, though, activates a different sensor that turns on the weed cutter.  Because Tertill's approach is height-based, put one of the provided plant collars around short plants until they are tall enough for Tertill to recognize. When Tertill approaches the collar, it will recognize it and turn away.Tertill whacks weeds using a spinning string trimmer, which cuts the weed off near the ground.  Because Tertill lives in your garden and goes looking for weeds every day, weeds are always small when the robot finds them.

A whacked weed may sprout again, but sprouting takes energy stored in the seed or root.  By coming back every day, Tertill never lets a weed develop the leaves it needs to replenish this energy, so eventually the weed gives up and dies.Tertill gets its power from the sun.  When there is sunlight—even on cloudy days—Tertill’s solar cell converts the light into electricity.  The robot stores the energy in a battery.  You don’t need to charge or replace Tertill’s battery.
Tertill uses its stored power smartly—during cloudy stretches, when less power is available, it patrols for weeds less often.  Tertill is more aggressive during periods with more sun.  Fortunately, weeds grow more slowly when they have less light.Most gardeners will need only one robot.  If you have an unusually large garden (good for you!) you might get better performance with more than one robot.  (The area of a typical garden in the US is about 100 square feet.)Tertill uses four-wheel-drive.  This helps Tertill move through soft soil, sand, and mulch, and also helps Tertill climb slopes.  Its distinctive diagonal wheels make Tertill more stable on slopes and help it get past certain terrain challenges.Tertill relies on several sensors and clever programming to keep out of trouble.  To detect objects like the garden fence and big plants, Tertill uses sensors similar to those found in many smart phones—the lightest touch is all it takes.  To detect steep slopes, Tertill uses the same sort of sensor that tells your cell phone which way is up.  Tertill can also sense if a motor stops turning—perhaps jammed by a rock—so it can protect itself from damage.There needs to be at least a short barrier around your garden to keep Tertill from wandering away. The barrier might be a fence, edging that’s two inches or taller, or the wooden border of a raised bed.Tertill has a simple, reliable strategy to ensure that it covers the garden.  It uses a combination of bouncing away from, and sometimes following, obstacles and plants.  This is the same strategy employed by some models of Roomba and other robotic vacuums.Using a robot to weed your garden has some important advantages.No herbicides: Gardeners with persistent weed problems sometimes resort to chemical herbicides to protect their crops. But by patiently chopping weeds when they are small, Tertill keeps weeds well controlled using only mechanical means. The expense, the hassle, the danger to children and pets, and the worries associated with chemical herbicides are eliminated.  (Have you ever actually read what you're supposed to do with herbicides?  There's a lot to it.) Diligence: Gardeners often forget to weed but weeds never forget to grow. At one time or another most of us have been dismayed to find a once pristine garden “suddenly” choked with weeds. We all intend to give our gardens regular attention but sometimes life gets in the way. Not so for Tertill. Tertill’s only purpose is weeding, so it never forgets, never gets distracted, and never goes on vacation.Productivity: All the fertilizer, all the water, and all the sunlight that reaches your garden should go to growing healthy, productive crops. But weeds use these resources, too, depriving them of the light and food they need to thrive. By keeping the weeds from establishing themselves, Tertill makes sure that your plants (the good ones!) get all the resources they can.Gardening limitations: Gardening offers great benefit to the gardener. It gives us time outdoors surrounded by growing plants, it’s good exercise, it rewards us with delicious, fresh food, and it is a source of pride and accomplishment. But older folks or anyone with a mobility challenge may find that their physical limitations force them to cut back on gardening. Tertill can help. Because weeding is often the most arduous gardening job, assigning that task to a robot can help the gardener keep doing what they love.Robotic Awesomeness: People have been trying to get weeds out of their garden for a long time: they have tried plastic groundcloth, homemade herbicides, boiling water, and countless other approaches.  But all of these remedies lack a certain robotic awesomeness that Tertill brings to the situation.We have come a long way since the Lego and Wiffle ball prototype that first ran in Joe's garden.  After building and testing 6 generations of prototypes, we are nearly ready to set up manufacturing to get Tertill delivered as soon as possible.We have come to Kickstarter so that we can place a large enough order to produce the robots cost-effectively.  In return, you will be one of the first to receive a weeding robot for your garden.Our team is experienced in designing, building, and marketing consumer products, and has a deep experience in robots, particularly in AgTech or agriculture technology. We’d like to say thanks to our followers who have helped shape Tertill, and to our friends and families that have supported us.  Your ideas, feedback, and support have allowed us to make this idea real, and we’re excited to be on this journey.If you can, please help us spread the word.

In my mail was a very small parcel. My Tiddlybot. I naturally, documented my assembly process after reading notes a few times. I only needed to loosen Raspberry Pi A+ mounting screws 1x because it wasn't clear in steps to mount IR Line following sensor to base plate before securing the Pi. Also, it wasn't clear what the included rubber tubing was for (not in drawing) but I deduced they were for covering wheels...rubber tires for traction. another note about attaching Camera to servo... servo may not be ""homed"" so after initial power up, you may need to reorientate camera on mount to be centered in travel. After a few hours, the battery was charged. Very pleased with my Tiddlybot...time to learn SCRATCH and make another copy of SD image supplied. I prefer to soft shutdown my Pi's when done with activitites...so I needed to SSH into Tiddlybot and sudo shutdown -h now before powering off....just my preference.

I've since dug around and see that you've just changed the design to use a different Pi variant. This isn't indicated at all in the campaign page, is not in any email and even reading through some of the updates, it is just mentioned that it will be an option. This was never offered to me. A bit disappointing that now I need to go an purchase something else in order to make this work.

Your support will help fund an awesome robot and more importantly, the development of future engineers!As a quick note, we had some unexpected delays in starting up the account so this Kickstarter will go until after the Regional competition -- we'll still have bills to pay and hopefully a World Championship to plan for!FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) isn't just about creating a robot though. Dean Kamen, founder of FIRST and inventor of, among many other technological advances, the Segway, wanted to get kids as excited about math and science as they are about sports. Sometimes called the ""Varsity Sport for the Mind,"" FIRST reaches students of all ages, from elementary to high school. This is a sport where ""everyone can go pro!"" So what do FIRST students really learn?Got all that? In other words, FIRST Robotics students are getting hands-on experience that will give us a ""kickstart"" for college and beyond! We can't express how much your support will not only help our team in the present but also our students in the future. Enough context, time to tell you about this year's project! The 2013 FRC game, Ultimate Ascent, involves shooting frisbees and climbing steel pyramids on a 27' by 54' field. We have six weeks to build a robot that will be able to compete in this challenge as well as work in an alliance with two others teams and their robots. So where will your money go? Your donation will go towards various parts, materials, and tools for building the robot. There is also a $5,000 registration fee for the FIRST Robotics Competition. Last but not least, we'd like to thank all of our parents, dedicated mentors, and sponsors because without their help, we wouldn't be able to build a robot every year!

32," At Fathom, we're a group of outdoor enthusiasts, scuba divers, filmmakers, and tech nerds who are passionate about underwater exploration. To share that passion with others, we developed the Fathom One—an HD underwater drone that’s easy to use, highly portable, and fully modular, all for under $600. That's less than half the price of its closest competition.Here are just a few of Fathom One's features:   Ease of use is something we obsess over at Fathom. You can build the most capable product in the world, but unless everyone can easily pick it up and use it, it's not worth much in our eyes. That's why we promise you'll be able to become a pro at piloting the Fathom One the first time you take it out. It's simple, but it's also versatile. At the heart of the Fathom One lies its modular thruster attachment system. All three of the Fathom One's thrusters (two on the sides + one on the rear) clip on and off, allowing you to easily customize, upgrade, or pack your device. This also means you don't have to limit yourself to the thrusters we provide. If you want to develop custom thrust modules, go ahead and design them for a completely unique experience. We plan to roll out an entire line of thrusters and accessories, but we know the real innovation happens when you, the explorer, build your own.The Fathom One also features an integrated rail system that allows you to attach action cameras, extra lights, and additional sensors with ease. We can't wait to see some of the setups you create using our platform as a foundation. No matter what the application, the Fathom One can be tailored to fit your needs.   Fathom One comes with a 100-foot line that tethers it to a custom floating buoy, allowing for easy retrieval. Our buoy creates its own WiFi network, enabling wireless piloting and live HD video streaming to any Android or iOS smart device via our app within a 100 foot radius. That's down to 100 feet deep from up to 100 feet away, standard.Additionally, the Fathom One’s onboard battery enables up to one full hour of run time on a single charge, helped by the underwater drone’s ability to suspend itself with neutral buoyancy (unlike aerial drones which need much more power to hover). Simply connect the provided power cable to the drone’s tether port and plug it in to recharge.  The battery is non-removable, ensuring the Fathom One's water-tight seal isn't compromised by swapping batteries. One of the best parts of using the Fathom One is sharing what you see with your friends. Simply record and upload your underwater footage to social media using the Fathom app so no matter where you go, your friends won't miss out on the action.We also realize that many of you may prefer using a physical controller (rather than touchscreen piloting via the Fathom mobile app), which is why our app enables integration of Bluetooth gaming controllers to provide a high precision piloting experience.
With thrusters removed, the Fathom One's hull measures only 8'' x 6'' x 4'', making it the most portable underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the world. Easily pack it in a backpack for a day hike, or tuck it in a carry-on to take on vacation. By removing the thrusters, there's nothing to snag or break in transit.   Although we plan to offer special carrying cases in the near future, the Fathom One is designed to be thrown in bags you already have, making it easier than ever to transport your drone. Its small size also means you have more room for the things you need for your expedition, whether that's a day on the boat or a trek through the Amazon.If you're still not sold on the Fathom One's portability, check out this handy comparison chart to put things in perspective: Because Fathom One is so customizable, it can be used for just about any application you can imagine. Here are just a few ideas to get you inspired:
 We knew from the beginning that we wanted to make an underwater drone that anyone could afford. That's why — after two years of research and development — we're proud to announce the full retail price of a Fathom One drone will be $599. Because of this, the Fathom One sets a new standard in bang for your buck. Here's how we did it:A Streamlined Design - Something we noticed over and over was that every consumer ROV on the market today is completely over-engineered for the average individual. We give you the ability to add the accessories you want without paying for them in the base unit if you don't want or need them.A New Manufacturing Process - We designed the Fathom One drone to be incredibly simple to manufacture and assemble, cutting down on labor costs associated with the device. Re-engineered Components - To ensure we deliver an extremely reliable yet inexpensive product, we've ditched the hobbyist components and developed our own. This means that everything that goes into the Fathom One has been optimized for reliability and underwater performance. We need your help to bring underwater exploration to the masses, so here are a variety of rewards to choose from when you back the Fathom One:
Stay in the Loop ($1) - Stay up to date on the latest happenings at Fathom. You'll get exclusive newsletter and backer updates, first-hand news about product discounts, and a big thank you from the Fathom team. Fathom T-Shirt ($25) - Just because we're a high tech brand doesn't mean we have bad style. For $25 you can choose between a timeless classic - the basic logo tee - or our limited edition ""Embrace the Deep"" tee. No matter which you pick, you'll be looking good. Super Early Bird Fathom One ($399) - Includes a Fathom One underwater drone, WiFi buoy, and 100 feet of tether for $200 below retail price. (Limit 200 backers)Early Bird Fathom One ($499) - Includes a Fathom One underwater drone, WiFi buoy, and 100 feet of tether for $100 below retail price. (Limit 200 Backers)The Fathom One ($599) - Includes a Fathom One underwater drone, WiFi buoy, and 100 feet of tether. Buddy Set ($1,099) - Buddy Set backers will receive two Fathom One drones, two WiFi buoys, and two 100 foot spools of tether for $100 off retail price. Trust us when we say that underwater exploration is incredibly fun, but it's even better with a friend. Fathom One Swarm ($2,499) - This tier is for those that intend to do some serious exploring. For less than you can purchase one of our competitor's units, you can have five Fathom One drone sets for $500 off retail. With five drones investigating the same area, you won't miss much. Putting your trust in us is a big step. We know that. So let us introduce ourselves, the co-founders of Fathom.     John Boss (Center) - John is the lead designer of the Fathom One. For two years he's dedicated himself to making underwater exploration easier than ever. With a degree in biomechanical engineering, he has years of experience as a scuba diver, boater, STEM education advocate, and entrepreneur. John brings a unique skill set to the team, helping bridge the gap between product innovation and business development. 
 
 Danny Vessells (Left) - Danny heads up marketing and customer outreach at Fathom. After coming up with the original concept for the Fathom One, he brought John and Matt on board to help make his dream a reality. To effectively market such a unique product, he combines his creative and analytical skill set to create promotional material that truly separates Fathom from the competition. He also plays a key role in developing partnerships that will help the company grow in the future. Matt Gira (Right) - Matt is a jack of all trades when it comes to entrepreneurship. He handles business development, financials, partnerships, and operations. Whatever it is with Fathom, Matt knows what's going on. He finds ways to improve the business before we even get there, helping to prepare us for the future. Because we know we can't go it alone, we've aligned ourselves with world-class partners to bring the Fathom One to life:                                                  Edgewater Automation and Development - With a focus on electro-mechanical devices, Edgewater Development’s team specializes in taking ideas from concept to market as well as improving process and products. Their ability to build and test prototypes, alpha and beta test units, and start-up production lines enables them to provide solutions specific to our needs. Edgewater engineers also have specific experience building deep-ocean ROVs, as well as having experience on projects like the Deep Flight Super Falcon. GR Current Xcelerate Program - We knew we could build a great product, but to be successful on Kickstarter, we knew we also had to have a rock-solid business model. The crew at GR Current helped us take a fledgling idea and turn it into a sustainable business. Without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. We live on a planet that’s 71% water, yet we’ve only explored 10% of it. That’s why we created the Fathom One — to make underwater exploration accessible and affordable for everyone. We're so excited that we have the opportunity to share the Fathom One with you, the Kickstarter community, to help us make this dream a reality.Thank you for your support!

Each lesson plan will include example programs, Edison tasks and student challenges – some individual and others team based. A special version of EdWare for Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a very capable small computer which can be used for electronics projects and costs approximately $50. Now that really is low cost robotics! EdWare iOS and Android apps. Program Edison using either an iPad or Android tablet, using the supplied EdComm cable, that plugs into the headphone socket. These EdWare apps will be FREE to download. Mobile AND low cost robotics is about to become a reality!Edison is for students of all ages and also for both beginner and experienced hobbyists. You can buy a single robot for under $40 and learn computer programming just like other robotics systems which can cost much, much more. Edison is a great resource for teachers as classroom sets are now very affordable for schools - it's now possible to have one robot per student. Edison is modular and LEGO®  compatible. He provides a scalable way to build any size robotic invention.Edison is the perfect teaching and learning robot for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) activities!We’ve packed Edison full of an amazing features and
functionality. Edison has:Edison can:EdWare is a fun way to start learning computer programming.This simple ‘drag and drop’ graphical programming language uses CONTROL, READ, DATA and FLOW instructions that are linked together in a logical ’flowchart’ style. Advanced programming is just a mouse click away – up to 1000 command icons can be used in a single program. Sophisticated programs using 16-bit maths and event interrupts can also control one Edison, or several Edisons operating together.EdWare is a free open source program that runs on Mac, Linux and Windows computers.You can download EdWare from www.meetedison.com. To upload your program to Edison, the supplied EdComm data cable is simply connected between your computer’s headphone jack and Edison. Then press PLAY and let Edison do the rest!EdComm uses audio encoded data to transfer your program to Edison. This happens via your computer’s headphone socket, so no additional driver software is required to be installed.If you want to learn more about how to control Edison – download the EdWare beta and try for yourself at www.meetedison.com/downloads - it’s really easy to install, but you’ll need an Edison to run the program.Edison has been designed, as not only a stand-alone robot, but also as a modular robotics system that is easily expandable using LEGO® bricks. Two or more Edisons can be connected together. For example you can create a bulldozer, where the bottom Edison becomes the wheel driving mechanism and the top Edison controls the bucket tipper. New inventions are only limited by your own imagination!If you want to know even more about 'what makes Edison tick' here's some of his technical specifications:Edison has already progressed a long way from our original product concept to detailed CAD models and physical prototypes. We are now working hard to 'get him across the finish line'.Once we complete our Kickstarter campaign it is 'full speed ahead’ for shipping your Edison to you by December - anywhere in the world.

I'm going to carry it around in my backpack with me :)~I still have not received my edison :( (Portugal)~I would love to know if you have some kind of registry of people that pledged and who you sent stuff to (maybe mailing tracking numbers?), because I did pledge, and paid, and so far I have NO idea if anything is going my way or not.~Haha mind already open and play. my nephew can't wait lol~Arrived today. Did a quick test with one of them before packing them for under the tree and it works wonderful... can't wait to explore these with my son on Christmas ;-)~I got mind yesterday look very nice :) (US)~Just wanted to let you know that after the delay in shipping the Edisons did arrive before Christmas.  Actually they came the same day as the visit from my grandsons so perfect timing.  They loved them.  Thank you for the assistance getting them moving  and thanks for a great little robot~Got mine today!  Holy Cow, these are awesome.  I've been playing with it all afternoon and I absolutely LOVE it!.  I got 3 but I'm going to buy more because they are so inexpensive but work so well I want to give them to all my friends who have kids.  It's so easy for them to jump in and program, and using the audio output to program it was the best thing, no drivers to mess with, although I do see some people are having some issues, I was fortunate, I didn't have any problems.  Can't wait for the Mac version of EdWare and the iOS version.~Same as some here, my Edison is marked ""left Hong Kong"" since 12 - 06 but no news since. I really hope it'll come soon but I'm not so confident :/~My two Edisons arrived today! Here's a short video with one of them programmed for line following and the other to be 'caged-in' by black lines. Enjoy :-) http://www.youtube.com/watch…~Thanks Nick.  I don't have a printer handy, so I wasn't able to print them out to try.  I tried to have the Edison drive across the barcode on my LCD screen, but that didn't seem to work either.  Will have to wait until next weekend.~To J Dubrow and others with ""erratic Edisons""~And about 6 hours after my last comment, two bright orange Edison boxes arrived by courier! Looking forward to seeing the kids' faces on Xmas morn! Thanks Microbric.. If you know of a place in Adelaide I can find that Lego Technic excavator kit in the next 3 days I'd be even more grateful!! :)~The Hongkong post page just shows my package shipped for Australia on December 8, but no other detail/progress info.  Really hoping it arrives before Xmas!~Hi. Edison is very nice!I can't yet download program to Edison by Edware 0.9.7.3.But I succeeded download indirectly. 1)Record download-sound in PC. 2)Mail sound file to iPhone. 3)Connect cable and play sound and download to Edison. I'm waiting new Edware and firmware. (I hope Edison can download by putting Edison on Edware window without the cable.)~Hi. Received mine yesterday in Singapore. Just nice for Xmas. Cheers.~I just received mine and followed the instructions included, but it drives forward a little, backward, then turns and forward, then backward, turns, ....repeats...over and over on a wide open surface and bumps into my hand when I put it in front of it, even though the instructions say it will drive and avoid obstacles.~Nice to see people getting it :) can't wait to get mind but my tracking # shipped date is Dec 30th.~Just received our 2 Edisons (The Netherlands), exaclty one day before our Chrismas leave. My son was very afraid they would not arrive on time, but is now very happy he can take them with him for full exploration during the holdiays.~Hello Sebastian,I have the same problem as you. I see the following message on the page of Hongkong Post (http://app3.hongkongpost.hk/CGI/mt/enquiry.jsp): ""The item (...) arrived at Germany on 12-Dec-2014."" It looks like, that the german customs officers joined the Amazon strike and are much more successful than the Amazon workers.~Is there anybody from Germany that has already received his/her Edison(s)? My tracking reads ""has arrived in Germany december, 12th"" and I'm afraid that it's stuck at the german customs? German Post says that it might take up to five (5?!) weeks. Thought I ... *whoops* ... I mean my kids could play with it under the christmas tree... ;)~Just got it in US. I am on Linux/Mac. Is there an eta for the Linux or Mac version?Is it still open source so we can tinker with it?How does the cable transmit the program (just curious)? I sent a wave file to the cable. But I did not see any light patterns.Thanks great job for early shipping.~Hi folks, just to let you know that the 3 Edisons arrived yesterday here in the UK. I also arranged for an A1 laminated print of the Edmat to be printed by a web based print company. The Edison I tested works fine on the Edmat with the bar codes but having some issues with the PC software which Brenton and his team are addressing and I'm sure will be fixed in the next day or two. The build quality is excellent and the packaging fine with all 3 arriving with no damage. Looking forward to software update and really giving these little gems a work out. Nick~The ""edison"" arrived (Melbourne, Australia) via registered mail !!! Very nice packing. Just in time for Christmas ... little one will be happy! Looks well manufactured. Looking forward putting it to a test soon ... :-)~When I checked shipping details this morning it seems to be out of whatever problem it was in and is on its way....Yea!   Thanks for you help in getting it moving.~Where can I check the status of my shipment?~Thanks for check on this for me... I know me and the boys are hoping they get here before Christmas ... fingers crossed.~@Brenton, thanks for the explanation and action. Best, Mark...~@cabo, I had exactly the same shipment status - however, my Edison's are destined for the UK. I contacted Brenton and he said he would look into it, which I imagine he has as the shipment status now says 'being processed for departure from Hong Kong'. Still no idea what had occurred to the original shipment though...~",0.0,"AU$ 20,000",Edison - fun robotics for tomorrow's inventors! by Microbric — Kickstarter
34," Did you miss our Kickstarter campaign and want to support Team USA, or do you just want more swag? Click here to visit our online store and buy merch after we ship our rewards to backers!We are MegaBots, Inc. We challenged Japan to a giant robot duel, and they accepted... but demanded that the fight include hand-to-hand combat. We say BRING IT ON. We've assembled an incredible team of patriots to help us upgrade the Mk.II into the robot America deserves in the world's first giant robot fight, but we need your support to help pay for those upgrades!Right now, the existing Mk.II tops out at 2.5 mph and is built for long-range paintball combat. That means it has thin, destructible armor plates and a mesh canopy. The entire robot's built to be 'lightweight' (if you can call 12,000 pounds light), and hand-to-hand fighting is a whole new level of combat.In order for the Mk.II to survive hand-to-hand combat, we need toThat basic upgrade will cost $500,000. In order to make sure we win the fight, we need to:All told, a fully upgraded Mk.II will cost $1,500,000. Team USA needs your help now, in order to win this fight. Pledge today to make sure your team takes home the trophy!$500,000: Melee Combat Capability, High Performance Track BaseMeeting our $500,000 goal means that we get to seriously overhaul the Mk.II. We'll build the ridiculously cool weapon systems you see in our concept art, add the shock-mounted steel armor we need to survive multi-ton punches, beef up our hydraulic actuators to handle the additional weight of our armor and weapons, upgrade our power unit to provide 5x the horsepower to handle the additional power demands of our new hydraulic system, and then work with Howe & Howe Technologies to build a custom track base replacement that'll make us 5x faster than we are now - which will end up making us 2x faster than KURATAS!$750,000: Modular Melee & Ranged Weapon OptionsRaising $750,000 will allow us to design and build an array of melee and ranged weapon systems options to help us find the perfect load-out to beat KURATAS. This kind of fight has never happened in real life before - what works at this scale, and what doesn't? This level will help us answer that question. This assortment potentially includes, but isn't limited to, crushing and grasping claws, pile drivers, shields, pneumatically-driven fists, cannons of all shapes and sizes, and flamethrowers (just in case).$1,000,000: Dynamic Balancing AlgorithmAt the end of the day, both the Mk.II and KURATAS are top-heavy. We can practice driving and punching carefully to make sure we don't fall, but right now both robots run the risk of tipping over if they punch or get punched too hard. Raising $1,000,000 will allow us to work with IHMC Robotics, the top-placed U.S. team in the DARPA Humanoid Robotics Challenge, to develop a custom high-end balance control system for the Mk.II so that we can stay upright no matter what happens. This system could EASILY make the difference between falling over after the first punch, and staying upright through the entire match.$1,250,000: Life Safety SystemsRaising $1,250,000 will allow us to engage with NASA - the leaders in the field of keeping humans safe in extreme environments - to see how NASA life safety systems might be used in the cockpit of the Mk.II. We need make sure we can fight as aggressively as possible while also not blacking out from impacts. Safety 4th, folks.$1,500,000: Hollywood-Grade Paint JobRaising $1,500,000 will allow us to work with FonCo Creative Services to create a Hollywood-grade artistic look and feel to the robot's armor panels. This is America's first giant combat robot - it deserves to look like the million bucks it actually costs!$5: Website Shout-outFirst and foremost, you get to tell all your friends that you did your patriotic duty to make sure that America snatches the title of World's Best Giant Robot Builders from the hands of the Japanese. How's that for a reward? For $5 we'll put your name on our website as an online memorial to your awesomeness.$10: Behind-the-Scenes Media Content and Sticker For $10, we'll set you up with a sweet MegaBots logo sticker to feed your vandalism habit, in addition to the shout-out.

We like to create innovation. We dream about exploring other planets.NASA and ESA plan to send another rover to Mars in 2020. Spacex wants to send one million people to Mars in the next 100 years. However, before anyone sends a rover to another planet, we designed Turtle — a robot to remind you about how beautiful the Earth is. We're passionate travelers and engineers.Since 2013, we have been engaged in building analog mars rovers. We participated in other projects, e.g. FREDE - sending research equipment into the stratosphere, organized by the German, Swedish, and European Space Agencies. We also supported and manufactured parts for DREAM Project - a project that sent an experiment in a rocket to drill in microgravity conditions. Now we are ready to take this experience to another level! We build Turtle Rover as a 100% customizable open platform to make it useful in many different fields.We want people to explore the world with it and to learn engineering. We believe it's the future.Coming back to our roots, we also want Turtle to help analog astronauts practice during their missions!

Versatile, abundant upgrades, customizable commands, pre-assembled or self-assembly.MAKE: “Ai.Frame caught my eye because of all the cool moves the robots do, although turning around becomes a surprisingly difficult option for a walking robot.”Robots play a big part in our lives. They are toys in your childhood, they are heros in the movie, they are assembling-arms in the factories, they are helping with medical procedures in the hospitals... 

 For us, robots are childhood mermories, filled with sounds of joy and laughter as well as expressions of curiosity and amazement.

We at Ai.Frame team want to share our experiences with you through our products, for us inventing robots is fun, it's passion, filled with endless possibilities. 

 There are many great robotic inventions on the market, but in the meantime, for most people, they are too expensive,($5000 or more, open-source ones are even more expensive), they are less personalized, they are too difficult to assemble and control.

 We wanted to give everyone something different.

 That's why we started this project: Ai.Frame in 2012.Affordable, Personalized, Simple and just plain Awesome.
The Ai.Frame is an open-source miniature humanoid robot.  It is versatile, it has abundant upgrades, customizable commands, both pre-assembled and self-assembly available. It is powered by smart servos and sophisticated sensors.

The Ai.Frame Apollo's skeleton contains 109 pieces and its outer shell contains 12, while the Ai.Frame Rex consists of 98 pieces. We also made made a concerted effort to optimize the molding and screws for the strongest possible structure. Nonetheless, you can choose to either build an Ai.Frame from scratch or to have us assemble it for you.You can purchase pre-assembled set or you can enjoy fun of self-assembly.Sensor: Thinking for Itself With its sophisticated sensors, the Ai.Frame comes with all the interactive features you could want in a humanoid robot. Both prototypes are compatible with the sensors and boards in the smart bundle. Additional sensors can also be added or further upgraded. Why we love Open Source Hardware?We are the Ai.Frame team, Jiaqi Hu and Zebo Sun. We both graduated from the Harbin Institute of Technology in China and majored in mechanical and electronic engineering. As passionate makers, we’ve been receiving awards for our inventions since our school years, including model planes and model windmill generators.A technology startup event in Shanghai brought us together for a collaboration in 2010. Our first collaborative invention, a delivery drone called “Linkall” (http://linkall.me), received a lot of media attention in China in 2011.Our backgrounds in engineering and shared passion for cool anime sparked the basic idea for the Ai.Frame Robot in 2012. We usually collaborate on every task, because while one of us is more artistic in making cool design and envisioning features, and the other is better at computing and actualizing ideas.

(Often attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.)There are many excellent robot products that aim to teach children to code. Those robots build the ship. We see the curiosity-driven play of bots_alive to be the prior step: building a passion in children for the human-centered design, technology, engineering, and math that drives the robots.          We create the world around these robots. We can make it easy for them... or difficult. We craft mazes and obstacles courses. The robots try to solve them with unusually organic behavior. One bots_alive smartphone kit gives life to 1 or 2 Hexbug® Spiders. Teach your bot. Improve its skills.           Our goal is to make robots whose behavior appears alive more than any machine you’ve interacted with.bots_alive robots hesitate, look around curiously, and make mistakes. They're unpredictable.All of this comes from a new category of character artificial intelligence that we’re pioneering. It started at the MIT Media Lab in research by founder Brad Knox. We describe in depth in the FAQ at the end.  Computer vision for augmented reality:Hold the phone. Or prop it up and play below. Both iOS and Android are supported.      It's easy to set up.  Suggested pledge levels and rewards:When we reach $50,000, sumo wrestling between 2 robots is unlocked.       We've built this product with kids 6 and up in mind. We play-tested the robots shortly before the campaign.Our young testers built mazes, obstacle courses, and even towers. Then they sat back and watched the robot attempt their challenge.The robot's organic behavior rewards the kids for their designs, since the robot appears to struggle, falter, and sometimes succeed at the tasks. Kids cite the robots' unpredictability and expressivity as a key reason why building challenges are so much fun. What do kids do in these play tests? See for yourself:Our companion app controls the robots, but we designed bots_alive for kids to focus on the real world. The screen is just a reference to occasionally check. We've also seen the robots promote group play.We expect to learn a lot from you and other supporters during this Kickstarter campaign.

I wish you luck on this campaign and hope you get no more unexpected surprises.~Hi Brad! How are things going? We all still on schedule for delivery?~Great idea for the box.  I would think straight down view is best but sounds like something just above horizontal works? Unless the box is 36"" �~Update coming soon I hope.  Always interested on how a project gets launched.~Great article.  This appears to be a new concept in AI making more human in appearance.  What is actually being used in the videos with the hexbots demonstrations since the project is  still in development phase.  Currently autonomus control of some sort or more human guided puppeteer control.  Thanks~Brad - hope to generate some more discussion with the group.  I think this is an amazing project, like having a little Mars rover controlled by the phone.  Still curious on 2 things.1)  Learning mode, your video mentions this too.  Can you provide an update some day on what this does.2)  Still like to understand running the same routine multiple times.  Will the Hexbot run the same routine each time?  If different their is decision processes in play, or just random - but that still seems like a decision to me.~I thought the group would be interested in your input.  Does the Hexbot learn from its trials.  If presented with the same obstacles multiple times, is the result random or does it improve its path?  Also is the app complete at this time or in development?  Thanks~Just checking in.....~Just checking back in on how things are going.~Close to an update?  Hopefully Hexbots have not taken over the office.~Congratulations and well done!~Congratulations.  Good luck with the next phase of the project.~Hi Brad,just a question from your latest backer..Does the add-on pack exists of red and blue or only red blocks?Good luck with the awaiting fathership!~Brad, did Amazon come through? If so, any luck with the Battle Spiders?

40," The Hummingbird Duo may be the first electronics kit that is fun and educational for a fourth grader, a high school student, a college engineering student, or an adult maker. We have designed several levels of learning into the Hummingbird experience. Instead of a steep learning curve, learners go up a staircase where each step increases skills and where mastering each step allows one to use the Hummingbird in a new and more interesting way.The Parents' Choice Gold Award-winning version one Hummingbird robotics kit, released in 2012, featured a controller that operated as a tethered I/O board that allowed one to write programs that control motors, LEDs, and sensor data. The Hummingbird Duo is essentially two boards in one: It operates as either an original Hummingbird controller or as an Arduino Leonardo with an integrated motor/servo shield and improved connectors. We have often referred to our version one Hummingbird as a ""pre-Arduino"" because using it helps build skills and confidence that make it easier to use Arduino. With the Hummingbird Duo, we've built the Arduino right into the controller, so that anyone who wants to can immediately take that next step! The Duo controller will be the core of all new Hummingbird kits. The kits will include various additional components as well: motors, servos, vibration motors, LEDs, and sensors. All kit components are soldered with 24"" braided wires and terminate in bare, tinned wire to prevent wire fraying. Securely connecting them to the Duo controller is easy due to Duo's clear labels and spring-loaded terminal blocks. Depending on the type of kit (see rewards), components may include:Part of the fun of building a robot with the Hummingbird kit is that we are building material agnostic: use anything you have lying around! The kit comes with no included building materials, although we have seen robots built out of the boxes that our version one kits are shipped in!Hummingbird originated with the Arts & Bots project in the Carnegie Mellon CREATE Lab, and perhaps owing to this influence, most of the robots built with the version one kit are made of arts & crafts supplies and/or recyclable materials. Craft materials are familiar and beloved by virtually all kids, and kids know how to build with them. Craft projects are also common in elementary or middle school, making it easier to integrate Hummingbird into core subjects like history or science! Part of Hummingbird's mission is to explode common conceptions of how robotics can be used in K-12 education. Here's just one example of an arts & crafts project made with a Hummingbird version one kit, a robotic interpretation of the children's book Bunnicula:Check out the Arts & Bots blog for hundreds of other examples!Hummingbird supports programming environments that range from very easy to get started with to advanced and powerful. Everything is free, open source, and runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux:CREATE Lab Visual Programmer. The CREATE Lab visual programmer is the original way to program the Hummingbird: it was designed as part of the same research program, Arts & Bots, that led to the development of Hummingbird. The Visual Programmer employs a novel storyboarding concept to programming robots that is fast to learn while still allowing programming of complicated robot behaviors. Scratch 2.0 and Snap!. Scratch is a tile-based visual programming language developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at MIT. It is an excellent first programming environment for children. Snap! retains' Scratch's look and feel, but adds higher level computer science concepts; it is even used in UC Berkeley's Beauty and Joy of Computing course! We provide software that allows Hummingbird to work with these two great environments.Arduino IDE. Download code to the Duo and unplug it from the computer! You can optionally use our Hummingbird library for Arduino to simplify using standard kit components in Arduino programs.There are more advanced ways to use Hummingbird Duo as well. In tethered mode, we provide Java and Python APIs, for Windows/Mac/Linux and Raspberry Pi! Or you could write your own firmware for Hummingbird Duo in AVR GCC. There are four reward levels that include a Hummingbird Duo controller:Here's exactly what gets included with every kit:You can also support our efforts in other ways. For as little as $5, we will add your name (if desired) to our wall of backers, to be hosted at http://www.hummingbirdkit.com/backers. This page will be linked from the Hummingbird Kit's homepage.For $25 or more, you get an awesome Hummingbird T-shirt, with a big, bright orange robot Hummingbird on a royal blue shirt. Kid and adult sizes available.Finally, for $6,000 we will travel to your location and do a full day training workshop with up to 20 participants. Every participant will receive a base kit to keep that they will use over the course of the day to build and program a robot. We have run training workshops with Hummingbird for two years to tremendous success. We frequently receive feedback like ""I am a 55 year old art teacher and I was extremely skeptical going in that I would make anything. I can not believe that I designed, built, and programmed my first robot today!"" Check out this video from an educator training workshop to see the kinds of robots that can be built in just a few hours:Pixy Integration - Unlock at $50,000Pixy is a camera combined with an integrated vision processor, allowing it to easily recognize purple dinosaurs and other objects. We happily backed their Kickstarter campaign, and already have Pixy working with our prototype Hummingbird Duo in Arduino mode. With a little extra funding, we'll be able to do the software development required to get Pixy working as a sensor in the CREATE Lab Visual Programmer, Scratch 2.0, and Snap! so you'll be able to program robots that react to objects and colors with drag and drop programming environments.Fun fact: Pixy and Hummingbird both originated from research conducted at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute!3D Printable Parts - Unlock at $90,000We want to give you a reason to use that 3D printer you bought for your Makeshop or basement! We'll create and open source designs for:We will release the source CAD files so that you can use our designs as starting points for your own.20 Curricular Resources - Unlock at $150,000We are building a resource sharing site that should go live over the summer to allow educators to share awesome curricular modules. With added funding, we can incentivize some of the existing star teachers using the current kit to document their Hummingbird projects and share them on this site before the Hummingbird Duo ship date. The projects profiled in our Kickstarter video are a tiny tip of a very large iceberg! The projects will cover use from 4th grade to high school, and will align with state standards where appropriate. Exciting New Sensor Pack - Unlock at $250,000We have prototype sensors that measure humidity, barometric pressure, acceleration, and remote temperature. At $250,000, we will be able to fund the creation of the initial inventory for these sensors and will have them for sale by December.The Hummingbird Duo is an excellent kit for introducing electronics, robotics, engineering, and programming in any environment: at home, in the classroom, in summer camp, or in a club. That said, we are passionate about integrating Hummingbird with classroom education, for two reasons:We are focused on two major goals this year: Launching Hummingbird Duo, and improving our support for classroom use. To this end, we have several projects this year that are aimed specifically at assisting teachers with integrating Hummingbird with classroom education:We recognize that K-12 education doesn't turn on a dime: There are standards to be aligned to, administrators to be persuaded, budgets to be approved. Even when the stars align, it is often best for students and teachers for Hummingbird use to be limited in the first year - with a single project in one or two subjects. Our professional development, curricula, and documentation are designed to help, but we recognize that actual classroom use is the best way for teachers to discover how Hummingbird fits. We're not worried; nearly all the teachers we know who have used Hummingbird version one kits report finding new and more uses for the kits year over year; and many give glowing reviews. As a company, we are bootstrapped, profitable, growing, and have no debts. We are in this for the long haul.Our goal is for all students to learn some computer science and engineering as part of the regular school day. In addition to our products, we directly support this goal in the following ways:Since 2012, we have pledged 1% of our net profits to the Computer Science Teacher's Association. We believe in the work of the CSTA, which supports and promotes the teaching of computer science by providing resources, standards, professional development, and research.The Hummingboard Duo is an Arduino at Heart product. A percentage of every sale will go to Arduino to continue developing the tools and infrastructure that have allowed us and so many others to build awesome, empowering products.All of our software and hardware will be released under open source licenses, this includes:Hummingbird was developed as part of the Arts & Bots program at Carnegie Mellon's CREATE Lab. Arts & Bots (formerly Robot Diaries) development began in the summer of 2006 in a series of participatory design workshops with middle school girls. We set out to find a way to keep middle school girls engaged with robotics - at an age when many girls forego such activities - perceiving it as 'just for boys'. The Arts & Bots program has since expanded in scope and philosophy to include both boys and girls -  drawing upon students' interests in arts, crafts, communication, and storytelling while providing them with technical and design knowledge which enables them to build and utilize their own personal robots. Arts & Bots is currently engaged in a three year research program involving four universities and over a dozen primary and secondary schools to study the efficacy of using Hummingbird kits with K-12 students as part of the regular school day.The Hummingbird kit was initially developed for the Arts & Bots program in 2009, with 100 research beta units used from 2009-2011 initially in out-of-school environments, and later in middle school classes. The success of these programs coupled by requests from teachers and students for a commercial source of the kit led us to spin-off BirdBrain Technologies to produce and sell the version one Hummingbird kit in 2012. The version one Hummingbird kit has been adopted by hundreds of classrooms, and has also landed under many Christmas trees: in 2012 Fast Company declared it one of ""3 Gifts to get Girls Interested in Engineering"" and in 2014 we received the Parents' Choice Gold Award for best new toy. We were also recognized by the National School Board Association.That said, we are constantly striving to improve everything about Hummingbird: software, instructional materials, and the core hardware. The Hummingbird Duo includes many of the features requested by our core community of teachers: Tetherless operation, Arduino mode, and more minor improvements like wheels for motors, solid-ended leads, improved sound sensing, and color-coding of the connectors by function. We are extremely excited about its potential to empower positive classroom experiences and to grow with students as they learn.BirdBrain Technologies is a Pittsburgh, PA firm founded by Tom Lauwers in 2010 to commercialize educational technology developed by the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute’s CREATE lab. Our products include the Finch robot, a programmable robot for computer science education, and the Hummingbird robotics kit.We are a small team supported by researchers and software developers at the CREATE Lab and a strong team of consultants specializing in design, web development, curriculum, and professional development, as well as manufacturing and fulfillment contractors (both local and overseas). Tom LauwersPrior to starting the company, Tom was a Ph.D student in the CREATE lab at Carnegie Mellon University and was principal hardware engineer on the research projects that led to the Hummingbird Robotics Kit and to the Finch robot. His core competence is developing educational “gadgetry” to help students to create compelling, personal artifacts. In the process, students often accidentally learn engineering, computer science, math, and how to work together. Tom has a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, and an M.S. and Ph.D in Robotics, all from Carnegie Mellon University.We've done this before! We have existing relationships with suppliers who have helped us manufacture and ship over 3000 Hummingbird version one kits in the last 20 months. We know lead times for the various parts in the kit, and have also discussed with our suppliers how lead times vary based on volume in case we have a very large number of orders. That said, producing Hummingbird kits is a complicated operation, with parts sourced from all over the world.

 As Creoqode, our aim is to bridge the gap between hardware and software education. Prior to getting into coding, we want our users to understand the working principles and hardware fundamentals of a device by building it. A good balance between hardware and software knowledge provides a comprehensive understanding about devices. Nova has been developed with this ideology in mind, offering an exciting opportunity for users to improve their hardware and coding skills by building and programming an artificial intelligence robot.

But is there a way to buy two of these?  It would be great to use them in ""stereo"" and also see how they can be programmed to interact with each other.~Just bought one! ;) You guys rock! It's gorgeous! CONGRATULATION ! Bravo!~Greetings Creoqode team !~Dear Creator,~Thank you for the detailed answer. It will be great to find many useful tutorials on your page.Best regardsIvo~Hello Creoqode team, I have many questions. I am arduino beginner but I have basics and some coding experiences from different languages.Is possible to talk with Nova? Asking him simple questions and answered by him. If yes, is it possible in different languages like english? What I need for it?Can I connect him to internet with wifi extension and use him like security camera at home and control him from phone when I am not at home?What is memory size? What size of code I can load into him?How technically work face recognition? Can he identify exact persons from family?Do you plan offer mask in different colors and maybe shapes later? White or gray for example.What is the lifetime of servo motors in non-stop using?Your robot is beautiful art masterpiece.I always wanted to have a terminator head at home :-)~Congratulations! Funded project :)~Hi ho,~Hello.~Interesting. What is detailed specification built in Creo?~Is the camera in the right eye a cmucam5?  If not, what are its specs, like resolution, frames per second, etc.~Are you planning on using a pledge manager after the campaign is over? I'm asking because, as much as I love the idea of learning as much as I can about artificial intelligence, I am not sure if I can pledge over $AU 200 for this.~",0.0,"£20,000",NOVA | DIY Artificial Intelligence Robot by Creoqode — Kickstarter

Ben has offered to let anyone who wishes have his artwork etched there at that reward level. Enclosure updateThe video shows a plastic enclosure and the rewards promise a plastic enclosure but we have decided to go with laser cut plywood as you can see in the (new) project photo.The Back StoryDustin: Well, plan #357 for world domination has failed.David: I suspect our penchant for monologues is the culprit. What are we going to do with this stuff?Dustin: I dunno about the eels, but the Robotic Minion Starter Kit 
(Arduino compatible) boards are pretty cool. Maybe we could put them on Kickstarter as open source hardware.David: So we just put it out there to help other people get started?  People who actually have a shot at world domination? Nice.The Pitch Get your code out of your computer, off of your breadboard and into the real world where it can do your bidding.  The Robotic Minion Starter Kit helps you make cool stuff faster by providing a single-board solution with LCD, rotary encoder (think volume knob), and power regulator on the board, with software already written to do menu-driven user interfaces.  You can concentrate on solving the challenges unique to your problem.What is the Robotic Minion Starter Kit?The Robotic Minion Starter Kit is a small computer that includes an LCD, rotary encoder, and speaker, all housed in a plastic enclosure.  The kit gets people who are comfortable writing code a jumpstart on controlling hardware devices such as servo motors, LEDs, relays, etc, which in turn can control things like doors, lasers, cameras, music devices, remote control vehicles/robots, and just about anything else.  You can also interface with sensors the react to the environment such as GPS, proximity, temperature, acceleration, air pressure, or RFID.  It’s Arduino compatible which means you can leverage a large base of expertise and code that already exists.What's Arduino?Arduino is a hardware and software environment that allows Do It Yourself hobbyists to create devices that interact with the physical world in a variety of ways. Check out the Arduino Channel on Instructables for thousands of projects people have done. One personal favorite is the Chicken Coop Controller.I already love Arduino, or you convinced me I want to get into it. Why get a Robotic Minion Starter Kit?Arduino development boards like the Uno coupled with a bread board are great. You can prototype ideas quickly and figure out how to make your cool ideas work. However, you often end up with a great project that's difficult to deploy in the real world. The Robotic Minion Starter Kit is rugged and versatile. It's got the basics many projects need already on board with code examples that work out of the box. Would you recommend this for my first Arduino compatible?Yes, absolutely, this is great for beginners. You can play with the on board parts and display without buying any additional hardware other than a USB cable. If you are already a computer programmer you will be able to program this platform quickly to do interesting stuff.What do you mean by ""open source hardware""?http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/All the designs and are licensed with  the Creative Commons CC BY license. You aren't restricted in what you can do with the designs as long as you attribute the original creators.Phillipe Torrone has a great article on what it means to do open source hardware.

43," We're two engineers from MIT who think engineering is freakin' awesome and want to share that excitement with you. We've built the class we wish we had in high school and want to deliver it online to reach a diverse and international audience.We have spent the past few months building an online introduction to engineering course (for students in high school and up) combined with a  drawing robot arm kit and are now looking for you to join us in February 2014. By the end of two months, you will be able to explain the engineering mindset, source your future projects online, read sensors and control motors using microcontrollers in order to build your own creations, and meet dozens of peers online.This
 is an introduction to engineering course for 
students high-school aged and up. Prior programming/Arduino/electronics 
experience is not required.UPDATE: Stretch goal reached with 7 hours to go! Yay! Servos or stickers for everyone! We're really stoked and amazed, thanks everyone. Additionally, as the kickstarter ends and we still have 10 spots or so, please head over to narwhaledu.com if you wish to join in the class and it's before the last week of February 2014 (when the class starts).UPDATE: Funded! Our stretch goal is 20k, at which point we throw in extra stickers for everyone and an extra servo for course participants. Thanks so much everyone! Please keep spreading the word so we can get a full class of 100 students :)Note: Some of our in-person participants in the video / pictures are younger than high school, but we recommend the minimum age for our online course to be high school because we want the experience to be inspiring and not frustrating.What you getLearn engineering, build a drawing robot arm (in the first hour!), apply engineering to build something you dreamed up. Focus on the learning instead of buying supplies or piecing together documentation from around the internet.What we need100 students! That way we can produce the kits in volume, and also have a reasonably vibrant group of students.HackadayMake MagazineHackThings~~Kit:
 3 servos, 1 nano i/o shield, 1 microcontroller, 1 power supply, 2 
potentiometers, several lasercut enclosure pieces, 1 3d printed 
pen-holder, lots of nuts bolts and screws, 1 sharpie.Course: 2
 months (1 month to learn engineering with the kit, 1 month to apply 
those skills / kit components to build your own creation). 1st 
month: Estimated 3 hours/week, 12 hours total. Starts in February 2014. 
The course content will all be released at once and you can go through 
it at your own pace. We'll hold office hours on google hangouts at least
 once a week, more often depending on demand. We are using the EdX software platform.2nd month: Take apart the kit, build your own sweet robot creature with the components, show it off online and learn from each other.Course outline: (in more detail here)L1: IntroL2: Quickstart: Build and program a robot armL3: ProgrammingL4: Making Things MoveL5: Sensors~~What can I do with a robot arm?You can
 get it to programmatically draw narwhals! (provisionally not taught in the course -- depends on who signs up. Involves a bit of trigonometry, Canny edge 
detection):You can build copycat machines! (this is what you get to do in the first hour):You can get it to draw whatever you draw on the screen with a 
bit of Processing! (provisionally not taught in the course -- depends on who signs up.)(We'll
 release the source code for the interactive drawing and image 
processing when we get a chance, and we hope to run a course on it in 
the future -- or you can treat it as an exercise for the reader :])Why? 
Based on real-life tests (teaching students in-person this summer) we decided to start the introductory class 
with simpler code. (No trigonometry required!) The code is roughly like 
so: https://gist.github.com/nouyang/6943128. Don't worry, we'll explain it all!Why should I enroll [myself, my kid] in this course?Okay, so making robot arm doodles isn't enough to convince you. Here are some more reasons:1) Why study engineering? Good salary, build cool things, work on societal 
problems, shortage of people in STEM 
(Science/Technology/Engineering/Mathematics). We also want to show that 
engineering can be creative and empowering and fun. Yes, fun! See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msaWXY3OuQQ for dancing six-legged robots!2)
 Why take a class online? Your high school, like ours, may not have engineering 
classes. Or maybe they're all guys. We are creating the resources we 
wish we had in high school. Also, we hope that we can link people all 
around the world in our class.3) Why not (OWI, Mindstorms, ...) 
kit? We tried to create a complete curriculum with technical rigor and 
immediate practical life skills in problem-solving. This means that you 
don't have to source all the parts yourselves, you don't need 
engineering-minded parents, and you have the structure of a course to 
help you get started. We also designed our kit with the intention that 
people would want to take it apart and build their own thing. We don't want students to build it and then throw it in a closet, but rather to get addicted to building things.4) Why NarwhalEdu? We have experience assisting with classes at MIT and also running workshops with local students.Why does your course not cost $50 / why is the course worth $199?It's
 true that you could get three fully functional quadcopters for the cost
 of our course. This is because they produce tens of thousands of units.
 We just can't bring the cost down that far with 100 units. We also 
think $199 is a good deal for a two-month long course and drawing robot 
arm kit, and the parents we've talked to agree. We do care a lot about
 engineering education accessibility in terms of cost as well -- we just
 can't address that right off the bat. But with your support, in the 
future we can!Why would I take two months to learn engineering? I don't even get a badge at the end or anything.To make freakin' sweet things. Also to get jobs / internships / eternal salvation. (Okay, if everyone reallllly wants a badge, we may give them out :P)Also, working on projects can help you get into MIT. It's a trend!

 away at making the course! We're also making one final revision of the 
robot to standardize all the screws. We'll probably also test the class 
out on some unsuspecting friends of ours. Oh, right, and if this 
succeeds we will be buying lots of robot parts to put into kits.lasercutter kit production!Is this just another robot kit like Lego NXT?Nope!
 We don't want you to just build a sweet robot from kit pieces. We want 
you to know how to prototype and engineer as you would working at a

 possible.Why wouldn't i just wait a year until the course is released for free?You
 totally can! But by supporting us now, you can ensure that we'll still 
be in working on NarwhalEdu in a year, creating new and awesome classes 
and kits :)What is your plan for world domination?One
 robot per child! We want everyone to have access to the confidence and 
resources they need to get hooked on engineering and making things. This
 may mean designing other products for retail stores in the future, or 
building quadcopters if that turns out to be a better ""hook"" into 
engineering than drawing robots, or designing for the public school 
classroom.Why aren't you selling 1000 kits?This is

44," We're asking for your help to produce and test the ROBOTBOAT MARK VI.  Each robotboat is fully autonomous, needs no fuel, and will bring to bear myriad sensors at remote points on the surface of oceans, lakes, and rivers.  Think of it as a satellite for the seas.We need lots of low-cost self-propelled robots to study the health of the world's water.  Never send a person to do a buoy's job!  The real value of this technology lies at the fleet level, but given the extremely high performance required of each boat, purchasing even a few of them is simply beyond our means.  Building one boat represents a huge step towards cheap data.  Building more than one boat will allow us to test swarming algorithms, implement complex communication schemes, and take greater
 risks (e.g. undertake longer, more challenging missions).Bringing this opportunity to the kickstarter community will allow us to develop this technology MUCH FASTER than we could if we have to fund it
 ourselves;  the more resources we can raise here, the faster we can deliver.Perhaps Lilly Tomlin said it best: ""I said 'Somebody should do something about that.'  Then I realized I am somebody.""No matter where you stand on issues like climate change, marine conservation, offshore energy production etc., we hope you'll agree that everyone is better served by policies and behavior based on empirical scientific evidence.  We should all care about how we manage our water resources.We think Robotboat is the best way yet to generate information about the world's oceans.Walt, Rob, TJ, and Eamon...

Trust us, we've frozen our tootsies off while testing Robotboats enough to know that good gear is essential when people venture out on the water.  3D Printed Model:Think bathtub/desktop size...Special thanks to our international backers!  We'll have to ask you to help mitigate the extra shipping costs required to deliver your rewards.  For addresses outside the U.S.A. please add $8 for keychain / $15 for tshirt / $20 for 3D model / $35 for jacket to the appropriate rewards levels at right.Thanks for checking out the Robotboat!!!",Eamon Carrig,"$83,424",Unstated,We're building a fleet of autonomous sailing robots to study the oceans.

I don't think it's likely you'll reach the full $80,000 by October 12, but you've already gained over $50,000 in pledges, and it would be a real shame not to get that money - even if it isn't enough for your overall plan, it could certainly help you on your way.

You guys could really make a huge difference in the world!~I hope you guys make your goal! We need more data on the world around us before we mess it all up.~I've made a small pledge (and selected no reward) because I think this is a project worth doing.  I did have to give serious thought about whether to donate at all given that you are keeping the technology closed, but I think I understand your reasons.  ~Great idea, hope you guys get the funding you need. When you've done full test runs with Robotboat, you should start pitching it to marine companies - I'm willing to bet a lot of research, fishing and engineering firms would be willing to pay for a cheap, rugged data-gathering drone.~Would really like to build my own one of these...~This is actually pretty interesting, chipped in $5 just to know how it goes. In return, I hope you will use Kickstarter updates to, you know, update people.~Hey Eamon,~For what its worth, I support your position on keeping (at least some of) the technology closed until you are able to regain some of your resources.  I'm fascinated with this concept ... I'd like to see automated flying and ground bots too.  RocketBots for exploring the solar system would be cool as well.~Eamon,~For science!~Thanks for your comments Eamon.  Ultimately you have to decide what you are trying to achieve and what the best way is for you to get there.  However, I think when you seek funding from venture capitalists you will find that they will not be satisfied with access to your data, they will want access to your technology.  As a potential Kickstarter backer, I want the same.  Each potential backer will decide for themselves whether you are offering what they want.~This is an amazing idea and amazing technology, but if you're not open sourcing it what is the incentive for Kickstarter members to back you?  Some backers may be motivated to back you in the hope that you will collect some useful data, but you haven't said what data that will be or when you might collect it.  Opening up the technology would be much more valuable and would enable users to develop it further and collect their own data. Opening up the technology would also help it become widely adopted, which would create commercial opportunities for you in helping users implement it.~cool boat!~",0.0,"$80,000",Robotboat Mark VI by Eamon Carrig — Kickstarter
45," The TROLLER 1D is my newest robot project.  The concept uses a series of simple 'links' to make up the TROLLER.  Its locomotion can be similar to that of a caterpillar or snake while laying flat, but the novel concept is that it can roll itself into a large circle and still propel itself (like tank treads) by shifting links in the proper sequencing.  May 28, 2012 – Update:  Back to the drawing board...I'm anxious to keep this project moving, so I spent a good part of the long weekend completely redesigning the TROLLER prototype (with parts I already have).  I laser cut and assembled a complete new TROLLER prototype.I made this version wider, to make it more stable.  Then I doubled up some of the servos to get extra torque at the master link.  I still have countless hours of programming ahead of me; but a after a short while I was able to get it a complete revolution out of the new prototype.Although the new prototype demonstrates my need for better servo motors and equipment it also is teaching me more about how to make this TROLLER go round-and-round.  The goal of this project is to refine the second iteration prototype design into a functional robotic product kit.  The first version will be the TROLLER 1D.  This version of TROLLER will only be capable of moving along 1 dimension.  By limiting the focus of this project to a single dimension, I will be able to perfect the initial two concepts --'Propulsion by Self Rolling' and 'Crawling'.Propulsion by Self Rolling works by shifting the links in sequences to rotate itself around the perimeter.  To refine this concept the TROLLER 1D will use motion sensing capabilities like the sensors found in a Wii remote (accelerometers  and gyroscopic sensors).  These sensors will allow the control programming to learn how to roll at different speeds, how to change directions, and how to transition into crawling mode.  Crawling propulsion will be achieved by mimicking the movements of a caterpillar.  Proper sequencing of the servos will allow smooth transitioning. Mechanical design:  I will begin this effort by refining the mechanical link design into a 'Master Link' and 'Link Units'.  The 'Master Link' will enclose the main controller, motion sensing & wireless communication circuitry, a battery pack, and servo motors.  The 'Link Units' will have servo motors and additional battery packs It would then take 1 Master Unit and 3 or 4 Link Units to make up a full TROLLER 1D.Motion Sensing & Control:  The main controller will be responsible for controlling the TROLLER 1D.  It will use wireless (Bluetooth or WiFi) communication to the host PC and motion sensing electronics to measure acceleration and rotation, while rolling.  This circuitry will be designed during the project phase.This Kickstarter effort will provide the funding needed to further develop the motion sensing and locomotion concepts and turn my crude prototype into a functional product kit.  The funds will be used to purchase and test more powerful servo motors, micro-controllers, motion sensing circuitry, wireless Bluetooth or WiFi modules, and the hardware needed to assemble the TROLLER.TROLLER 1D Kits:  The end result of this Kickstarter effort will produce an educational TROLLER 1D robot kit that will be available on the new TROBOTOWN.com website.  Because the actual parts needed to build the TROLLER are not yet known, most TROLLER kits offered as rewards will not include servos or control electronics.  However, I will offer a very limited number of complete kits that willl be a duplicate of whatever the final design ends up being.At the end of the design effort I will present the material costs for servos and electronics and offer those at the best deal I can by purchasing large quantities in-bulk from my suppliers, and passing the savings on to you.Although the TROLLER 1D will move along a single dimension, future TROLLER's will build off of the 1D link units and be capable of moving in multiple directions.  Pivoting and rotating links units will be created.  Below is a future concept drawing for the 'TROLLER DUO' - with a payload box, and the ability to roll, crawl, and even walk like other 4 legged robots.I normally work with BIG robots like these (some capable of moving 500kg at 7000mm/s):I spend much of my free time developing small robot projects and working with embedded control systems.  Most recently I developed some small articulated robots called ""TROBOTs"".  They were inspired by my desire to create a small, ultra low-cost, yet capable hobby robot.  The newest version, TROBOT 4.0 is the result another successful Kickstarter project http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tbaumg/trobot-40-a-miniature-articulated-robot.As rewards, I'm offering TROBOT kits & related products.  Most of the items seen on the new TROBOTOWN.com website are now being offered as rewards.For the first time, I'll be offering TROBOT 3, TROBOT 4, and TROLLER Link kits as a 'Glue-It-Yourself' option.  The process is similar to putting together a plastic model car or plane.  I will soon be posting a 'How to glue TROBOT kits' tutorial video. Also, all backers will get their name added to a special ""Thank You"" section of the official website.I did a Google Search on ‘TROLLER robot’ and I was
surprised to see so many links (like engadget and hackaday). I really like one

Plug Crafty into a USB for 30 seconds, unplug and you've got a moving robot.Crafty is powered by the Fizzbit, a rechargeable module that can bring movement to any robot creation however you want to make it. CAD your own moving robot with only two parts! Don't fancy CAD? Just download this sweet moving Unicorn. We'll be creating new models regularly and we hope others will too!We've got loads of free templates (from Kanyes to Cowboys) to download and print at home, We'll be adding more every month. Fancy designing your own? We've got blank templates to get you started and once you're done we'd love to host your designs so other people can make them too.I've got you. With the Fizzbit you can make a robot out of almost anything. The only limit is your imagination.Crafty Robots are not programmable. Their behaviour is defined by their physical shape and material. Creating a new robot that behaves in a particular way requires a process of experimentation and iteration.Right now there's a lot of focus on getting kids to code so they can build the future. This is a good thing but it risks too narrow a focus. Code is only useful as part of the process of turning technology into actual things people can use and enjoy. This process is design and engineering.Today the technology that's changing the world is digital, back in the previous technological revolution it was electricity and steel and the one before steam and iron. By the time today's children begin their careers the digital revolution might be done and a new technology on the way.What will always remain useful is understanding how to use technology creatively. How to shape it to your needs and desires through experimentation and iteration. Inventing Crafty Robots with the Fizzbit make this process accessible, immediate, tangible and fun dramatically lowering the entry point.Once you're happy shaping technology to your ends it's a great time to learn to code. We see the crafty Robot as a fun and affordable first stepping stone towards more advanced robots based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino.The Crafty Robot is designed to be kind to the planet. The Fizzbit doesn't use batteries (not even rechargeable ones which still contain polluting materials and only last a few hundred cycles). Instead it uses a supercapacitor (a technology used in Formula 1 energy recovery systems) which can be re-charged thousands of times.Because the Fizzbit can be re-used to make dozens of different robots, you can have the excitement of a new toy without anywhere near the environmental impact. All you are throwing away (or recycling) when you make a new Crafty Robot is some paper.We did a life cycle analysis of the Crafty Robot compared to another popular vibrating robot toy. We found that through manufacture and use only, Crafty Robots generate only a third of the CO2 emissions compared to the other robots.Fizzbits and robot templates will both be made in the UK. This means that quality and workplace conditions will both be what you would want plus we can make our first batch of Crafty Robots and get them out to you really quickly.The Fizzbit is a USB powered rechargeable vibration module. It stores energy in a supercapacitor which takes 30 seconds to charge. When it's unplugged the vibration motor starts running immediately and runs for just over 30 seconds before it needs another quick charge. It can be re-charged with anything that has a USB port; your computer, USB hub, phone charger, car, Coolest Cooler, 747 etc. You can attach your Fizzbit to your robot creations using glue, foam tape, rubber bands, Blue Tac, Sugru and many more crafty methods. We've made a small run of Fizzbits already so we know they work and can be manufactured.There are seven Crafty Robots. Orange has three siblings Blue, Social and Precious. Their cousins, Gunpei, Jerry and Alastair are also related to iconic pieces of digital technology.Crafty Robots would not exist without the help of some incredibly kind and talented people. The Fizzbit wouldn't be manufacturable without Kevin, Andy, Geoff and Aaron. The Robots wouldn't be scalable without Rose and Alison. They wouldn't be nearly as fun without the advice of everyone who has played with earlier versions and given feedback. Thanks to all the Maker Faire patrons I've met as well as Mark, Albie and Milo. Thanks to Cedric for running the LCA. Thanks to Aron, Lea, Jude (from Design Modelling) and Heather for their advice, creativity and for being in the video.

47," One of the main components robots use is called a linear actuator. An linear actuator is basically a motor that pushes and pulls to make things move. If you have seen ""C-3PO"" in Star Wars, The ""Terminator"" or ""Johnny Five"" (Short Circuit), then you've seen actuators.If you have ever tried to build a robot or something robotic, you probably had to look for some kind of actuator for your project but soon found that getting the right one was almost impossible because it was super expensive or it just didn’t have the right features, speed or power that you needed. As a result, you probably had to modify your project to fit the actuator.I’ve been in your shoes. I was working on a project that needed a low cost actuator and getting the right one with the features I wanted was not possible.After several months of research, designing, prototyping and testing, I finally came up with the Maker Muscle: The world’s first low cost customizable actuator system.I designed the Maker Muscle to be a fully customizable actuator solution so you don’t have to adjust your project to fit the actuator, you can now get the right actuator to fit your project...AND without breaking the bank!Robots, robots, robots! They are everywhere! Anything you need help moving, an actuator can probably come to the rescue. Here's just a few examples of where the Maker Muscle can be used.Robotic Projects - Make things move, make some motion art.Education - Robotic clubs and engineering. Home AutomationIoT Applications - Wireless Enabled ActuatorsAutomotiveCosplay & Special effects...Basically, If you need to move something, the Maker Muscle actuator can help!Create the perfect speed and power by combining the right motor with the right drive screw for your needs. Use the motor you like to work with, like a geared DC motor, or my favorite, the stepper motor. Make it extend to any length you want by just modifying a few parts. Need it to be 1inch?...or maybe 3 feet? Maker Muscle reaches out.Add mounting anywhere you like with it’s T-Slot system on all 4 sides of the Maker Muscle Core. You can even mount the electronics on the body.Customize and add more features that you want so it does exactly what you need, like endstops, or encoders.With all these features you’ll have the perfect actuator without breaking the bank.Here's what it looks like. All the ""Kit"" rewards will get one too!I started this project because of a need I had while building a 3D scanner for scanning people, simply put: a 3D selfie robot. When I went to look for actuators, I found the selection was very limited and I got quoted for hundreds or thousands of dollars for a customized actuator. This obviously wasn't going to help my project.So I did what most makers do when you can't find something...You make it! After making my own actuator, the way I wanted, I realized that this could change the huge gap in the market that's missing for makers, hobbyist, educators, and even professionals.Maker Muscle was born to help create awesome robotic projects at much lower costs than ever before.Now I need your help to get this off the ground running. I have successfully delivered 2 kickstarter projects in the past so I know what it takes to deliver this one. The cool part is that I already have most of the major parts designed and lined up for manufacturing. I even have the first batch of the Maker Muscle core ready to go. The only thing missing is your pledge and the amazing projects you are going to create with the Maker Muscle.Thank you for your support and don’t forget to share this with your maker friends.",Diego Porqueras,"$27,319",Unstated,The first fully customizable & low cost actuator system for Makers!

48," Professional Robotic Arm That’s Economic and Smart
 
Dobot M1 is made to reverse one simple fact: industrial robotic arms are toooo expensive. With 0.02mm precision, velocity of 200 degrees per second, 1.5kg workload and 400mm maximum reach, Dobot M1 makes a perfect essence for a professional workspace, where you can do light manufacturing, and we managed to keep the price under surprising $2000. 
 
Not only that, with features like self-developed user interface, wireless connectivity, handhold teaching, and multi-Dobot cooperation capability, we've provided the most user-friendly environment for self-employers and factories to build their own production platform.NOTICE：shipping fee is updated. Please find in this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lVsr0CbSADyuL2mzQYyNbqPaVp4H5afAe09tsohtlSY/edit?usp=sharingNOW IT'S UNLOCKED!!! The suction cup will be shipped to every backer along with Dobot M1.We invited Udi, a photography website editor, to come and spend some time with Dobot M1. And here's how he liked the arm in his perspective:There's also a Russian visitor Sergey. And this is what he said (in Russian): https://geektimes.ru/sandbox/4630/
 
With Dobot M1’s precision, strength and a little bit of your innovation, Dobot M1 can realize features even more than a traditional industrial robotic arm. One color, more colors. Small size, bigger size. Dobot M1 doesn’t limit your imagination. Dobot M1 has 400mm radius and 250mm height printing area itself, and you can extend this printing area with a 1m long trail.Dobot M1 is also able to do SLA 3D printing. Here's a brief demo of how it's done with a projector:With Pulse-Width-Modulated laser, it can do both line engraving and shade engraving. Now you can have your favorite photo on many materials, a good way of material handling.With a more powerful laser head, it can laser cut on a certain of materials. (This laser head won't be provided due to varied custom regulation)*Note: don't look directly at the laser beam while it's engraving, it would be harmful to your eyes. We'll provide a goggle with the laser engraving kit.Bring efficiency into soldering, a high concentration requiring work. Customize your circuit any time! You can build more complicated tool heads like this on Dobot M1’s easy-to-change head tool design.
 
There’s more. Dobot M1 can be very smart with some accessories, increasing your efficiency and creating more value.Computer vision can extend the uses of a robotic arm to a higher level. Dobot M1 has integrated visual API, which can be easily adapted with OpenCV or your own visual system. Picking and placing objects can be smarter from now on.Parts transfering, handling packing and sorting can benefit from Dobot M1’s visual recognizing ability. Recognize, pick, rotate and place, smoothly done without any mistake. Give you a hand and it's awesome. Give you two and you can create magic. You can connect to more than one Dobot M1 at once, especially with its wireless connectivity. The possibilities out of the combination are endless.The built-in mapping and path planning system expands Dobot M1’s reach to a whole floor, working as a high-precision execution end, performing tasks like automatic inventory management or in-house service.
 
You might start thinking about it

Dobot M1 is highly expandable. With standardized head tool port, and complete protocol, API and SDK, multiple hardware extension ports, what you’ve never imagined can now actually become real!Simplest Head Tool Port
 
Unscrew it, insert, screw it back in, done. It’s that simple.
 
Developing Dobot M1Dobot M1 is completely programmable. You can use the official script writing environment, or access to its API & SDK on your own. If you’re a stranger to coding, which is totally ok, there’s the visualized programming environment embedded for easier development.
 
Dobot Community
 
Welcome to Dobot Forum, a place where you can find help for developing, audience to your great invention, or just friends who share your thoughts!It’s a fun and exciting thing to watch your work done, bit by bit. To ensure that everyone gets to enjoy the process of making, there’re a few user-friendly features built in Dobot M1, and they allow you to use Dobot M1 without any knowledge of programming. When you use it, you’ll be surprized at how many fun ways there are of using a robotic arm. Dobot Studio features a large working space to get creative, and access to advanced settings anytime.The playback list supports editing, re-ordering, saving and importing. So once the Dobot M1 is calibrated and the movements are created, it can be fastly applied to all other arms.This visualized programming feature provides an intuitive way to program a robotic arm. It contains major APIs for Dobot robotic arms, and also has access to accessories connected to its I/O ports. The script programming environment is created for professional users. It's based on Python, and is integrated with full Dobot APIs.
 
Great Specs Behind Great Capability
 
The perfect calibration of DC servo motor, harmonic reducer and kinematic algorithm inside Dobot M1 has brought the best out of Dobot M1. You’ll be amazed at how reliable when it’s working, and you can trust it with your tasks.Structure
 
The Dobot M1’s design introduced virtual prototype and structural dynamic simulation, also refined each component’s design and the selection of servo reducers, improving the overall mechanical and electrical system.
 
MotorsThe self-developed DC brushless driving system comes with vibration suppression and inertia compensation algorithm, effectively improving its dynamic response and stability at high speed.
 
Reducer
 
We customized and developed a harmonic reducer system for light SCARA type robotic arms, including a supporting bearing structure and a fastening method. We managed to cut down the weight of the harmonic reducers without compromising Dobot M1’s overall performance.
 
Controlling AlgorithmWe integrated into the high-speed controlling system certain features including vibration suppression on servo system, combined driver & controller, enhanced overall dynamic response through inertia compensation and speed feedforward.One simple fact: an industrial SCARA type robotic arm prices between $10,000 and $20,000, two-year payback period. For many small businesses constantly adjusting their production technique, this is too much to afford, not to mention those creative individuals who want a professional making machine.
With less than $2,000, and 3 months of payback period, Dobot M1 is here to fill the missing puzzle.With more functions and features, Dobot M1 is able to integrate in more steps of production, helping you save more budget.NOTICE: Shipping Fee ISN'T Covered in Pledge  
 Shipping fee isn't covered in the pledge amount, so are that of the products and parts. We're sorry not to include them in the rewards, but they are too varied for different parts and destinations.

In a future email we'll ask you for which specific toolhead or accessory you want.We've found something new

 Unlike Dobot 1.0, Dobot M1 is designed for a different group of people, who need a more powerful, professional robotic arm that’s affordable, something in between a toy-like model and a high end industrial one. It’s new, no one’s made this product before. And since we enjoy talking to the brilliant minds on Kickstarter, we decided to launch the project here and let you keep talking about it!How we got here  - Dobot 1.0  

 Our first baby and first step into robotics, the Dobot 1.0 featured 7 different ways of controlling a robotic arm, so that robotic arms are no longer geeks’ exclusives, and everyone gets to enjoy a live with lots of helps and automation.  How we got here  - Dobot Magician  

 As the second generation of robotic arms, Dobot Magician went further on the path of becoming a consumer-oriented, and at the same time highly expandable product. It’s unibody, easy to control, and does unbelievable tasks like 3D printing and shaded laser engraving. It’s also highly extendable with all kinds of ports, visualized programming and APIs.

Watch how Dobot Magician is applied to industrial environments: Watch how the Dobot Magician creates a couplet for Chinese new year:Can we deliver? 
 
 

 We're still on the way of improving every feature and finalizing the product, but we're confident to ship it to your hands by April/May 2017. Our first product, Dobot 1.0 has been upgrated to Dobot Magician, and it's already finalized and being sold on a regular basis.

I am backer 5 but I didn't receive anything.~Hi everyone!Has someone already received a Dobot M1? Can you provide some feedback?~Hi guys. Since updating is not really the strength of Dobot, I just wanted to share with you this video I found on youtube. It has been posted two weeks ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch…~And another promise that the refund would be ""handled within a week"" and yet another week without a refund.~@Dobot - please share the status of the extension kits and tool heads as well, shouldn't be the case where the arm is ready but the extensions are not. Also will you be using backerkit or other similar survey to add in any tool heads/extensions or additional units? Given that you are so near, a lot of backers (including me) may want to customize the options for our tool heads and extensions so long as its possible from your end to do.~Thanks for the update.~@dobot.cc - actually what I really want is the robot arm that's why I backed this campaign a year ago.~@dobot.cc~Appreciate your reply - that update link is for the September update which we have all read, thank you~For those here thinking about refunds...~The communication from the creators here is appalling. Tell us what is going on - it can not be that hard~Just looking at some of the comments here: https://www.facebook.com/dobotarm/ this is not very reassuring, even if they do deliver if this is what to be expected in terms of customer support then it does not give me much confidence :-(~OK, this is just too much, I am planning on getting a refund, they have held my money for so long, it should be returned + interest !~Dobot M1 is a scam and disgrace to Kickstarter. What is the refund process? Does it actually work, or does it still rely on these scammers to do the right thing?~The next update was promised to be given at the end of octobre. We’re in novembre now...~@Nopparat: Likewise, have been waiting for a week, in fact.~Waiting for refund~It is extremely disappointing and deceitful not to be updated though we might understand there could be delayed.

You promised a update (with pictures of the parts) in 3 weeks, in the last message. This was 5 weeks ago...~Time for another update~This is my first kickstarter project and are bitterly disappointed, the communication is atrocious, and I am beginning to wonder whether this will ever happen ?!~Just for you to know, it seems the Regiet team and DOBOT Team are the same (I received an email from Regiet signed as DOBOT Team). And what happens with Regiet delivery is a complete mess: DHL retaining the reward at Singapore until you pay an extra fee (mine was €45 but it appears to be variant). Tracking is not as good as expected. So my advice, if they plan to use the same delivery service, start to save money in case you should need to pay an extra fee.~Nice update, looking forward to the Dobot Pros with all the improvements and stability fixes. I can see a real use for these where I work, might just end up being a long term customer for a bigger requirement if it comes out as well as I'm imaginging right now =)~Glad to know that, looking forward to their update soon.~@  Raphael Rätz~Thanks Raphael Ratz for posting Dobot reply .

49," Wow, we've reached $65,000 in 11 days! Thank you all so much for your support, this has been such an amazing ride so far! We want to take a quick moment to point out our next stretch goal - this is what will happen if we keep going:At $95,000, we’ll drop in what we call the “Performance Upgrade”. We’ll
integrate a number of new sensors that will let us more accurately detect and
respond to rough terrain, allowing for a smooth ride over a much greater
variety of terrain. We’ll upgrade our hydraulic powerplant to allow for a
higher ground speed. We’ll also add sensors that will allow for some amount of
autonomy, for future robot development.And now, back to our Kickstarter page!We dream of a world where imagination becomes reality simply because enough passionate people decide that an idea has merit. We dream of robots of all shapes and sizes being made across the globe, because the high-end technology needed to make them is  simplified, generalized, and made publicly accessible.The first step in achieving that dream for us is building a rideable, 18 foot  wide,
4,000 pound, 6-legged, engine-powered hydraulic walking robot named Stompy, and
sharing exactly how we did it with the world. 

We are Project Hexapod. We’re a team of 3
instructors, 1 TA, and 15 students based out of a makerspace in Somerville, Massachusetts called Artisan’s Asylum. We’ve spent
the last four months running a class on how to design giant robots,
 and  Stompy is the
end result. Our instructors (Gui Cavalcanti, James Whong, and Dan Cody) 
are professional
roboticists who have designed military and commercial robot legs, arms, 
prosthetics, walking machines, and more. Our TA (Adam Bercu) is a 
national champion Battlebots builder, and
our students come from backgrounds ranging as widely as engineers 
working for defense contractors to professional programmers to 
electronics enthusiasts.You
may have heard of us and Stompy before, a couple of months back – we were written up in
Wired, Boing Boing, Hack A Day, DVICE, Hizook, the Boston Globe, and Engadget, among
others. First of all, we’re building a giant walking
robot that you can ride, and if all goes according to plan, we’ll be
showing it off at a festival or fair near you. Depending on your level of
support, you may even get to ride it or drive it - how about that?Beyond
that, though, your support for Project Hexapod will drive a personal robotics revolution (if we have anything
to say about it). The past twenty years have seen an explosion of
productivity in hobbyist robotics made possible by cheap, easy to use
microcontrollers and RC servos. The hobbyist community has built a wealth
of knowledge and infrastructure around these components, but RC servos severely
limit the size of robot you can build.Project Hexapod wants to make large-scale robots
easier to build, and inspire people to build them. Stompy is 6
 giant steps towards that dream. Once we finish this robot,
we’re releasing our plans, our CAD, our diagrams, the presentations from
 all the
lectures we gave in class, our lists of materials and parts, everything.
 The
construction and control techniques we're using will drop the cost of
controlled hydraulics by an order of magnitude or two from where they 
are now, and will make giant robots affordable to small groups of
enthusiasts everywhere.The robot isn't just being built for fun, though - it has incredibly practical purposes, as well. With 6 force-sensitive legs and a ground clearance of 6 feet, the robot will be able to walk over broken terrain that varies from mountainous areas, to rubble piles, to water up to 7 or 8 feet deep - everywhere existing ground vehicles can't go. Not only that, but while navigating such terrain, Stompy could carry 1,000 pounds at 2-3 mph, and up to 4,000 pounds at 1 mph. This is important because in disaster areas like Haiti's Port Au Prince, it's taken more than three years to clear the rubble out of some areas - meaning that throughout that entire time, people have had to be rescued or resupplied by helicopter, because no ground vehicle could reach them. Stompy (and the technology it represents) could easily reach people who can't be reached by any other means in a natural disaster.We’re not your 
average Kickstarter campaign, so
we don’t have  your average Kickstarter levels. At a level of support of
 $100 or below, we’re going to shout your name from the top of the White
 Mountains, give you a ton
of cool swag (designed by local artists Maria Stangel and Ecco Pierce), and list you as a supporter on our website. At the $10 level, that swag includes a bumper sticker proclaiming your desires for your other car:The $20 level includes a robot
apocalypse friendship bracelet that reads 'FRIEND OF ROBOTS - DO NOT TERMINATE'; wear it to ensure your safety during the upcoming robot revolution! At the $40 level, you get your choice of one of the following T-shirts:At the $75 level, you'll get both shirts (or two of one, if you prefer). Feel free to add $35 to any pledge level to get an additional shirt!Finally, at the $100 level, we'll send you a signed photo of the entire team in front of the finished Stompy, giving the camera cheesy thumbs ups! After the swag levels, though, things get…interesting.
At the $200 level, you get to choose between having 10 characters of your
choice welded onto our chassis or supplying an inanimate object of your choice
for Stompy to crush mercilessly. At the $300 level you get a ride, at the
$1,000 level you get to drive, and at the $2,500 to $5,000 level you (or your company) get to be listed as a sponsor. At the $10,000 level we’ll fly you out to Boston for a weekend (if you’re
in the lower 48 states – international supporters, call us beforehand!), give
you free ice cream and burgers, and take field trips with Stompy to local rubble piles and
scrap yards.
Contact us directly if you’re interested in higher levels; $25,000 will get you
a Stompy appearance in the lower 48 states once the robot’s done, and $300,000
will get you another Stompy of your very own!Over the past four months, we've...Right now we’re building a full-scale prototype
leg to make sure our design methodology, actuator sizing, and finite element 
analysis are all up to snuff before anyone sets foot in the actual robot. Once we
establish that, we’ll be finishing the design of our chassis – at the end of
our four week Kickstarter campaign, we expect we’ll be ready to press print on
our drawings and start cutting and welding steel!We’re asking for a lot of money, and it’s all
going straight into the hardware necessary to build the robot. We estimate that
each leg will cost around $6,000, to cover the 350 pounds of waterjet-cut
steel, high quality shock absorbers, three hydraulic cylinders, valves,
sensors, and what have you. The body of the robot (which accounts for around 1,000
pounds of steel), consumables, electronics, and miscellaneous items like screws
and wire make up the balance.While $65,000 sounds like a lot of 
money for a project
claiming to be low cost, bear in mind that an equivalent robot built 
with high-end technology could easily cost on the order of a couple of
million dollars. As a point of reference, using our technology results in position-controlled hydraulic actuators that can produce 18,000 pounds of force, with strokes up to 2 feet in length... for all of $400 an axis. That's less than some hobby servos. Most of the cost of this project is in steel and other components.Once we get the money, we'll order the thousands 
of pounds of steel, start the waterjet running at Excell Solutions (our contracted machine
 shop), and start welding everything together at Artisan's Asylum. We're budgeting 8 months to finish the robot, from the initial steel order. Once we finish the robot, we’ll have a series of demo days and festivals where
we give rides, let people drive, stomp things for fun, and more!We have big plans for what will happen if this takes off…At $95,000, we’ll drop in what we call the “Performance Upgrade”. We’ll
integrate a number of new sensors that will let us more accurately detect and
respond to rough terrain, allowing for a smooth ride over a much greater
variety of terrain. We’ll upgrade our hydraulic powerplant to allow for a
higher ground speed. We’ll also add sensors that will allow for some amount of
autonomy, for future robot development.
At $125,000, we’re going to install the “Flair Upgrade”. We’ll give Stompy an
animatronic head, a killer paint job, a sound system, and (pending a full
safety review of the robot once it’s built) flame effects.
At $300,000, we’re going to make this a Really Big Deal. We’re going to buy a
waterjet cutter and install it at Artisan’s Asylum for public use, start a company
devoted to creating open-source high-end robotic technology, and start
developing a zoo’s worth of rideable robots. We’re not even kidding.

You could possibly move faster with 8 while remaining stable, but that assumes you can power (and pay for!) the extra legs. The frame would likely be larger to accommodate the extra legs as well, adding more weight/cost and further increasing power requirements as a result.~Congratulations on passing your target!~Mini hexapod! https://www.youtube.com/watch…~Only $27,368 to reach the “performance upgrade”!~AAAAAAND we reached the 65000~Cheers and donation from http://www.opensourceecology.org - Send us your hydraulic designs! / Check it out!~I never thought rass roots roboticism could be so inspirational.  But them I'm just a truck.~Great idea and have backed you. Could you make the roof round so that if the spider was to topple it would roll onto its legs. Would this help if it was to climb over rubble. Looking at the leg ends. Are these the finished design. Again if it was going over rubble would the legs benefit from a diffrent shape or design. Look forward to the project on the road! with picures. Vincenzo~Good luck! Awesome idea!~Hi guys and hi Stompy. My name is Jack and I'm also doing a project on kickstarter called Z Minus. I think your project is great and I'd like to see it mass produced around the world. I know I'd like to go stomping down my street with a giant 6-legged robot. Come check out my project on kickstarter too. I'm sure you'll like it as much as I like yours.JACK~I've put down a pledge, but I haven't yet upped it to include shipping costs.

This is the lowest cost kit for makers who already have an Arduino platform and bins full of parts from previous projects.  This kit does not include any motors.  It does include:HumanThis kit lets you create animatronics of a human like nature. This kit is the easiest to build, and has a wide variety of uses.ToonThis kit lets you create toon characters, and has oversized toon eyes. Great for making cartoon, chibi, and anime characters.ToonimalThis kit lets you create toon animals. It has oversized toon eyes, and comes with three different sets of jaws so you can create almost any animal. (This is the style used in the Frantik the Dragon Orlando Mini Maker Faire Promo video).StarBots come in three fluorescent colors.- Fluorescent Red- Fluorescent Blue- Fluorescent GreenPlease specify you color when pledging.As a Bonus for reaching our funding goal. I have engineered a pocket in the eye assembly that fits LED's nicely. You can run your StarBot with or without the LED's, and EVERYONE will get the LED Kit!As someone who takes his animatronics out to events, classes and sometimes just for fun. I wondered what would I like as a first stretch goal, and I came up with this.
Now you can take your StarBot anywhere, and not have to worry about having a plug. Most of my animatronics are mobile, I can take them ANYWHERE, and now so can you.When we hit $10,000 EVERY KIT with an Arduino will get one Battery Pack. The star★bot Kit is used to teach kids ""Intro to Arduino & Animatronics"" classes at The Orlando Science Center, and was on display at the Orlando Mini Maker Faire 2013. The kids were excited to learn about microcontrollers, mechanics, animating, and had lots of fun. The starbots Kit is easy to assemble. Just screw the plastic pieces together, install the servos, apply the eye decals, and snap in the eyes.Your starbot Kit will come with the Arduino pre-programmed. You will also be able to download the code and tweak it yourself. Wiring up the starbot Kit is easy to do, just follow the instructions using the included jumper wires.Papercraft characters, people and animals will be available, or you can make your own.One Little Spark:How did the kits become a reality? After making animatronics for many decades and everyone always asking ""How it's done?"", I had been developing an animatronic kit, but didn't have a launch date set. One 'Maker Saturday' at The Orlando Science Center in Florida, I was asked if I would help teach an ""Intro to Arduino Class"", I gladly said ""Yes"". The class was in Dr. Dare's Laboratory (an awesome venue in the round), I helped a mother and her young daughter. When it came time to learn about servos, I took out my iPhone and showed them my Animatronic Toucan singing Feliz Navidad, and explained that when I move a controller I can make his mouth move. They both laughed and thought it was so cool. A little while went by, and while I was leaning behind the young girl and talking to the mother, we both could hear a small little voice singing, it was soft and low, and we could hear it was Felz Navidad. Both of us looked over and the young girl is turning the potentiometer and moving the servo in sequence to her singing of Feliz Navidad! The mom and I started laughing so hard our sides hurt. This was the ""Spark"" to finish the kit, build eight prototypes, and teach my own ""Intro to Arduino and Animatronics"" class, which was a big hit. ~ Pat StaracePat Starace has been building animatronics for more than 20 years.  From the very first time he introduced his early creations, people wanted to know how they worked and how they could make one themselves.  More recently, as Pat has become an active part of the maker community in central Florida, he’s been working on a way to make animatronics more accessible to beginners.Pat got to thinking about what is difficult about creating animatronics.  Not everyone has easy access to the materials and tools needed to shape and form heads and eyes, so that was one important piece of the puzzle.  A kit for beginners to create animatronics would need to be easy to build, have great movements, and be both durable and affordable. The Star★Bot platform was designed with CAD and run through many simulations to test the design to make sure the movements would be convincing and the parts would work correctly together. To make the kits, acrylic pieces are laser cut. Mold plugs are created on a CNC mill and the eyes are thermal formed. Additional parts for the eye mechanism are cut on a CNC lathe, and each eye gets finished off in a press.  All of these processes ensure precise and consistent finished pieces.Right now, each kit has to be hand-made piece by piece, and that drives up the cost.  Going from making 8 prototypes to making a production run takes the help of supporters and Kickstarter. The funds raised by this Kickstarter campaign will enable us to gain economies of scale by mass-producing some of the parts while still retaining the precision Pat demands. We have the components and materials completely sourced, the equipment and build location in place, we just need your support. When the kits can be produced for less money, the purchase price can be reduced, and more people can afford to buy their own Star★Bot!Our goal is to deliver as many 'StarBot Human Kits' as we can produce in time for the Holidays. Toon and Toonimals will have a delivery schedule set for January. Supporters will be kept informed of the production progress via update posts, pictures and videos.Pat takes a few of his creations up to Children's Hospitals and has been doing it for over 20+ years.

Travel with your new buddy and establish your new friendship.Propeller-propelled Unmanned Underwater VehicleThe idea of BIKI has arrived!What should an underwater robot fish look like? We see fish, the freest creatures enjoying the 80 percent of the secrets on this planet. To truly bring human beings into the underwater world, we were driven to create BIKI.   Streamlined and fishtail designThe BIKI’s fishtail uses a super-firm, natural rubber and a high elasticity alloy to mimic the tail bone of a fish.Bionic Snorkeling MovementBased on the IMU, Autonomous Control Algorithm ROBOSEA ™, and Kalman Filter Attitude Algorithm from fluid dynamics, BIKI is able to keep its balance in the water.Unprecedented Underwater CommunicationSimilar to a dolphin, BIKI uses biological sonar echo-location to find objects in the environment. In this way, BIKI can code and modulate operational orders through its power amplifier (PA) to propel an acoustic transducer, thus converting an electronic signal to an ultrasonic signal. Through any water medium, the transducer receives the sonic wave signal and transfers it to an electronic signal. Then, a digital signal processor decodes the signals and restores operational orders via digital signal processing. Thus, by adopting the different frequencies of sonic waves to control the trajectory, we do not need to use wires to control the underwater robot fish anymore.  Chicken Head Tracking (Resource from the internet)  Controlled by controller (under the water)BIKI can launch sonic waves of different bandwidths through the internal transducer, which allows you to operate the camera in any water-medium, from the pool to the ocean, by using a controller. Controlled by app: Route customization (in the air)Control by app, BIKI can show you the underwater scenes at real-time in shallow water - or you can make BIKI dive into deep water by customizing the route and setting the depth.         BIKI applies the technology of ABS crashworthiness and resistance-to-weathering glass fiber. Thus no matter what difference in temperature from 0 to 70°C (32-158°F), corrosive offshore environment, or under long-term sunlight, BIKI will always be kept in perfect condition.As the CEO of Robosea, Dr.Xiong Minglei was the major researcher in the intelligent control room of the engineering institute of Peking University. Dr. Minglei invented and developed the first underwater robot with dual reconfigurable tail fins, which was sailing in the Antarctic regions. The underwater robot played a significant role in the exploration into unknown territory. It achieved the smoothest underwater operation and gathered the water data via live transmission with the lowest cost and at the highest efficiency of underwater movement. The Antarctic adventure tour was a success, thanks to the underwater robot created by Dr. Minglei .  We not only exceed the traditional unmanned underwater vehicles on the market today, but also hope to exceed ourselves. In the development of BIKI, we continuously debug the functional prototype. Finally, we are proud to announce we achieved the best and most powerful BIKI.        BIKI x1, Waterproof Bag x1, Controller x1, Charging Cable x1, Charger x1            ",Robosea,"$222,232",Unstated,"The most powerful, ecological and portable wireless underwater drone.

Has anyone who received this yet gotten any other color besides white?~An operation that keeps promising, delaying, making WEAK excuses, on product they CLAIM to be shipping to those who purchased their GHOST-LIKE product,  is often called 'fraudulent' in law enforcement ranks.Promised Delivery Date: Sep 2017  ...... new delivery date:  Sep 2040.Where is INTERPOL when you need them ?~Why is it that you have so poor communications and you don’t want to post message for all backers that deserve respect instead of receiving email case by case. Due to poor communications, excuses and lack of info, most backers are unhappy and lack support with their problems, over late delivery... CES is finished since a few days and still no update.  What is the status on problems?Have you stopped delivery to correct those issues?~To all backersBiki are at CES actually they say.  Can some backers nearby Vegas  if there are, go and meet them so we can real answers and confront them on problems posted here (drone not going down in saltwater or turning round.... posted by Daryl) and why backer 450 received his Biki and not previous backers?It's time we get real answers and support from Biki~Original September delivery is passed.  First delay October delivery has passedNovember delivery annoncement has passedDecember excuse because of transport company is gone.  Christmas is finished now. (As of January 9, everybody is back to normal life) ... except maybe BIKI team maybe.Now CES is another excuse....   Unbelievable...  No cell phone or email available there?Will Chinese holidays be the next excuse for delays?~Backer #237 here. No Biki so far. ~#295 still waiting!  Just curious, has it only been white ones being shipped? Has anyone who received this yet gotten any other color besides white? I ordered a yellow one so I'm wondering if they are doing one color at a time.~Hm - #27 (twenty seven) and still waiting...~has anyone else from the UK bought a biki.. if so, have you been hit with a VAT bill from Fedex? thought paying the delivery/shipping charges should have covered this.~Backer #294 still waiting...~I am currently diving in salt water and the BIKI will not go down. However, when I put it in the fresh water gear rinsing tub (this is the only large source of fresh water I have) it seems to go down at least two feet until it hits the bottom of the bucket...does this mean that BIKIs are weighted for neutral buoyancy in fresh water but not salt water? Please respond.~I am also testing mine in the ocean. Mine stays upright and takes good pictures however, does not respond well on the surface to either the controller or my phone and refuses to go down at all. If it is neutrally buoyant device, it should at least stay down when I take it to depth but it doesn't do that either. It slowly floats back to the surface. If it is a neutrally buoyant device then I am not sure how the up/down functions work. It also seems to swim in circles whether I am telling it to go straight or not! LOL!~well. i've been trying my biki out in the ocean and it does not work!. it does not want to respond to the remote controller in the water and the biki will not descend at all!  it does occasionally tail fin on the surface by itself but the biki just falls to its side and swims in a circle! .. was my biki tested before you sent it out to me? ~Backer #295 and still waiting!~나는 372후원자인데 왜 후원자가 아닌 사람보다 배송이 늦는것인가?이런식으로 일을 할꺼면 뭐하러 후원자를 모집한건야?~Hi all, I can confirm I have received my BIKI today. I am backer no. 450. I just wanted to ask everyone who received their BIKI. Has anyone noticed that the rubber plug for the charging port on the BIKI doesnt seem to be fully tight. I am nervous if I take it out to the ocean, with the pressure at depths above 20m, water might creep into the charging port and damage the battery compartment.~Hi I received a message from Fedex and wanted to know if it’s for the BIKI please? I’ve checked the item eight and it weighs lower than 5KG. Can you confirm if my BIKI has been shipped and the tracking information please? Thank you. A. Irish.~Please give me a refund.~There really needs to be some better documentation that provides some more details as to how to operate this drone. It’s not as intuitive as it should be. I haven’t taken mine out and tried it yet, but admittedly I’m a little nervous to use the trial-and-error method with a device I’ve invested this much into.~Got my biki yesterday, playing around with it at the lake right now, still trying to figure out how to go below the water.~My Biki was just delivered less than an hour ago...so, I would imagine that others should be receiving theirs soon as well.~Hi, I'm backer 79 and didn't receive the Biki. How is it possible you already send 145 items and I didn't receive it?~Hi when will my item be shipped please? Thank you. A. Irish.~Faiz Azmi, what is your backer number?~Hi~Hi,~I think I've waited long enough for six months now!If you start shipping now, I think I will be able to get enough within a month!So if it does not arrive in one month, I will cancel my order!Quick action please! LOL~제발좀 빨리 보내줘~I can confirm I have received mine and are beginning to play with it.  Main issue is that the manual is confusing re getting the app to sync with Biki and while the app works, the controller doesnt seem to work. It is fully charged, makes a sound when pressed but biki doesnt respond.  How do I sync the controller to Biki?~When will the shipment be delivered? I don't know the delivery situation at all. Is it right to produce? Many people ask me to wait for a complaint.~So have they shipped or haven’t they shipped? You are being very vague with shipment details!  Please give us, your backers, a detailed description of what is going on. I can’t speak for everyone but I, for one, am very anxious to get this! Please come clean and tell us what exactly is happening!~#70 here - nothing either. Please advise.~",0.0,"$20,000",BIKI: First Bionic Wireless Underwater Fish Drone by Robosea — Kickstarter
52," Physically, TJ* is about 3/5 the size of my head, and he’s made of fiberboard (but he’s also available in colored plastic).  His eyes move up/down and left/right, and his mouth moves open/closed.  His moving parts are driven by 3 micro servos (tiny motors with position control circuits built in).By the time the Kickstarter campaign ends, TJ* will be ready to take home and play with, and ready to be on camera performing!  He awaits a new home with you, or a script to perform for you! Here's what TJ* looks like in my CAD model...
... and this is what TJ* looks like off the laser cutter.  I gave him some masking-tape-and-marker eyes.At his core, TJ* is a mechanical platfom with servos ready for electronic integration.   Don’t tell him, but he doesn’t have a brain - he needs a servo controller to run!  Fortunately for him, I’ve developed a controller using Arduino, the open-source microcontroller platform.A Complete TJ* Kit will ship with a brand-new Arduino Uno pre-loaded with code to run TJ* with the included puppeteer’s controller for his eyes and mouth.  TJ* will run with live control and record-playback functionality too!  You’ll be able to play with TJ* as soon as you power up his controller (see the FAQ below for how to plug him in).  If you’re interested in servo robotics, or if you already have an Arduino or other servo controller of your own, I’m happy to ship you a Maker’s TJ* Kit with the necessary connectors so you can start controlling him yourself.  Sample code to get him running will be available by the time you get your TJ* in hand!TJ* is a very talented performer - or at least he will be, in your hands! You can dress him up as much as you'd like, and record TJ* mouthing out monologues from your favorite movies, have him sit on top of your cookie jar and keep an eye out... or he can keep you company at work.If you don't want at TJ* of your own, you can watch him on TV... and by TV I mean YouTube, where he's hoping to have a channel someday soon.I bet you're right! If you like toys and technology, TJ* is for you.  Not only can you and your child decorate TJ* together, but you can show your child how cool technology can be. Use TJ* as a tech puppet and your child is all set to create a story with TJ*.  As your child grows older, you can introduce your child to the world of software tech by developing TJ*s programming together and have fun getting TJ* to do new and different things.Absolutely!For all options, you'll be able to select your color choices through a KickStarter survey once TJ* is funded!  I'm sure your TJ* will appreciate all of your efforts to make him look cool.  It'll do wonders for his self-esteem.Well. That’s another topic for another time. TJ* is ready to rock your world in his current form, but the next version, Emotive TJ*, will have two more servos. He’ll be able to smile/frown and raise/lower his brow. When you see that, I challenge you not to perceive feelings coming from his sensitive robot heart... err... microprocessor.",Jeff Kessler,"$40,281",Unstated,TJ* is an customizable robot performer / tech toy for you or your kids!

I really would like to my my kit before Halloween.~Any shipping updates?~has any one thought of making like a latex skin or anything for tj? I know i have but the only easy way i thing it could be done would be saran wrap tj and paint multiple layers of latex body paint. if any one has suggestions let me know.~Hello Jeff, any updates on the shipping date?~Tried using the upgrade store couple of times today but got forced out at payment time. Happened whether I used PayPal or credit card. Any advice on how to get through payment? You mentioned a password in your update but I was never prompted to enter it. Could that be the issue? Where do I enter it? Many thanks. Super excited about this project.~Hi Jeff,Received my survey!  Thanks, my daughter and I are both just a bit anixious to get the maker's kit so she and I can learn from it when she is off school in June.  You don't know how you are single handedly helping STEM Initiative!  Thank you so much!~Hi Jeff,I added extra money for the maker kit in my pledge so I could get it earlier when it was sorted out during the survey.  Does that mean I will not get my maker kit until the emotive TJ* ship in August?Thanks,John.~I did not receive a shipping survey yet, and I want a TJ* kit for electronics maker as well as the emotive TJ* + complete kit that I pledge for when it becomes available (all with plastic).  Will my shipping survey be sent soon?~Is anyone planning to use Raspberry Pi instead of Arduino? Should be possible, right?~Darn ... I didn't notice the LED eyes option until I got the shipping survey ... anyway I can add this?~I received an email asking for my shipping address, etc, but it didn't have a box to request the ""Fully Shaped TJ* Head Option"".  Is this going to be asked in a future email?~has any one thought about making like a ballistic gel/latex skin for it, i want to try and make it look as real as possible.~Great news..~how can I add plastic, face, and eyes to my 2 TJ's?~Get ready ... Count down Starts ... Awesome TJ .. Congratulations ! Jeff.~I'm excited!Congratulations!~Oh and the top pledge makes no mention of international shipping..~Hi Jeff, hope I did this right. Upped my pledge to $286 - that's what I need to do to get a skin for the first one right? The $30 pledge itself is unselectable (it says sold out), and I'm guessing is just there as a guide to what to add to your pledge?~Hi Jeff, thanks for the update. So, just to confirm, with the $256 pledge we get a skin for the later Emotive model, but no skin for the normal model? If we want one that's an extra $30. Regarding the fibreboard vs acrylic thing - other than aesthetic is there any functional difference? I mean, if we're going to put a skin on anyway is there any benefit to going acrylic? And, just want to say that this is a great project idea. I was actually wondering the other day as to whether anyone had done a kickstarter project on animatronic heads. With the rise of arduino and similar easy to use microcontrollers, it seems the age of accessible robotics is fast approaching. I am excited to see where this project ends up!~Hi Jeff, just a little unclear on what we need to do to get the paper skin, and what TJ will look like if we choose the acrylic option. I've made the top pledge, so I'm not sure if that makes a difference as far as extra payment is concerned.~""Rockit' the Cybernetic Drummer"" will soon have a face! He thanks you!~Amazing Jeff, can't help but think of Disney's Hall of Presidents (I'm showing my age) or the Tiki Room.Ever since I saw that as a kid I`ve wanted to be able to do this.Imagineering was my dream career.~Just a thought, but how about a future upgrade for pan and tilt.~How do you want the script and storyboard submitted?  Or when, rather?~Jeff;Will there be an upgrade kit for the emotive TJ*?Not a new puppet just the parts to upgrade TJ* to his more emotive state?~This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.~Awesome project! I will try to use TJ for puppeteering. Have you considered eyelids or eyebrows?~Thank you Jeff. I'll check those out!Cheers to you!~I'm excited about working on this with my son as well although I have no clue about electronics and robotics. I think my 11 year son is ready to take on the challenge. Also I'm hoping to have some fun with TJ* to hopefully make a video for my company. Your comment sparked some ideas of how I might use him. Is the acrylic available in orange? Nice project and kudos to you in your early success!~I was Stanford grad student (ee&cs) way back (62-64  & 71-73) and applaud your project.

[ Sep 7th ]Our project started with a need. We were educators in lack of a flexible teaching material for robotics. We were not satisfied by what was available at the market. It was clear that we needed to find a solution.We started prototyping robots by laser cutting acrylic and wiring some breadboard to it. Soon we were giving lessons and designing parts that could be changed from one place to other to match the functions needed from the robot being built.Experience at classroom lead us to keep things simple. The system has been used at primary schools, science experiments and even at industry level. So from these prototypes that we were laser cutting in our garage, we got something that had a big potential. The concept is that you get a box that has a kit inside. We took care of all the technical details in order for each single part to be compatible. Everything you need to build a robot is inside of the box. But you can also add your own parts...MECHANICAL PARTS: The result of what we have put together is a set of mechanical parts easy to assemble, difficult to break and simple to customize. The system is based in a mathematical relationship between dimensions of components, making them match each other. Below you can see a picture and a video of some of the parts that make a Multiplo Robot Building Kit.ROBOT BRAINS:  We decided to design and manufacture our own controller. Why? Because we wanted something user friendly, yet powerful and hackable. So here is the DuinoBot: an all-in-one robot controller with motor outputs, easy to use sensor connectors, plastic case and many more features. It's also expandable and 100% compatible with Arduino. Please read in the FAQ section for details.SOFTWARE: We know that it’s not easy to give the first steps into programming. For beginners, we handle in the controllers with a simple set of recorded actions to be commanded by a common TV remote control (please read the FAQ for details). If you are interested in learning programming, you might want to try our Graphical Software. It allows users with no previous experience in programming to start in no time. That software is also free and Open Source. It has been funded through a  KickStarter campaign as well. If you already know programming, you can use the Arduino IDE to program more sophisticated functions. EVERYTHING WORKING: ""Right out of the Box"" are the words we like to use about how you should start using your Multiplo Kit. There is no need to program, study a wiring diagram or buy tools. No soldering or protoboard needed. You can build a simple robot in about 45 minutes. Still you will be able to re-program it's controller, add Arduino-compatible shields like WiFi, GPS or your tailor made parts.TRULY OPEN SOURCE MECHANICS: The whole system is Open Source, but when making mechanical parts, the blueprints are not always enough. We also want to let the world know that we have designed each part in a way that it can be reproduced by simple tools. We want users to start making their own parts and share them in any fabrication workshop (we call this Fab Lab). We welcome people to hack, tweak, modify and improve the system. Read more at the FAQ section. COMPATIBLE AND EXPANDABLE: Our system  allows you to just plug in industry standard sensors. At the same time, our own sensors are also compatible with nearly any 3rd party robot controller. We specially encourage users to get either an original Arduino or any compatible board. There are several interesting options and we already give support to some of them. You can also get original Arduino(R) TinkerKit sensors, or third party compatible sensors. We will be adding support to more devices.FULLY DOCUMENTED: We had prepared pictorial assembly guides, video tutorials and a full set of examples. We will be posting them during the KickStarter Campaign. You can find some of the assembly guides that are currently being used at schools at our website. We are now a team that includes a teacher, two engineers and a specialist in robotics. We are very proud of sticking to our principles. We will keep our word of licensing 100% of our work free and Open Source.Our running costs as a small startup are expensive. We want to lower the price of our kits in order to flood the world with cheap and meaningful robots. But for that, we need to scale production. Our goal is to make this technology available to more people. Also to get other developers on board, people that also think that the world should be a better place and share things.  Even if we cannot make it at this KickStarter Campaign, we are releasing all the source files for free.We develop this system in order to prototype robots. But we ended inventing a platform to build things. We have been using it at public schools and it had proved to be suitable as teaching material. They are currently using it for STEM Education (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) for young students.Making a robot was a challenge some time ago and only few could have access to that. We want to reach a critical mass that allow us to break boundaries. We have found Arduino philosophy inspiring. We think that it's time that their concept spreads to other areas.We want our fully Open Source Robot Kit to get into hands of educators, artists and any kind of creative people.

Will I recieve my Multiplo someday or not?~Thanks for the diligence! Hopefully he'll get better results in person, sir.~@Tavares, same problem here. It's 6 weeks now and the status is not changing. It seems the Multiplo was ""sent"" via ship and this takes normaly up to 5-6 weeks. I don't know why it takes this long (packages left the outward office weeks before Chinese New Year) and I would recommend to send the Multiplo via Air mail.~To those waiting for tracking numbers - do not expect speed.

To this date, we have no kit, and have no idea when it is arriving and no ETA or schedule request for consulting with you on using your kit in our STEM program. I've posting this in a public comment as I had no reply to an inquiry made sometime ago. Where are we now.

Where do I stand?~MULTIPLO MULTIPLO MULTIPLO ! ! !~Hi,~Really liked the product and the box it comes it.  However, as the product was shipped from Shanghai (not the USA as expected) I got a customs bill for £22.42 that I was not too pleased about.~@Claudia: I have the same kit as you. I had built the 3 wheeled robot without much of a problem.  However, there were a few mistakes in the instructions, but they weren't too bad and I was able to figure out what needed to be done. Also, the instructions use all black plastic parts but te kit we're getting is white with some green.~OK.

55," In the beginning Roy did not start out as this crazy Animatroncs project he has become. My initial idea came to me a couple of years ago. I was inspired by all the amazing micro controller projects I was seeing online. These small extremely affordable Arduinos were being used by makers everywhere. But I started to notice that many of the projects were lacking cool mechanical hardware. That's when the thought hit me. Let the electrical guys build the circuits, let the programmers write the code and just do what I do best. Build cool mechanical creations. Since my greatest passion will always be  building mechanical puppets for films, I decided to head in that direction.My first task was to decide on a design style that would be affordable and easy to produce. I had used laser cutters before and was familiar with the incredible things they could create. So I made the decision to see just how far laser cut mechanics could be taken. With a used laser cutter and a stack of servos, I started my journey. First was a finger. Then that finger became a hand. That hand needed an arm and that arm needed......But wait, I wonder if I could do a full eye mechanism. Those eyes needed a place to go, so onto a skull I went. That skull needed a jaw to talk..... Well you can see where this is going. That brings us to the state Roy is in right now. He has two completed lower arms and a completed set of eyes. The skull and jaw still need some work. Everything else in the video is just some painted drain pipe assembled to hold all the parts where they go.Because Roy has turned into a much more complicated project than I had ever imagined (he is sporting 28 servos in the video with countless more to go). I have decided to break his offering into pieces. The idea has always been to get cool stuff into the hands of other people. I think a series of projects is my fastest way to do that. We are going to start with his hands and arms. If funding is successful, then we will move onto his eyes, from there it will go upper arm, shoulder and chest. When we are all said and done you will have a life sized Animatronic character to do your bidding.One of the most important parts of this project for me is the community I hope we can build. While this stuff is fun to build and interact with, the experience becomes so much better if you can share your work with like-minded people. Lets get some of those electrical guys/gals to build better servo controllers and the programmer guys/gals to write better animation software. I would love feedback on my designs. Maybe you know of a better servo controller than the one I have chosen. How can I improve my mechanisms? Let's get a dialog going.I decided to come to Kickstarter with this project because of the broad range of technical and creative people it seems to draw. There is no better place to offer such a unique project to such a large group of like-minded people. The funding that this project will generate will be used to help out the laser cutter I had mentioned. The laser tube in these machines have a limited life span and mine is unfortunately at its end. I would also like to stock up on materials and servos for the next stage of the project.Roy's Electronics Package ****NEW****




Roy's FingerRoy's HandRoy's ArmRoy's Arm DisplayWith the exception of the Roy's Ultimate Arm Display, all rewards come in kit form and do not include any control electronics. Why have I chosen not to include any control electronics? It goes back to my initial concept of the project, Supply cool mechanical systems for people to use with whatever controller they wish. For those of you who are not working with any particular electronics now or have never before, I will supply detailed descriptions to everything I used to get Roy moving like he is. Servo controllers, Wiring diagrams, Control software and so on.Since most of the rewards come as kits, I would like to talk a little about the construction techniques. Building one of Roy's kits will be very similar to building a wooden model airplane kit. Some parts will be glued, some will be bolted and others are captured in place free to rotate. Lets take the palm of the hand as an example:As you can see in the picture above the palm is made up of 10 individual laser cut pieces. How these pieces are assembled determines if you are building a right or left hand. Because we use a tab and slot design, the pieces automatically align when joined. The palm on the left has not been glued, but it holds together nicely because of the interlocking joints. The palm is the largest glued structure in the arm, it is amazingly strong and light.I will be creating a Lego style building instructions, along with video tutorials to help you along the way. Because of the self-aligning style of theses kits, the building is fairly easy. The most important part of the building process is patience. The full arm kit has over 100 laser cut pieces.Only simple tools required:I have been working on international shipping and have come up with the following:
USPS Priority Mail International Small Flat Rate Box - $12 additional Shipping.This box will ship the Roy's Finger reward or the Roy's Hand Reward.Tracking is not available for the small box. 
USPS Priority Mail International Medium Flat Rate Box - $37 additional Shipping.This box will ship the Roy's Finger, Roy's Hand, Roy's Arm or Roy's Arm Display reward. 
Tracking is available for the Medium box.Here is a link to one of the first animatronic hand projects I worked on about 10 years ago. http://youtu.be/_rGQZDYNpa4?t=54sUnfortunately the film was cancelled before we finished.Thank you for taking the time to explore my project.

56," Our
Kickstarter campaign is to develop a humanoid robotic hand and arm that is of
far lower cost than any other available. We believe that this will open up
robotics to a far wider market of makers and researchers than has ever been
possible. This should then trigger an explosion of creativity in the areas of
robotics, telepresence and ultimately prosthetics.Project background can be found at the Anthromod website.Photos of the printed prototypeHow you
will helpWith your
Kickstarter pledges we can take the prototype design and optimise it. Once the
campaign is over and the rewards delivered, we can move on to making the design
more functional, and add more methods of control. The wider community will then
have a standard for robot hand design. I am sure the community can come up with
uses that Easton and I could never have imagined before. By
pledging even a little you can receive part of the arm that will be functional.
You will even get models of the finger joints, so that you can make compatible
fingers. This means that you can start experimenting for low cost, before you
move on to the bigger and better models. You never know, someday improvements
that you make can be helping someone have a better life.Features
of the armCurrent features of the prototype·The arm and hand have 6 degrees of freedom that can
be actuated (1 thumb, 4 fingers and 1 wrist). The thumb has another degree of
freedom that can be set manually.·The arm uses a tendon system, with the movement being
provided by 5 Hobby Servos. 5 being the current number that can fit into the forearm.·Small elastic bands allow the joints to open and
close smoothly.·Easy assembly and repair. All parts can be removed
and fixed, should the need arise.·Off the shelf electronics. The arm uses arduinos and
commercial servo drivers.·Free software. The software to control the hand will
be posted online. This will allow control via PC, as well as other inputs (eg
control glove, EEG etc.). The source code will be open so that you can create
your own control systems.·Joint Models. We will upload models that will allow
you to make compatible fingers. This allows a great level of customisation,
where you can design and print your own fingers and have them work with the
hand.Steps
toward a better handWe have several improvements in mind, before we can
make a full blown prosthesis. If funding is successful we hope to add several
of them as stretch goals. ·Optimise electronics. Off the shelf hardware is more
expensive in the long run than custom built circuits, which can also be smaller
and power efficient.·Proprioception. Allowing the hand to know what position
it is in. Currently only servo position is known. Proprioception could be
achieved by strain or Hall effect sensors.·Sensors. Pressure sensors, temperature sensors or
even microphones could be added to give the hand a sense of touch.·Compliance. Controllable elastic elements in the
tendons, allow the hand to flexibly react to the environment.·Materials. We currently use ABS plastic, but Nylon
is a possibility as it can be lighter and stronger. Various grades of Nylon are
also biocompatible, which is a big step towards a prosthesis.·Degrees of freedom. Increasing movement of the thumb
and fingers to be more lifelike. The biggest obstacle to this is the control
complexity.·Bearings. Multiple small bearings rapidly increase
cost, but reduce wear and tear in the parts.·Control glove. Our current glove is based on a
Nintendo power glove, but future versions will be custom built from the ground
up. They will measure many more degrees of freedom of the hand and provide
greater control. Sensors from the hand could also provide feedback via the
glove.BackgroundFor clarity, Chris is based in Manchester (England), whilst Easton is based in Colorado (United States).EastonThere is
quite a story behind this. It all started when I was 14 and I had an idea for a
robotic hand controlled wirelessly by a glove. At the time I didn't know
anything about electronics or code so I started learning what I could on my
own. I started building a physical model and sewing flex sensors onto a glove.
The result was far better then I had in mind and it seemed like people liked
it:http://www.sparkfun.com/news/580I didn't
stop there. I wanted to make something more realistic and something that could
actually function. At the time I heard about 3d printers and looking into them
more and was determined to get my hands on one. I designed a 3d model of a robotic hand and ended up making the whole arm up to the shoulder. I qualified for the international science fair in Pittsburgh, PA where I placed 2nd in the world in engineering. I never imagined being a small town kid making something that people
cared about that much.When I
was at state science fair showing the arm to the public this 8 year old girl
came up and was in awe of the arm. I noticed she had a prosthetic arm that was
from the elbow to the fingertip and had one motion, open and close. I started
talking to her parents and they were talking about the cost of the prosthesis.
They said it was around $80,000 and because she is still growing that they will
have to buy a few more in the future. To me this was the ah-hah moment. I knew
I could easily adapt the arm for a human and make it function if not better then
the ones on the market. To me this is my end all goal and this is why I need
your support to find the very best materials, design, control system and making
it the most reliable prosthesis the common public can own. I am
already pretty far in development of the control system and some future design
for the actual prosthetic. I am using EEG and ECG as the primary control system
which combined is accurate and able to control with ease. Now you might be
thinking that yeah this is a good idea (hopefully) but it's a long shot. I am
very focused on what I do and only do the best. I have been featured in two
national magazine for the prototypes:http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2012-11/you-built-what-remote-controlled-robo-arm?single-page-view=truehttp://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to-plans/backyard-genius-2011-the-years-10-best-diy-creationsI also do
a lot of talks to the public and to the youth. I love inspiring others to learn
on your own and to make their dreams a reality. The other half to this is my
partner Chris.ChrisMy name is Chris Chappell. After studying at University I found myself trying to work out what to do with
my life. I knew that you were only young once, so you had to go for your dream,
or else time would slip away.I was fascinated by 3D Printing and could see how opening it up to the
masses was transformative. For 20 years expensive machines sat in corporate
basements, and only a few even knew they existed, but then came RepRap.
Suddenly anyone with a few hundred to $2000 could have a 3d printer. 7 years
later, dozens of companies, thousands of makers, and anyone who’s watched the
news over the last couple of years has heard of 3D printing. I looked around to see what else could be done. Now I was always interested in
building prosthetics, but they were very expensive. So how to lower the cost?
Well 3D printing was obviously the way to go. Building prosthetics involved
legal hurdles that I didn't have the resources to overcome. There were makers
though. Roboticists, researchers, telepresense system developers as well. All
people who would love to work in this area but aren't likely to spend the
tens of thousands demanded by the few companies that made robot hands. Now
expensive machines that are priced out of the range of the many people
interested in using them, where does that sound familiar? I had seen Easton's arm in an article over a year ago and had complimented
him on his work. He said he liked my work and for a while that was it. A few
months ago Easton got back in touch with me, mentioning an opportunity. In the
course of our conversation we realized that our skill-sets complimented each other perfectly. Together we could accomplish the design,
testing, and control that would take months and years to achieve otherwise. Together we developed the prototype that you can see in pictures and videos
on this page.My websiteMy Youtube channelSome articles about my work3D Printing IndustryBoingBoingProduction planOur plan is Chris to act as lead 
designer, whilst Easton prints, assembles the parts and programs the 
electronics. So far Easton has 2 printrbots, but if demand increases, 
more printers can be brought by either Easton or Chris to make up 
demand. As we both have experience in manufacturing these arms, as well 
as assembling electronics, if either of us has delays, the other can 
make up for it.ShippingOur
current plan is for shipping and assembly to all happen from within the United
States.  The Kickstarter is in pounds because of the age issue on Easton's end.

57," The gocupi project and source code were created by Brandon Green, the hardware was developed by Brandon Dunson. Both Green and Dunson are members of the Dallas Makerspace (dallasmakerspace.org). Without the community and resources of the Dallas Makerspace the gocupi project would not be what it is today.The guys at Eagle Circuits for being so helpful through this process. They made it a point to speak with us, confirm our projects needs, and optimize our order every chance they could. Of course PolyPrinter, the boys over at PolyPrinter know their business when it comes to 3D printers. They not only make a great printer, but the customer support is definitely a 5/5! We couldn't have done it without them, thanks guys.Tanner Electronics supplied most of the prototyping components but more importantly they are always willing to share their experience and knowledge with their customers. Thanks for all your help Jimmy and Jim Tanner!Do you have a need to robotically draw images on any vertical surface using a robot? Don't want to be limited by having to send gcode or commands to a tiny microcontroller that limits what you can draw? Then gocupi is exactly what you have been looking for!Using the processing power of a Raspberry Pi along with a custom designed backpack board that contains the necessary components to control two stepper motors (and optionally a pen up servo on the upgraded model) you can easily draw almost anything on any surface a pen can write on. Our suction cup based motor mounts allow you to deploy the system anywhere in a matter of minutes and start drawing immediately. Anything from whiteboards, windows, walls, billboards, to posters becomes your canvas.See UPDATE #3 for details.
The goal of the base board was to make it as cheap as possible for the end user, to do that we used through hole components and left all the assembly up to you. The two surface mount chips will be soldered in place for you but the rest is your responsibility. You will also need to wire the stepper motors to the base board on your own, there are male header pins included with the board, assuming you would use a 4 pin ""dupont"" connector on the stepper wire leads.The base board has the ability draw just as well as the upgraded board, it lacks the servo header and extra breakouts (unused ATMega328p pins) that are included on the upgraded PCB and the switching power supply. That means you will need to plug the Pi in as you normally would using the micro USB connector and connect the included +12v power supply to the base boards 2.1mm barrel jack.The main board is outfitted with surface mount components, a switching power supply that allows you to power the Pi via the gocupi using the included +12V DC power supply. This means no more plugging in a micro USB cable to power the Pi. It also has an ON/OFF toggle switch that will disconnect power to the gocupi main board as well as power to the Pi. All unused pins from the ATMega328P are broken out for your tinkering needs. The signals from the board to the stepper motors are carried over RJ45 (standard Ethernet cable) which uses only 4 of the 8 conductors, the other 4 are +3.3V, ground, and the last 2 are intended to be used as calibration sensors in future upgrades and have 10K pull-ups on the main board. There is a breakout for the servo, should you decide to mount one on the gondola. A breakout for an NRF24L01+ module is on the board for a future upgrade of wireless communication to the gondola eliminating the tethered servo wire.There is a plastic guard under the RJ45 connectors to prevent through hole leads on the bottom of the board from shorting to the Pi's USB and RJ45 shields.The abbreviated kit comes with:The lazy man's kit comes with:Gocupi uses the Raspberry Pi to run the go source code which does all the computation and sends data to an Atmel ATMega328p which then sends step and direction signals to two Allegro A3967's, one to drive each of the stepper motors. If those part numbers seem familiar to you... you may remember them from such devices as the ""Arduino Uno"" and the ""EasyDriver Motor Controller"" which were part of the original design. The Uno and EasyDriver boards were stripped of unneeded components and reconfigured to fit on top of the Raspberry Pi via the GPIO header. The original design required a solderless breadboard to connect all the hardware together which was difficult to assemble not to mention transport. Another common component was an ATX power supply which provided +5v for the Pi and +12v for the motors. The goal of the gocupi  hardware was to eliminate the prototyped circuits and reduce the number of components that the end user had to carry around. We have met these original goals and are moving on to some exciting new features, some of which are already a part of the gocupi project, some are still being tested and the rest are still a twinkle in our eye. We have been working with a hand full of beta testers that have helped us a great deal with developing a system that is easier for the beginner to use and also suggesting some features that we had not considered...stay tuned to the stretch goals to find out more about the upgrades. We need your help to accomplish the rest of our goals for the project, and maybe even incorporate some ideas of your own!",Brandon Dunson,"$10,704",Unstated,Gocupi includes hardware and software that allow your Raspberry Pi to be a polargraph of epic proportions.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,88 , I have a beta gocupi and love it! =)~,0.0,"$2,000",Gocupi turns your Raspberry Pi into a portable polargraph. by Brandon Dunson — Kickstarter
58,"  Thank you all for your support during the Kickstarter campaign !We now use Dynamixel servomotors on axis 5, 6, and grippers ! Check out this update to get to know more about it.Industrial robots improve every year. They become more powerful and more precise. However, their price is still very high and they are only available for big industrial factories. If you want to get a robotic arm for your home, your school, or your small company, you will have to spend between 20,000 $ and 200,000 $, and most companies will not even bother selling a robot to you.Our goal is to make robotics accessible for everyone. For us, accessible means two things : low cost and user friendly.We have the dream that everyone can learn robotics and have a better life with a desktop robotic arm.Niryo One is an accessible 6 axis robotic arm, made for makers, education, and small companies.  The robot is 3D printed and powered by Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Robot Operating System. STL files and code on the robot will be open source after the first shipments.Niryo One is also the first industrial-like robot, connected to your home and to the Internet !More than a product, we are building a complete set of cloud services around Niryo One, and a community around open source projects.We first developed Niryo One for makers and robotics enthusiasts.

  Having 6 axis, Niryo One can grab anything in its area, with any given orientationWith 6 axis, you can draw on a vertical board, or any non horizontal surface. In reality, the things you want to pick with your robot are not always on a flat surface, and on the ground. This is a huge limitation, but not for Niryo One. Most industrial robots (in car factories, for example) are 6 axis robotic arms, because they are the most efficient robots known for now. Having a six axis robotic arm, you can easily reproduce industrial use-cases, without having to sell your house or your car ! Endless number of applications are possible by using Niryo One.Pick and place objects with a suction pump, a gripper, or an electromagnet tool :Automate your 3D printer : Drill : Play with your kids : Hold a game contest : Get some help for cooking : With Niryo One, break the rules ! Make 2 robots working together :The great thing with Niryo One, is that the number of useful applications will always grow. We, on our side, develop as many as we can, so you will be able to do useful stuff, have fun, or learn.By being open source, we also let you, and the community, develop more use cases and functionalities ! We’d be very happy if we can work on his project, hand in hand with the community to make a product which is evolving with people needs.You want to create your own tool, adapt some parts on the code, add new piece of software to use with your product, and share with Niryo community ? Go ahead ! We strongly encourage people to do that. If you don’t feel like creating new features by yourself, you can also check out what other people invented.To encourage this, we will often organize contests, and expose the best projects created with Niryo One. If you want to contribute to the project, we will welcome your efforts and why not, add your new functionality in the robot. You can control Niryo One with many interfaces and tools. Everyone can find its way, from a child to an advanced developer.  Learning mode : Just move the robot around with your hands, it will then go to all saved positions (close loop control). A great way to teach the robot what to do, and when you don’t feel using a mobile or computer. This mode will also allow students and children to use Niryo One, 
without knowing anything about robots or computers. They can learn some 
basics mechanical principles, and get to know more about how robots are 
working. Control Niryo One with a joystick (xbox or playstation controller). You can choose position mode (x,y,z, and orientation of the end effector tool), or joint mode (control each axis independently)G-code (currently in development) :  Niryo One can also receive G-code instructions. It means you can use the robot as a CNC machine. This feature is currently being developed, and will be integrated as well in the web & mobile application.Web and mobile application :Control Niryo One directly with a web (any browser) or mobile (android, iOS) application. You can use it to replay some sequences, like the one that you saved with the “learning mode”.You can also create or modify you own movement sequence ! Just give some values to the robot (coordinates or joint angle) and the robot will move to the target point. You can easily adjust to reach the point you want, then save, and play it again and again.With the web and mobile interface you can modify a sequence of commands : change the order, add one step, modify values… You can also modify a lot of parameters on the robots, to get the most of it for each use case. Niryo One will be connected to your home using Wi-Fi. That means that you can control it wirelessly and from any part of your home ! But that doesn’t end there… We will deploy a cloud service (beta version in September) so your robot can be connected to the Internet. Web and mobile applications will be both connected to the robot and 
to the Internet (Niryo cloud service). That way you can switch from web 
to mobile, or mobile to web, and keep everything synchronized ! By
 using the Niryo mobile or web application, you can see, from all over 
the world, what is the state of your robot, and you can control it to do
 whatever you want. More freedom, more possibilities !You can share the program you created with the online community, 
so others can execute the same program on their Niryo One. You also have the possibility to download programs made by people around the world. Let’s say you want your robot to do a
 specific task, and someone already did that. The only thing you need to
 do is to download the program, launch it, and watch it happen !At first we will deploy a cloud service so you can :Share programs with other usersControl the robot from anywhere Plan your robot tasksStream video so you can remotely see tasks executionApply automatic and free software updates on the robotWe want to build this cloud service around people's needs, and take any suggestion to make it the best it can be. That’s why we will positively welcome any feedback from you. Beta version will be launched in September, and you'll get a free access to it if you pledge for a robot.If you purchase Niryo One you will get a free software upgrade every time we release a new core functionality. You robot will always improve over time !We will provide easy to follow instructions so everyone can assemble Niryo One. Depending on your maker skills, it can take between 1 and 3 hours to get your Niryo One standing and ready to use.Niryo One is a robot made by makers, for makers. We’ve created a reward category just for you ! By pledging for the Maker Kit (more info in “reward section” below), you’ll get a full Niryo One kit, without the 3D printed parts, so you can print them by yourself. Once kits are shipped you’ll get STL files, so you can fully customize your robot, and share your amazing looking Niryo One with us and the community !You will also be able to create new end effector tools, for even more use cases !Technology is everywhere. Children and students are more and more using new technology in school and everyday life.We want to help student learn about new technologies in fields like mechanical design, electronics, computer programming, artificial intelligence, ...We know that studying robotics with no robot is boring for students. You just learn some abstract concepts and don’t know what to do with them, or how they apply in real life robots.With Niryo One, we aim to provide a low cost robot for schools and universities, to teach new technologies, from mechanics to artificial intelligence. Students will be able to experiment on a real system, so they will learn faster as the learning path is more rewarding.Plus, this is also great for teaching some physics basics. You can learn concepts like gravity or inertia, and have a real experimentation to better understand those concepts. We also thought about children technological education. Maybe they don’t give much attention about physics and computer science yet. But they love playing with robots !Our children are, or will be surrounded by new technologies. Many 
schools are preparing for this, and already adapted their structure to 
give a better technology education.With Niryo One, kids will be 
more willing to discover new technologies. With the help of their 
parent, they can learn what is a robot, how it is working, and what it 
is used for.And that’s not all : they can use the web and mobile application to learn basic programming. We are integrating blockly in Niryo App, so children can learn programming with graphical blocks and see their program executed on the robot. We believe that programming on a real physical system is much more rewarding and helps people understand faster. If you want to go deeper and directly program on the robot, you can 
too ! Some users will prefer programming instead of using a pad or a web
 application.  Programming on the robot gives you more freedom. We will provide APIs at different levels :Arduino : if you just want to send program to the motors controllerRaspberry Pi with ROS : You will be able to program the robot using Python or C++You can get access to the Raspberry Pi 3 board with ssh, 
websockets, web server (all 3 with Wi-Fi connection), or bluetooth 
interface. We want to allow everyone, with different levels of skill, 
to develop on Niryo One.If you want to learn robotics with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and ROS, then you are in the right place !The
 code on the robot will be open source, so you can see what’s going on 
under the hood and how things are working on a real industrial-like 
robot. For more advanced users, you can also modify some parts, and share
 your progress with the community.You can also use a Python API 
to create your own scripts running directly on the robot, so you can 
learn robotics and customize Niryo One for any specific use case. We will 
provide a set of easy-to-use libraries.We will also set up an 
online forum, so you can interact with the Niryo community to find 
answers or to show the cool stuff you’ve made.Learn robotics with Arduino. Get to know how to :Control stepper and servo motorsAsynchronously handle external communication, sensors inputs, and actuator outputs Learn robotics with Raspberry Pi. Get to know how to :Program with Python and C++Use GPIO pins for sensors or actuatorsCommunicate with an Arduino boardUse communication protocols such as I2C, SPI or Serial When you want to learn or use ROS, you have two choices : get into a company or a university which has already bought an expensive robot, or use a simulation software, like Gazebo.In either way you don’t own the robot, so you can’t have full control, and using a robot in real life is much more interesting than in a simulator tool.With Niryo One, we give you a third option : get one industrial-like robot at home, with a complete ROS stack (using rosbridge, Moveit, …) running on the Raspberry Pi 3 board. The ROS code will be released after the first shipments of the product. You will have full access to it, for free. More info here about how we use ROS on Niryo One.You will be able to learn about ROS basics, how to communicate beetwen a non-ROS system (web application) and a ROS system, handle hardware control with ROS, motion planning, sensor data analyze, and many more.If we hit the Kickstarter goal, we will provide a complete set of Youtube tutorials to help you learn ROS with Niryo One. By doing this we want to bring accessible robots for ROS users, so you can learn faster, and with a real physical system. The structure of Niryo One is made out of 3D printed parts. At Niryo we do love 3D printing, it allows us to make more prototypes faster, so we can always improve and make the best possible final product.Here’s a shot of 5 prototypes before the current version. As you can see, a lot of improvements have been made over time :Here are all the parts included in Niryo One :We use 5 stepper motors to move the 4th first axis, and 2 servomotors to move the 5th and 6th axis. All axis are closed-loop controlled, using magnetic sensors for stepper motors, and analog input for servo motors. For example, this is very useful for the learning mode, so you can teach the robot what to do, and it can know itself its position at any time.Now comes the control of the robot. We use an Arduino Mega board with a RAMPS 1.4 shield to control and supply power to all the motors. On top of that, we added a Raspberry Pi 3 board. Why this board ? Well, the Raspberry Pi 3 is a real and complete computer. Arduino is a little bit limited when it comes to complicated computations. We run ROS (Robot Operating system) on the Raspberry PI 3 board to provide a simulation of the robot, advanced computations, and an interface to web and mobile applications. Moreover, the Raspberry Pi 3 board will allow Niryo One to be 100% autonomous. You will not need to always plug a computer to control the robot. It will be connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi, so you can control the robot from any place in the world.Niryo One’s repeatability is 0.5 mm, here’s a test we made : We’ve developed 7 tools you can use with Niryo One. You can easily switch a tool in less than 5 seconds. Just unplug, plug, and you’re ready to go ! (More info about the tools and how to get them below)     

  Shipping costs will be tacked on at checkout. Additional import duty or VAT may apply at time of delivery.We offer free shipping for France !When pledging to get a Niryo One, you also get a free gripper (gripper 1) !If you want to add one or multiple tools to your pledge, just add the required amount (shipment is free for tools). To do that, just click on “manage” after you have pledged.
After the end of this Kickstarter campaign, we’ll send you a survey so you can precise which tools (+quantity) you ordered. Just pick any tool, with any quantity, so you can fully customize your pledge !For 179 €, you get all the tools, and you save 41€ !Gripper 1 : (already included with each Niryo One)This gripper is perfect for picking objects with strength. This is a gripper which can handle a lot of standard manipulations.Specs : Gripper 2 :This gripper allows you to pick more larger objects. The 2 fingers always stay parallel, which ensure that the object won’t slide forward. You can also precisely pick tiny and more distant objects.Specs : Gripper 3 :With this gripper you can pick objects that are harder to pick with other kind of grippers, ex : round objects, cup of tea, apple, egg. You can be sure that the object will be smoothly picked and always in the center of the fingers. This gripper is perfect for dealing with fragile items, or when the shape is too uncommon. You can also pick hollow objects on the inside.Specs : Electromagnet grove :With this tool Niryo One can easily pick and place very small metallic pieces (multiple ones can be picked at the same time), which is very hard with any gripper, because grasping such pieces is not practical. Specs : Silent Vacuum Pump :A vacuum pump is very efficient for fast and reliable pick and place, and allows you to pick some objects that a normal gripper can’t pick. Ex : take out the cover of a flat box, move soda cans from the top, pick and place large objects with a flat surface. Most vacuum pumps are making so much noise, you just can’t stand and work near the robot, it is too disturbing. The pump we’ve developed is different : it's operating silently, with the same efficiency as a vacuum pump, for the same price. A servomotor actuates a syringe which pumps the air out. We’ve also made a custom Niryo box for this vacuum pump !Specs : Pen holder :The pen holder allows you to draw with any pen. You can easily adapt the tool to match the pen diameter. Niryo One can draw on any surface, with any orientation, thanks to its 6 axis.Specs : DC motor : (not for children)The DC motor allows you to add new functionalities to Niryo One : you can drill, sand down, etc. We provide 3 drill bits, you can use any other you already have in your workshop.Specs :  Get all the tools ! If you've pledged for the Maker Kit, you can also get an ""All the tools Maker Kit""If you want to support us, but not get the full robot, you can pledge less to get a mini-version of Niryo One ! Kids can have fun with this toy robot, and learn some basics.This robot has 4 axes with 4 small servo motors. It is powered by an ESP8266 board, which is Arduino compatible.A gripper also comes with Mini Niryo One.   If you want to add this mini robot along with your Niryo One pledge, add 119€ to your pledge ! (99€ for Maker Kit - only compatible with Maker Kit pledges)Notice : the gripper for the mini robot is not compatible with the robot Niryo One, and you can't add another tool for the mini robot.At Niryo we are huge lovers of open source. We don’t want to continue the game played by big industrial factories, that is, keep everything secret, and try to stay alone on top of the success.We strongly believe in open source projects. For us, this is a way to work together instead of staying alone. By sharing the work, together we can build a better product, and help each other to make technology better for people’s life, education and small companies.The STL files and the code powering the robot (on the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi) will thus be released with an open source license. For developers, that is a unique opportunity to learn robotics with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and ROS ! And for makers, Niryo One is everything you could dream of, with an open community, and tons of ways to customize the robot.We will also encourage the open source community around Niryo One by creating a forum and some nice contests. So you can find answers and show the cool robotics stuff you made to all robotics passionate guys around the world.We also have a blog where we share some robotics thoughts, tutorials, and Niryo news. We are French engineers who want to democratize robotics. We want to use the technical skills we have to make latest technologies accessible for everyone.  As makers ourself, we love 3D printing, Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Those are great to learn robotics, with the help of the online community. We want to go a step further, by embedding those technologies and electronics platforms in Niryo One, to show to the world that, yes, we can make a real useful product with 3D printing, Arduino and Raspberry Pi.Building a community of passionate people, helping students to learn robotics, introducing technology to children, giving more chances for small companies to compete in a tough market, are some of the goals we have.And we do not want to accomplish those goals alone. It’s not all about us. It’s about you and us, making a better project together, for the people who need it.We believe that we can make robotics accessible faster if we support each other.As we’ve already explained, Niryo is a community project. We are planning to be present online, with a forum, a github repository, more videos, some contests, some user showcases. For this, we need your help.

59," We build robots that fight other robots, in a competition called Mech Warfare (http://mech-warfare.com).We are a group of hobbyists, robotics engineers, students, and various humans that build small remotely piloted walking robots armed with airsoft, nerf, and even more powerful weapons such as micro-rockets, custom co2 powered bb rifles, and flame throwers. We take these robots, place them in a small-scale model urban environment and duke it out. Mech Warfare is part engineering competition, part ""real-world videogame"" with a strong emphasis on sharing knowledge, advancing robotics technology, and having fun. In our 4th year, we now have teams from across the United States, Canada, Mexico, and even Japan flying into Robogames in San Fransisco to compete each year. The last 3 years we've used a simple PVC pipe & canvas tent, which is inadequate for larger more powerful robots. Furthermore, we were fortunate enough to have a professional model making crew (Fonco Creative Services) do all of our scale buildings for the inside of the arena. While the internal environment looks very professional and well done, the canvas & PVC tent takes away from the immersion and overall aesthetic of the competition quite a bit, and we'd like to remedy this.We need Kickstarter's help because our robots are growing a bit too large and powerful to be hosted in a canvas tent. We need to build a lexan & aluminum armored arena to keep the robots safely confined within the arena, and keep the spectators on the outside safe from stray micro-rockets and BBs. If you've ever seen BattleBots, think of our arena as a smaller-scale version of theirs.We need to raise $6000 to build a modular, aluminum frame and lexan arena that is easily compacted and capable to be shipped/shared with other Mech Warfare competition groups popping up (we have a few so far). All of our 3D design plans for the arena will also be openly available for download to anyone interested. Any additional money raised beyond the cost of the arena will go into upgraded our networking equipment which allows us to stream live video feeds from the robots (used to remotely pilot the robots), displays for live 'mech-cam' feeds, and other various improvements for the arena and competition. As this is a non-profit, open source competition, we don't really have anything to physically build or much give away. We are however doing something that hasn't been done before, and something that we are very passionate about. There is no 'end goal' in mind for this competition, there is no profitable market product to create, we are inventors and tinkerers simply doing this because we love technology and learning. And robots. Because robots are awesome.With that said, we have in the past offered 'ad space' in the form of small advertisements, signage, building signs, etc, incorporated into our small-scale urban arena. For example, in previous years we've had miniature billboards featuring sponsor logos and websites, park benches with ads of them, and buildings named after other sponsors. We also have our friends over at Fonco (and Kickstarter Alumni) offering up some sweet MORAV based schwag. AND, we have friends in our community whipping up some pretty awesome Mech Warfare posters as well!This is a competition we have had a lot of fun building, and every year it grows in size and the number of people involved. The investment into this arena will help the competition grow for years to come. Thanks so much for reading and taking an interest.Update: Here's a peak at the Mech Warfare poster that backers of $25 or more will be receiving! This piece was done for us by an amazing artist, Søren Bendt.

60," To program a robot is simple. All that is required is to press the buttons on the top of  TurtlTeck.  By pressing the up or down buttons it makes the robot move either Forwards or Backwards by approximately 30CM. By pressing the Left or Right buttons it will then make the robot turn approximately 45° on the spot.An example program for a Octagon is the following:We understand that all robot chassis, motors and batteries are slightly different. To solve this issue we have added on 4 Dip Switches allowing you to increase or decrease the delay for that instruction. We have found that by setting the switches the robot can be fine tuned to work across different batteries and chassis.We have also designed the TurtlTeck to run fully off 1 pack of AA Batteries making it easy to power without the need for multiple packs, usb cables or extra regulators.TurtlTeck performing a squareWe are aiming to raise a total of £1000While we have the funds to be able to make a small batch of the TurtlTeck we are fundraising to be able to create a bigger batch; to help recover some of the development costs and buy new equipment to be able to manufacture them.One of the major things about running a fundraiser is also the fees taken by Kickstarter & Postage.

61,"      Algobrix teaches kids how to code by guiding them through the steps of programming a robot's movements. But instead of scripts to write, they have blocks to arrange, in a tangible way that's true to real coding. It's the awesomeness of robots, the lasting fun of building blocks, and the problem solving of 3D puzzles. It's Algobrix.      We set out to make coding accessible and tangible for kids everywhere by building code with LEGO™ compatible building blocks. And we couldn't be prouder of the result. It's comprehensive, patented, and just the best.Here’s why it's the best:Plus, there are awesome Algobots:         Instead of just teaching your kid to think like a programmer, Algobrix teaches kids to actually program a robot. Coding through bricks, not syntax.                Just like real code.       The Algobots can be programmed to move around, light up, and make sounds. Its sensors can react to light, noise, touch and proximity. Your kids have the option of building any of the Algobots to turn motors on, light up LEDs and play music.They're made from high quality LEGO™ compatible building blocks, so you can always expand your sets with your own LEGO™.        The Function blocks dictate what the Algobot will do. Your kid can program any of the Algobots to move around, make sounds, pause for a command (like clapping or being poked) or light up.Below you can see them with some of their corresponding parameter blocks.   The parameter blocks snap onto the function blocks and dictate how the Algobot will carry out the function. So if it’s a ‘light up’ function, you can add a 2 second parameter to have the bot light up for 2 seconds and a color parameter that tells the bot with which color to light up. Algobrix has built in error-detection and debugging. The blocks light up to indicate where in the process the bot is, with a red light to let you know if something is wrong.   Algobrix comes with activity cards (quantity depends on your choice of kit) which serve as missions for your kids to complete. And learn coding along the way.The cards are split up into 3 levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.    The activity boards lead your kids to program their bots in specific ways, and challenge them to follow through. The City Challenge: Find your way home across the urban jungle while following road signs  The Space Challenge: Milky Way Tour: Navigate through Space (and then in the dark!)   The Road Trip Challenge: Safely travel across continents      *Colors may vary Our Educational PhilosophyEducation + Entertainment = Edutainment At Algobrix we believe in enhancing children’s educational processes while developing their ability to learn. While we understand that each child possesses a unique learning style, we have found that both fun and excitement accelerates their comprehension, retention, and analysis of new information. We have meticulously developed a tangible programming language, which combines education and entertainment using an interactive teaching method. At Algobrix, our mission is to establish an original and unparalleled approach to educating the engineers and scientists of tomorrow by creating a well-known, engaging educational experience they can enjoy at an early age.  With Algobrix, children are empowered to build their confidence as they enter the challenging field of STEM, taking with them a necessary set of skills and knowledge attained through our hands-on learning method. Additionally, Algobrix is implementing two learning methods: The Spiral Learning Method and the PBL Method.Our open source philosophy extends into our product's compatibilities, and we wanted to fit right in with some of the things your kid already has at home, that's why Algobrix is made from high quality LEGO™ compatible building blocks, so you can always expand your sets with your own LEGO™.      As veterans in the fields of education and technology, our confidence stems from multiple areas of success and personal passions. As die-hard LEGO™ fans, we chose to combine our individual talents to create Algobrix and enhance the learning experience. Amir Asor, founder of Young Engineers, has 10 years of pedagogical practice of teaching STEM with building blocks and Danny Eizicovits, PhD. has a decade of research and teaching experience in the field of robotics.Young Engineers, an education company that quickly expanded across over 40 countries worldwide, provided us with the knowledge vital to approaching children of different backgrounds and cultures when teaching them how to code or program using LEGO™ compatible bricks. Our previous experience with Young Engineer projects helps Algobrix with the necessary tools and manufacturer relationships to assemble a high-quality, and most importantly safe, product that consists of internal electronic parts and external plastic encasements. Our ability to reach children both intellectually and kinesthetically is one that has matured over time, allowing us to create a fun, learning space that leaves a lasting impression on their young minds as they begin to think like engineers and become acquainted with programming.     Tross is a data-driven crowdfunding companyFounded in 2008 by CEO and Co-Founder Amir Asor, Young Engineers is a global network of educators teaching children STEM with LEGOs (and similar building bricks) across over 40 countries. Young Engineers teaches multidisciplinary engineering to kids from 4 to 14 years old with a focus on fun, accessible, and hands-on engineering.  With a focus on early intervention, Young Engineers breathes passion into the dreams of young engineers and scientists. With an original and unmatched approach to engaging young people, Young Engineers enables kids to think outside the box and propel them into a future of programming.       ",Algobrix,"$1,153,514",Unstated,The most exciting and comprehensive code learning game for kids 5-13.

What good did it do me to back you up more than 6 months ago...~Why is Algobrix selling the products similar to kickstarter pricing on their own website? Please take into account that no one wants to support the funding if later on the same is sold for the same price online!~Dear Algobrix,~Hello Algobrix team!~Oh, and Algobrix is selling the products similar to kickstarter pricing on their own wbsite???~I back some other projects in KickStarter and this is the biggest amount I ever pledged for something I consider an innovation.  As an educator, I see the potential benefits a child gets from a set of Algobrix.  That was 9 months ago, and I have waited patiently with the first few indications of delay - sure, people need time to get the prototype in production - that's what we saw in the Algobrix Kickstarter video - showing kids playing happily with real parts that moved and blinked - need changes to make it better - fine but when you need 9 months and more, which is what it looks like now, Algobrix should respect the wishes of backers who want a full refund and issue the refund immediately ~I wish to get a refund too -  I did not post before as I wanted to give Algobrix a chance to deliver - but the delay is so long and there are already many products in the market that is very similar by now -  Algobrix is also not doing much for early backers to compensate them for waiting patiently~I requested a refund and was told that it cannot happen at this stage. My son -that algobrix was intended for- will have outgrown the product by the time it arrives. This is my 3rd bad experience with crowdfunding so far and I am getting a bit dissolutioned with it. This is getting a bit ridiculous.~Dear @Algobrix, I think the project is outstandingly worth every effort, and am willing to wait until it’s properly done. Quality over rush. ~Hi,~I believe this is a wonderful project but I also would like to get a refund. Please send me the refund process via private message. Thank you very much.~Hello. I would like a refund please. I may consider buying the product once it is released.~@ErinAshley, thanks for the crowdfunding 101. I’m inexperienced with crowdfunding indeed and this is my first project on KS - you are absolutely right that KS is about taking risks of potential delay/failure in exchange of cheaper pricing. But this project only gives the risk not the benefit - whoever enters the deal now pays exactly the same as what early backers paid a while ago. Shouldn’t the project team at least adopt a progressive pricing plan or give early backers extra benefits to compensate their time value of money and reward their patience? $300-400 is not a lot to many but may be one of the most luxurious gifts a family would give to their kids with the most beautiful wishes - why don’t you tell them that a project who’s 20x over-backed not only doubles the wait time and gives whoever enters at late stage exactly the same benefits.~Helll - can you also send me the refund arrangement? My family will be relocating in Sept so the product won’t fit our schedule / education needs / situation anymore with the delay and god-knows-when timing. I like the philosophy of the product so I will consider buying when the final product is on the market~Hi, mayI get a refund on my purchase?  I may buy once this thing is released.  Thank you.~If we want to get a refund on our backing/purchase, how do we go about it? So far this will have missed being a Christmas present & birthday present for my daughter & I think this is aimed at younger children so she possibly won’t get as much use out of it now. It’ll be coming up to 12 months since backing & shipping was due... it wouldn’t be as big of a concern but this is $400 of product that we have no real idea when we will receive if.~Hi, my husband and I backed 2 sets as birthay presents for our niece (May) and son (June). Unfortunately, it seems rather definite that neither of them will be receiving any Algobrix for their birthday.~HelloWe have moved house since I backed this project. Will you be checking address deliveries before you send out the product or is there somewhere I can change the original information I entered?thanks~Hi,~Hi,  I have waited for too long, way pass BOTH of my kids birthday and promised dates. Please refund me!~@Danny. Hi, I am Backer 2007, pledged the Ultimate Kit. I am thankful for your monthly updates and sharing with us your team's progress and manufacturing challenges. I'd rather have a delayed delivery than a rushed mass production, missing out on thorough testing of parts. That will help save on a lot of 'after-sales' service and upkeep your company's reputation. Keep up the good work and I enjoyed the video clips.😃~Hi teamIn February 18 I asked you if it was possible to provide  us in advance with the cards design under an open source format in order to (1) translate in French (or any other language) and (2) prepare stickers to change the language for my kids~Hi Team~@Rebecca,You have made so very bold claims about ponzi schemes and are attempting to rile up other backers, in what I can only assume is inexperience with kickstarter. ~Hi Team,~It’s a great product but I agree with everyone it is unfair that you kept our backing money more than half a year than originally expected. Considering the exchange rate and interest rate, it is unfair to all the KS backers especially now you are still selling for the same price - the typical red alarms for a Ponzi scheme.~Hi I believe you when you are saying you are working as fast and as hard possible. I am a 100% with you. I think it is a great product and I am not worried that it is delayed given the complexity of the task to put such a product together. I am just saying that the fairly sparse news and an absence of a ETA could make people grumpy as I can see from the comments. You have published 8 updates in total but 2 were published before the end of the kickstarter.So for backers, since the project has been funded mid-september, we got only 6 updates. ETA was moved from February 2018 to June 2018. Then somewhere in the comments, I learned that June 2018 is not an ETA for shipping or receiving the product but an estimated time for the beginning of production. I love your product, I really enjoy the technical parts in the updates, but a bit more transparency on the timing would be highly appreciated.Best~The campaign pages still says delivery for Feb '18.  I know you're still working on it, but do you have an updated ETA?  Are you a month or two out or 18 months out?  Seems like you're pretty far removed from a deliverable product based on the updates you've provided?~Hi Algobrixyou claim to post updates once a month, but it is a bit less than that (7 month since end of kickstarter and only 6 updates). Having more frequent updates might decrease the grumpiness and worry of some backers. I think it is especially important when a project is delayed by a few months. Best~what a scam! It got it for my nephew's b'day. They were living in Canada then. B'day is gone months ago and they have relocated to another country.~Hi! I haven’t seen any recent updates and I’m curious if you have begun sending out kits! I can’t wait to play with these with my son.~Hi Algobrix Team,~This is a great project tats why i support it at the very beginning. The set of algobrix is meant for my niece's birthday gift while her birthday has been passed for more than a month now and i hv bought something else for her. Till now there is no expected delivery date so far, plz kindly let me know the refund logistics, thanks.

64," We are developing Protei : a low-cost open-source oil collecting robot that autonomously sails upwind, intercepting oil sheens going downwind. Protei combines conventional technologies in an innovative design that we can implement in the short term to address timely environmental crisis such as the BP Oil Spill, cleaning the ocean gyre garbage patches or performing ocean research. We need your help to build our next prototype of Protei - the first articulated sailing boat that can tack upwind pulling a long heavy payload and initiating a revolutionary family in ocean robotics. http://protei.org A situation we must change Current Oil spill skimming technology was able to collect only 3% of the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. The health of remediation workers was compromised by exposure to cancerous toxic chemicals, skimming boats themselves contributed to pollution and were expensive to power, operations were constrained by daily weather conditions and were limited by proximity to the coast. 
In contrast, Protei aims to be : unmanned, unrestrained by human biological needs; green and affordable; self-righting and therefore operable even in hurricane conditions; semi-autonomous, so that far offshore, many Protei would be able to intelligently and continuously swarm.Observations and ideas from testing  Spilled oil moves downwind from its source following surface currents. Traditional oil skimmers pull oil-absorbent booms and trace random linear paths in a sea of oil. But a better way to capture this oil is to sail upwind, intercepting the oil sheens traveling downwind. Protei harnesses the wind in order to power an unmanned sailing drone, pulling a long oil-absorbent ‘tail’ upwind. A fleet of many Protei will work automatically as a swarm, or be remotely controlled by coastal residents and on-line gamers. When you pull a long heavy object behind a traditional sailboat, the center of gravity is altered such that in order to preserve navigability it becomes necessary to redesign the relationship of hull, keel, and rudder. The solution we found is to design an entirely articulated sailing boat that curves when it tacks upwind. Building and testing consecutive prototypes with multiple sails, we soon realized that Protei's hull bending would expose both sides of the vessel to the wind when tacking upwind, continuously catching wind with the different sails, increasing power and control - and creating a totally new way of sailing! 
We also found out that an inflatable body would make Protei featherweight for a very large sail surface : an excellent power ratio. Inflatable means also cheaper and collision-safe. Version after version, we keep improving the design and discovering new properties. Versions   - Protei_001 : front steering, Remote Controlled.  - Protei_002 : articulated sailboat, Remote Controlled.  - Protei_003 : articulated inflatable sailboat, lightweight and larger sail surface, good power ratio.  - Protei_004 : electric, swarm for display, art.  - Protei_005 : electronic, on-board sensors and micro-chip control, wireless real-time communication and monitored with webcam to analyze trajectory. What the money is for   - Protei_006 : We need money to build our next prototype at full scale to measure the performances : 
* how much oil can be absorbed. 
* how much floating plastic debris we can collect from the ocean garbage patches. 
* how much weight of scientific payload we can transport for ocean studies and exploration.  
This next prototype will be packed with electronics and sensors: micro-controllers, GPS, long range wireless communication, solar panel, wind turbine, accelerometers, anemometer, pressure gauges, batteries, servo/step motors, winches etc. Many of us will gather 3 months this summer in Rotterdam (Netherlands) to build our next prototype and publish the full online documentation so others can build their own versions too. Deploy Oil spills are happening all the time across the world. In many of these locations, access to effective yet inexpensive remediation technology is lacking. Thus, Protei is Open Hardware so anyone can use, modify, and distribute Protei. Currently Protei is being developed as a team effort by Open_Sailing in the UK and France, V2_ in the Netherlands, randomwalks in South Korea, Amorphica in the US and Mexico and contributors from all around the world. If you cannot back us, you can work with us :)Protei is the plural for Proteus, Greek sea-god and son of Poseidon. Proteus was known for his mutability, his capability of assuming many forms. The word protean evokes flexibility, versatility and adaptability. The machine we are developing now is Protei for collecting spilled oil at sea, but being an open source project, other versions may be designed in the future for other purposes : to harvest the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, to capture heavy metal pollutants in coastal areas, extract toxic contaminants from urban waterways, perform oceanographic research, monitor marine life etc. We hope that developing Protei Open Hardware will contribute to ocean studies and pollution remediation.

65,"  ""RSE has delivered proof of the Guardian in action and is currently testing it in Bermuda, where Rizzi and team are navigating it around the waters in search of lionfish this week.""- TechCrunch“You see these beautiful boats sailing around Bermuda, and underneath them there’s this pretty horrific environmental catastrophe underway with this lionfish invasion, so I think it brings the community of people who are passionate about the ocean together.”- The New York Times“With advances in wireless technology, we can actually have an app where people pay to go hunt lionfish and capture the fish by remotely operating the robot ... if robots can catch lionfish, a new market in which chefs can turn an environmental hazard into gourmet cuisine might emerge.""- Fortune         1) 6-Degree of Freedom Navigation System – 8 thruster array for total motion control, allowing complex hunting maneuvers and stabilization of undersea currents.2) Stunning Panels – Low, controlled voltage temporarily stuns the lionfish long enough to be captured.3) Electronics Enclosure – Pressure vessel containing open source microcontroller, autopilot module, communication node, motor controllers, and main camera. This vessel also contains the system's sensors including leak detection, depth, and 3-DOF gyro.4) Surface Tether – 100m tether for control and communication with surface power.5) Power Enclosure – Module containing on-board batteries, or an adapter for surface power and tether.6) Capture System – A thruster captures and holds lionfish in the chamber. This chamber holds up to 50lbs of lionfish to make each diving session impactful.7) Main Body – The robot body is 8” in diameter and allows for agile underwater movement. Since their accidental introduction over 25 years ago, lionfish have relentlessly invaded the western Atlantic, devouring over 100 different species of reef fish and crustaceans around Florida, throughout the Caribbean and Bermuda. An indiscriminate and voracious predator, one lionfish can reduce the fish biomass on a reef by 80 percent in just one month. It is now considered by marine biologists as a top threat to the Atlantic marine ecosystem along with climate change and ocean acidification.The unsolved disaster resulting from the infestation of lionfish in the western Atlantic begs for new ideas and a new approach. To be effective, the solution needs to be widely deployable and be economically self-sustaining. It needs to be able to reach large lionfish populations deep underwater, as well as guard reefs from infestation. The operators must be non-professionals who can deploy and maintain the solution without extensive training. All these requirements can be met with properly designed, manufactured, and deployed underwater robots.  RSE is running a crowdfunding campaign for two reasons: to raise awareness about the urgent environmental threat posed by the invasive lionfish, and secondly to get their revolutionary Guardian LF1 submersible robot into the hands of users who can enjoy catching the fish and doing good for the environment at the same time. Our Formula Is Simple: in order to truly impact the lionfish population there will need to be a lot of robots in the water hunting and capturing the fish wherever they are. The Guardian LF1 device is driven by a controller similar to a gaming controller, and is very user-friendly and lightweight at about 20 pounds. This device is special because it is the first to reach, stun, and capture lionfish that are found very deep below safe depths for diving. At this depth, lionfish reproduce quickly and unchecked by any predators - causing havoc for reefs and fish ecosystems. Once captured, the lionfish may be cooked for a tasty meal or sold!    The Guardian LF1 undersea robot consists of two main components: an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with an innovative capture mechanism, tethered to a remote surface control station. The underwater ROV is deployed from the ocean surface to seek out lionfish which can be located up to several hundred feet below safe sport diver depth. An operator at the surface controls the Guardian LF1 movements via a game controller locating and capturing lionfish. Eight separate thrusters mounted on the ROV enable it to move smoothly in all planes of motion and maintain position regardless of undersea currents using an onboard autopilot.Once a lionfish has been identified by the operator, through cameras and lights on the ROV, a pair of electrodes mounted on the ROV are used to apply a small electric current to the water near the fish. The operator safely controls the application of this low voltage alternating electric current, activating it for a very short period to stun and immobilize the fish. Similar technology is used regularly by marine biologists in freshwater to humanely capture and release fish unharmed. The RSE team collaborated with experts in the field of electrofishing to adapt this technology for use in saltwater. As soon as the lionfish is immobilized, it is quickly suctioned into a containment vessel on the ROV. An innovative suctioning system was especially designed by the RSE engineering team that requires minimal power while producing a strong flow to draw in the stunned fish. A single robot can capture up to 10 lionfish before returning to the surface. The design is modular which will allow future versions to hold more or fewer fish.  To apply robotic technology to solving large-scale environmental challenges and to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers through our efforts. There is boundless potential for robotic technology to address environmental catastrophes. Recognizing this, Colin Angle, chairman, CEO and founder of iRobot and Erika Angle, Founder and Executive Director of Science From Scientists, have founded Robots in Service of the Environment (RSE). RSE is an independent non-profit organization, not affiliated with iRobot, that is focused on developing robots to solve environmental problems. Started with initial funding from the Anthropocene Institute, Schmidt Marine Technology Partners and the Angle Family, the non-profit's first initiative is to develop an undersea robot to slow the destruction caused by lionfish, an invasive species drastically reducing biodiversity and coral reef health in all warm waters of the western Atlantic. By combining technology development with mass manufacturing techniques, RSE offers a unique set of capabilities to solve some of the world's most challenging environmental problems on a massive scale.     Thank you for supporting our campaign to make the Atlantic ocean lionfish-free!

67," Here at PiBorg, we love robots, we love rovers, we love controlling motors and we love the Raspberry Pi!This Kickstarter is for a powerful 5 Amp motor controller that you can use with the Raspberry Pi to make bigger and more awesome robots. We’ve also made a chunky metal rover robot to push it to its limits. Introducing the ThunderBorg motor controller and the MonsterBorg robot.Making robots is hugely educational, and the ThunderBorg controller and MonsterBorg robot have been built to suit all skill levels. The ThunderBorg controller is supplied with an array of software to interface to the Raspberry Pi and to control the MonsterBorg robot. It can be used via game controllers and joysticks like a remote control car, through a web-based browser like a spy-bot to creep up on your friends, and it can also be controlled autonomously using self-driving code. The robotic possibilities are endless!Rover robots are becoming extremely popular in education and the maker community. They can be used for all sorts of applications.We’re no strangers to making robots as you may know from our DoodleBorg robot, or from our Formula Pi standard robot – the YetiBorg.Getting your robot running in RC mode is the first step and this is loads of fun, but then it’s only a bit more complicated to control it from another room or even from the other side of the world. Once you have mastered that, you can investigate the world of autonomous robotics and make your robot do something really special.Included with the robot is access to several examples for this including ball following code and self-driving robot race code.From there who knows? Perhaps add GPS/GSM to deliver a pizza to a friends’ house? The sky is the limit!We thought an apt name for our new robot was MonsterBorg. We chose this 
name as the robot has really powerful and super robust motors, huge 10.5cm 
(4”) diameter wheels and a very impressive battery life – we recorded 3 
hours!!!The MonsterBorg can be programmed as a self-driving robot, 
used for education about self-driving systems, or raced around the 
garden as an RC off-roader. It also makes a great platform for hacking 
about with robots by adding extra sensors or servos.FeaturesThe MonsterBorg kit comes with the wires, screws, motors, hubs and wheels that you need to get it running. You need just add a Raspberry Pi, a micro SD card, 10 AA batteries, and an optional Pi camera. A Phillips (cross head) screwdriver is needed for assembly. The ThunderBorg is a dual motor controller for use with a Raspberry Pi. It is an upgraded version of our very popular PicoBorg Reverse motor controller.We’ve improved it by adding on-board voltage monitoring, an RGB LED, a built in DCDC converter, and all this in a format just larger than a Raspberry Pi Zero. It mounts directly on to your Raspberry Pi. The ThunderBorg allows controlling of speed in forward and in reverse via its PWM output. You can daisy chain them with optional cables to control up to 100 motors.It controls 2 DC motors per board and has a powerful 5 amp per motor continuous rating.  Each board will alternatively control a 4 wire stepper. You can drive more than 2 motors by connecting motors in parallel or adding more ThunderBorgs in a daisy chain.It has protection features including over-current protection, short circuit protection, over temperature protection and under-voltage lockout. That makes it the perfect Raspberry Pi motor controller for most DC motors – whether they are tiny or huge.Just plug the ThunderBorg into your Raspberry Pi, motors and connect a battery supply or DC source (from 7-36V), and you are ready to control motors. Easily connect an external battery pack via the power connectorsThe ThunderBorg has a built in DCDC regulator which powers the Raspberry Pi from your battery source (7-36V)Controlling DC motors from your Raspberry Pi is made very simple with the ThunderBorg! You can use the RGB LED for endless indications such as voltage monitoring, CPU load level or even displaying ping times.ThunderBorg is easily daisy-chainable to add on extra motors. One controller has a Raspberry Pi Zero mounted on top of it. All three motor controllers are separately addressable from this Pi, so you can easily control individual motor outputs.The ThunderBorg works with all Raspberry Pi’s.   ThunderBorg is controlled via I2C pins, so you can control it from any device that supports I2C and 3.3V logic levels. A 10xAA battery pack is a common way to power your robot, and we’ve designed an additional lid to allow batteries to neatly be attached to the ThunderBorg This specially designed lid comes with a 10xAA battery pack, a switch and an additional RGB LED to sit on top of your ThunderBorg. It comes with a battery holder for 10xAA batteries (batteries not included) and provides ample power for most projects. This powered the MonsterBorg driving on our track for over 3 hours!It comes with an on/off switch, a second RGB LED and a soldered connector to the ThunderBorg. In all rewards which include a ThunderBorg Lid, you will be given the option of having these unsoldered if you wish.Raspberry Pi Zero, ThunderBorg and ThunderBorg LidWe’re trying to ship both the ThunderBorg and ThunderBorg lids out as quickly as possible after the Kickstarter ends, so it’s likely these will be available before the MonsterBorg robot kits ship. The MonsterBorg kits we will ship as soon as possible, but with chassis laser cutting, assembling kits and ordering parts from all over the world, we expect that these won’t ship until June. We will ship them earlier if we can.The MonsterBorg, ThunderBorg and ThunderBorg Lid are subject to slight changes – for example, component colours, mounting post lengths etc. This is because at the time when we go to purchase parts for them, some things might be unavailable in the quantities we need.Please note Raspberry Pi, Pi camera, SD card and batteries are NOT INCLUDED in any of the rewards. The MonsterBorg, ThunderBorg and ThunderBorg Lid were all designed by us here at PiBorg. Designing robots and circuit boards is our ""bread and butter"".Originally we designed the MonsterBorg robot with our PTC-Creo CAD system, and the ThunderBorg with our Altium designer package.Milling out one of the several prototypes we made to develop MonsterBorg We have a considerable amount of software which will help you get started with the ThunderBorg and MonsterBorg.With simple GUI software for driving motors and also libraries to control from Python, you can get controlling motors and flashing LEDs quickly.The inbuilt voltage monitoring and LED makes a great battery level indicator – this is the default configuration.You can set the LED how you like via an easy to use GUI or using our verbose software library.Easily control the ultra-bright RGB LED on ThunderBorg which is great for status information or robot underlighting :)You might have seen our two previous Kickstarters.ZeroBorg - a robot controller for the RaspberryPi Zero which had 340 backers and was 714% funded! Formula Pi – An autonomous race series for the Raspberry Pi using the Pi Zero, the ZeroBorg and a YetiBorg 4 wheeled autonomous robot. This was 347% funded by 106 backers!In both of these projects, we managed to make the shipping dates, and we’re confident we can do this again.If you saw our previous Kickstarter for Formula Pi – Self driving robot racing with the Raspberry Pi, you probably know we run a race series for self-driving robots. The first race series was fantastic! We had competitors ranging from parents and children, a Scout group from Germany, professional programmers and even a team who met working in Formula One.We’d love to use the MonsterBorg and Pi3 in a Formula Pi series, and if this Kickstarter is successful, we will do so. It would also allow us to buy more cameras (we’d love to have 2 more viewing angles) and keep supplying great race footage live.Upgrading the Robots will make the competition faster, more flexible and more competitive.We want the ability to run much longer races, and thanks to the extended battery life we can!More processing power from the Pi 3 will help to make neural networks and self-learning code easier to use. Formula Pi, MonsterBorg and ThunderBorg make an excellent platform to get started with self-driving vehicles. As the standard code and tutorials use OpenCV, they are an excellent resource to learn about how computers see the world. The competitive nature encourages continuous experimenting with the code, and this makes the learning exciting. The feedback from trying your code is very visual and it’s easy to become hooked. The code can easily be adapted to more complicated control and AI software such as ROS and TensorFlow, and this is perfect to progress toward real world autonomous vehicles.We are in talks with educational institutions about using Formula Pi as part of their self-driving course curriculum. If you or your school/University are interested in this, please contact us. We’d also like to run a separate event for education.

68," You love creating. And robots. And things that go fast. Kamigami is the lightning-fast robot that you build as a project with your daughter, son, or for yourself, and it’s a blast along the way. And when you’re done building, you teach your Kamigami new games through our drag-and drop programming interface. It's so easy, an 8 year old can do it. We’re all about creativity at Kamigami robots, and we know you are too.Grab your smartphone or tablet, and download our free app to get started. You'll be racing your Kamigami around, building games, and having fun with friends in no time. It's easy for anyone 8 and up to go from creating simple programs in our drag-and-drop interface to building single player and multi-robot interactive games, such as: 
 Check out how you make a Kamigami robot - in high speed!  Kamigami robots are built from a unique, patent-pending material (an extremely durable plastic composite) that allows them to fold up in an origami-like process.Our kit comes with everything you need to build and run your own Kamigami robot. This includes the laser-cut body components, as well as the motor, transmission, rechargeable battery, micro-USB and plug-and-play electronics. 
The assembly should take less than an hour.  We will have videos online with instructions to show you how it all comes together. Kamigami robots are controlled through our free mobile app (for iOS and Android) which you can download to your smartphone or tablet. For a full list of compatible devices and operating systems, please see our Frequently Asked Questions below. There are three Kamigami robots to choose from — Musubi, Inari, and Goki — each with their own unique appearance! Once assembled, your Kamigami robot is ready to go and will be running around at top speed in no time.  See what Kamigami robots can really do — build a Kamigami ramp, make your own obstacle course over all sorts of terrain, or race your friends to see who can get the fastest time. Kamigami robots are designed to run like the world’s fastest animals. Biologists have discovered that all animals feature an alternating gait — whether they have two legs, four, six, or more. We’ve baked this into Kamigami by building a linkage that alternates the up and down motion of each leg. The circular motion of the motors is turned into elliptical motion of the legs through these linkages. By doing this, we get a leg pattern very similar to real animals!

Another important part of animal locomotion is how springy or stiff the legs are relative to the size and mass of the animal’s body. Almost all animals have the same leg stiffness when scaled to their mass. We’ve made sure Kamigami hold true to this principle, allowing them to run swiftly and efficiently.

Now, how do the mechanics of everything work?

There are 3 main components of the Kamigami robots: Chassis (or Body), Electronics, Gearbox and Motors.The chassis is composed entirely of flexible hinges, also called flexure joints, which have lots of advantages over traditional joints, including:It’s these flexure joints that give Kamigami their unique origami nature.The chassis snaps together using these simple pop rivets.And voila!The infrared emitter and detectors allow Kamigami to send signals to each other, and know where they’re receiving them from. A signal might be “tag, you’re it” or “spin and light your eyes” or “send this message to the mobile device controlling you.” This allows for the development of swarm robotics in the future as multiple robots communicate and react to each other.The electronics also come with a rechargeable battery attached, so you don’t have to run to the store before running your robots. Battery life is about 30-45 minutes of play time and recharges in about the same amount of time.


The gearbox is made up of two motors, six gears, and a housing to locate everything. The gearbox is connected to the electronics through a process called heat-staking, and the electronics and gearbox come as a single piece.  The motors are 6mm diameter coreless brushed motors, similar to what you’d find in a small RC helicopter. The gearbox provides a 16:1 reduction so that the Kamigami can charge over tough obstacles.We're manufacturing Kamigami in the USA. We believe this leads to the best quality, communication, and time to market possible.The chassis, electronics, and gearbox are all built in different ways. The chassis is laser cut, using a patent pending multi-step process that involves lamination, alignment, and roll-to-roll manufacturing. Check out a real-time video below:For prototyping we use a slower laser in our lab that allows us to try out new designs every day. Our robot’s electronics are made by… another robot! This is called a pick-and-place machine, and it uses computer vision to pick up, place, and solder each tiny component onto each board. The gearbox features gears made of injection molded nylon, and a gearbox made of injection molded ABS plastic. These are all custom parts. Our motors and pins are “off the shelf.”We believe in building with your hands — that engineering is not separate from emotion. We believe in STEM education for everyone — that creating is for everyone. So we created Kamigami: lightning-fast, origami-style robots you can build, program, play with and evolve. During the past year, we shared our robots with local schools and camps and the response was overwhelming. And now we want to share them with everyone!

 Kamigami is brought to you by an awesome bunch of people. Nick and Andrew are the co-founders and old climbing buddies who met while working in a robotics lab at UC Berkeley. Dwight, our hardware engineer, joined soon after the company got started and is a fellow Berkeley alum, who comes out of the biology department where he and his labmates study animal locomotion.

 Polly is the Head of Marketing and makes sure everyone knows how awesome Kamigami robots are. Adam is our Software Product Lead, combining a mastery of coding, UI/UX, and design skills to build a killer app and an amazing play and programming experience. 

Kelvin Nguyen is our industrial and graphic designer, so if you like the art on the page, or the Kamigami characters, you have him to thank! 

We've been working on developing Kamigami for a long time now, and have experience manufacturing, having already shipped 1300 Beta robots in 2014. Here's what we have today.

 We will be shipping our first 1,000 units in January 2016.  The remaining units will be shipped in March 2016.  We will be shipping to the United States and Canada. After the project ends, we will send you an email with a form to validate your shipping information.  At this time, you will be able to select the Kamigami robot of your choice. Thank you for your support!","Dash Robotics, Inc.","$60,710",Unstated,"Lightning-fast robots you can build, program and evolve.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,697 ," We've received and assembled our bot.

If you don't reach 1,000 of the $59 ones by the end, will you ship any of the other ones in January?Also, just curious, can you put digital file of the character shell template up, so we can create our own?I told all of the tech teachers I know, posted on Twitter, and on ISTE communities. I really hope this gets funded! :-)~Please share with your friends - https://www.facebook.com/kamigamitoyrobots/~Any chance to get them before christmas, so I can give it out as a present?~Have I correctly understood that there was a TED talk about the robots? Could we get a link to it?~@Creator..Why there is no option for International Shipping?? I live in Dubai, United Arab Emirates...Any chance to get this...please reply asap as early birds are disappearing fast!~Can you make a pink one? Or one that looks a bit cuddly and like a pet? My niece would love this, but if I give her one that looks like the ones in the video she'll ask me why I gave her a boy's toy. (I've learned from prior birthday presents I gave her that had blue/red-type theme colors.) There are very few toys that teach STEM skills and are targeted towards girls, and I've already given her all the GoldieBlox sets!

Is there any chance I might get this by Xmas? Shipping to Canada by the way.~I got the Bluetooth working, the problem appears to be with the mainboard switch. I have to flick it on and off several times to get the Arduino to fire up. Once the Arduino starts the BT lights up and all is good. Although when I use the Get Up command Roby flips right over on his face. He also wants to keep going forward when he should remain in place. The distance sensor does not seem to be active. The black socket head bolts were used to attach the arms to the servos. I am impressed with the quality of the printing and general design of Roby. The cables could be a bit softer. Once the kinks are out he will be a fun learning and teaching tool.~Hey Donald, There should have been two longer socket bolts (black) and locking nuts in the parts bag. I can ship you another set and replace you Bluetooth board. If you do not mind can your open a support ticket on the site (it will help me keep organized). Please go to http://sociallyshaped.com/support/~I received my Roby Standard last week got it assembled but was missing parts to attach idler (front) wheels. Also the bluetooth board seems to be DOA. There is no light on the board and connecting is not successful.~I have still not received my Roby.~Hey Ying- Hau Sun, I am glad you got your Roby, but really sorry your package is missing a part.  Can you confirm it's the Arduino Micro (green board) or the Breakout Board (where you would insert the ethernet cables)you are missing (the link you sent can not be displayed). Once confirm I will ship a replacement part right away.  Lastly the course; ""How to build a Roby Standard"" has links in the main and each lesson that go to a PDF with step by step instructions.   I will work on making it easier to see the links tonight.  Here is a direct link to the assembley pdf http://2m6xaw48uyze5onei3bjpta9.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Roby-Assembly.pdf  I will also be working on better training documents and videos when I get all the Robys shipped.  Also, I will be creating a support system and FAQ over the Thanks Giving Holiday.  Thanks for your Support! Have Fun!~I received my Roby today.  Thanks!~Tring,tring,tring, wake-UP  please,Sinse October - 1 - 2 015 GREAT Silence.When I seearch for any specifications or documentation about Roby nothing to find or is all  that  part of the contents of the deliverypacket?

For the Roby-standard I need I think first a Raspberry-Pi and a pallet to control it.Hoping I will meet Roby soon maybee this week,~Hello Wonderful Backer Steve, We should have all the Roby Standards shipped by tomorrow/Monday and then we will start the Roby Genius which is 60% printed, so should be done by the end of Nov. Roby Jrs are the last to be printed and packaged so I will likely start the first week of December and have them all sent out by Dec 14th.  At present, it's a one man show - so please bare with me as I am putting in 12 hour days to get your Roby in your hands.~Hello, I've also funded this program originally, can you please let me know when can I received my Roby? Thank you.~Hi @creator. I funded Roby Genuis. In your campain, you has written it will delivery on August 2015. But now is November already. Can you tell me exactly when it will stay at my home. You can not delay and delay a lot of time, and a lot of months.~Hey Wonderful Backer Marckosvl,We are just finishing shipping the first batch of Roby Standards this week.  We should be able to start shipping the Roby Genius next week.  Thanks for all of your support!~@Creator, can you provide an idea for the timeline of the Roby Genius?~Thanks Susan, ~Hi @creator please can you be a little more clear on when we can expect our Roby? Will they all be shipped by the end of November? End of December? Thanks.~Thanks Tony,We are shipping Roby Standards now and will start the Roby Genius when we get our Raspberry Pi's that are on back order. ~Mm. Only two months behind.  Is it possible to get a refund?~Thanks Hans,Yes i do! Looking at the que report, yours should be there by mid November!~Hallo,Wil it be posible that I have my Rob y  on november 29 2015?  On this date I can have space for a demo again.~Hey Wonderful backers.  We are building and shipping as fast as we can:)  Note: International Shipments will take longer than domestic. The 30 dollar international shipping charge is 2-3 weeks according to USPS.  We wake up everyday working on the Roby platform, and we hope you enjoy it and help the community improve it.  Right now the one thing we need to improve is our parts manufactures whom we rely on:).  This unfortunately is the life of a small business, but we will get better faster with more experience!~Where's Roby? :)~You are ready to Ship?how do we send you the delivery address?I have already missed my small boys birthday. he eagerly awaits  Neil~Thanks Tran Phuoc Thien,~I buy Roby Genius robotic kit for Early Birds. In your Campaign, you write it will delivery to me at August 2015. But up to now is September 2015, I do not yet receive your product. Would you please tell me when your product is ready and avaiable to delivery to me ? I am hurry to play with your robotic.:) :) :)~Thanks Hans, We will post another update with the bad and good news for everyone as you recommend, and send a copy to everyones email.Note: We had an issue with our mail servers during August 7-14 (issues with our MX record on the Godaddy DNS server, so I believe I missed your questions but here are the answers: 1.) We will include all RJ45 cables. 2.) I do not think it would be proper to share everyones email, BUT we are also working on a collaborative environment at SociallyShaped.com (now in pre-beta).  In this environment, you will be able to interact with all backers of the Kickstarter in a special group with access to files and designs based on the community's creativity. This will be available to everyone shortly. ~Hey fellows,Every body asleep over there or so bussy that there is no time to inform us.Let us hear something badnews is also information.Half August is gone and we know not more than July 1st.Wake up so that we can start also.Groetjes,Hans~Hello John,No I haven't received any update or comment directly in  my mail. If it is not to much troubel a direct link is a very good thing. Is it possible to show the  list of backers?Still an other querstion. Those  RJ45 cabels are they included in the set or must  I  make them? GroetjesHans~Thanks Hans,We sent out an update yesterday, that included pictures of the new boards/IO.  Did you not receive it?  Let me know if you have any questions or if you are having issues receiving our updates through Kickstarter's system, as I can open up a support ticket.~Hey Guy's,~Thanks Hans van der,  We are still targeting shipping in August, but can not guarantee shipping dates per order yet.  You should be able to reassemble Roby a few times - but likely some of the parts will wear in the process as some ""snaped"" in.  The time to put together Roby depends on the model and your skill level...but an average range is 45 min to 2.5 hours.  Lastly we would LOVE to have you promote Roby in shows.  I will reach out directly to do what we can to support you!~Thanks for your feedback Keith! We should be able to give everyone an update on the boards/shield soon and would love your input.~I see you guys said you might use a custom board, I say just use readily available parts.  Dont want delays, and most people dont like proprietary boards.~Hallo John,August coming closer so do You have a idee when I can expect my kit and how long :it takes to build Roby? Once build can it be taken down and rebuild?Is it allowed that I promote the project here in Belgium bij showing Roby, on a computerfair in dif ferent  towns?The first will be  Antwerpen  September 6th 2015 .~Hey Kem,Thanks for reaching out! As a Kickstarter backer you will get access to all the content (videos, instructions, etc). Just know that while we will do our best to go above and beyond for our first backers - support for future Roby customers will be limited to what you purchased.  Let me know if you have any additional questions!~Hello Keith. Question for you. I have the Roby Standard robotic kit for Early Birds on order. Since I have (2) Pi 2's with screen and wifi, I am hoping that there will be instructions included for using our components to the Genius robotics kit. I realize there are more parts, but I have most of them too.Thanks~@ Hans van der Puijl: Thanks so much for your support!  We are super exited to get Roby's out to everyone!  We have several backers from the EU so you are well represented!~Hello John,Congratulations We  did it. I kept my fingers crossed after the 100000 but the last week was wondevrfull.?. Being a 'worldwide' backer I would know how many there are and from Erope.Hoping August comes soon,GroetjesHans van der Puijl Belgium~Hey Keith, It was great meeting you at the National Maker Faire! We really appreciate your support and great discussion! Great idea on the share button, we will investigate how to implement it!~Hello Toben Blalock,~Hi Guys, met you guys at National Maker Faire, I was the gentlemen trying to win a Roby and talked to you about me being a backer.  I was even more impressed after seeing Roby in person.  Excellent job!  I just up my pledge even to the next level to help you out.  You guys need to create easily share buttons to retweet about your campaign.  Good luck and hope you make.  I can say, I think all the backers will be happy with this little robot, especially the one with RPi 2/Display.~Which versions of Roby can be programmed with Scratch?~Thanks Tim, Yes, it is possible to race two robots. A different ‘name’ must be used in the firmware for both the Roby(standard, genius, or junior) and rf remote. We will make a video on how to program your unique name as a learning opportunity when we launch.~Is it possible to have a kit of two or more of the small / inexpensive robots with remotes such that both robots could be controller without affecting the other ones, say competitive obstacle courses? How many could you race against at once? What sensor readings can you get back while controlling a given robot? (ie bluetooth/nfc based check points, wheel encoder for dead reckoning, etc.)~My kids can't wait -- let's go Roby!~I have a MakerBot Rep 2x in my school MakerSpace. (Junk, I know) but I'm looking to get a better one.~Hey Andrew and Loganblue Dan,~@Creator -~Will there be an option to get just the kit sans 3D printed parts but get the design files? I'd like to use something like this for teaching, but it's way too expensive to buy multiple kits when I can 3D print my own parts.~",0.0,"$25,000",3D Printed Educational Robotic Platform Roby by Socially Shaped — Kickstarter
70," Dorna is a fast, powerful and precise robotic arm. Dorna is an industrial grade 5-axis robotic arm with an open source software and firmware, and it is capable of automating many real life tasks. Dorna provides a perfect solution for business owners, makers, researchers, artists and anyone who wants to get serious in robotics without spending a fortune on an industrial robotic arm. 
The robotic arms with specs similar to Dorna, are usually out of the price range for most consumers. With Dorna we have tried to change the standard for affordable robotic arms. Full metallic body makes Dorna sturdy, powerful and jitter free in fast motions. Precise machining processes used in building Dorna, make it highly accurate and repeatable. With powerful microcontroller and firmware, Dorna can perform complex and fast multi-axis motions.Being able to design your own tools or modify the existing tools and quickly attach them to Dorna, provides a great amount of flexibility for Dorna users. We have designed a simple adapter interface which quickly and securely attaches different tools to your Dorna robotic arm. Dorna Lab is our software library for controlling Dorna. Dorna Lab runs on Windows, Mac or Linux OS and is completely open source. Dorna Lab is a GUI based software, which provides scripting and command line control options for working with Dorna.  Dorna Lab is developed with Python and can be used as a standalone application or integrated as a library with other applications.    
The graphical simulator also helps you to visualize and evaluate your scripts before running them on Dorna. Given the performance of Dorna, its easy tool change mechanism, and open source software, the applications are only limited by your imagination. As a business owner, researcher, maker, artist, or a student, you can find many applications in your day to day life, that Dorna can be programmed to do them for you faster, more reliably and more efficiently. Here we have few examples:Camera Man Dorna can help you capture smooth and dynamic shots. Dorna can easily handle a DSLR camera even when it is fully extended and perform complex slow or fast multi-axis motions.Assistant ChefOur founder originally started Dorna mainly as a robot for help in kitchen. Although later Dorna evolved into a more capable robotic arm, you can still use it with the difficult and repetitive food making tasks in your kitchen.Lab AssistantWhether you are a researcher, science teacher, or an industrial user, you can have Dorna perform unsafe or labor intensive lab experiments, accurately and efficiently.Laser EngravingDorna has a very high resolution (0.005"") and can be easily implemented as a laser engraver or with other toolheads for drawing and painting. Computer Vision and Machine LearningWith an open source library, you can easily integrate Dorna in your machine learning applications. You can also make Dorna more intelligent by attaching a camera to its base. Pick and PlaceGiven the high payload capacity (2.5 lbs), and great repeatability of Dorna (0.001""), you can use it in repetitive industrial pick and place applications.  Dorna is made out of aerospace grade aluminum for its rigidity and lightweight. High quality steel bearing, shafts, and aluminum pulleys, make it able to perform smooth motion under large payload. To get the most out of our stepper motors, we use powerful stepper drivers which enable stepper motors to maintain their torque at higher speeds. Furthermore, we use highly efficient, heavy duty timing pulley and timing belts, as the main power transmission mechanism in Dorna. Despite its light weight, Dorna can easily handle 2.5 lbs of weight, even at its full extension, which is significant, compared to other robotic arms in similar price range.Dorna can achieve up to 0.005"" resolution and 0.001"" in repeatability, making it a great fit for demanding industrial or scientific applications. Multiple factors contribute to the high resolution and repeatability of Dorna: Dorna achieves high speed of up to 150 deg / sec for the arms and 300 deg / sec for the base and the wrist, while maintaining a smooth motion profile, even when all 5 axes are moving together. Beside the mechanical properties, the important factor in achieving smooth and fast coordinated motions in Dorna is the use of highly optimized 6-axis  g2core firmware for running Dorna, on the fast Arduino Due based controller board.
Dorna uses Arduino Due based controller. Running at 84 MHz, Arduino Due is the fastest Arduino microcontroller with 32-bit ARM based cpu and 54 digital I/O and 12 analog input pins.We use g2Core, open source 6-axis CNC controller, as the firmware for controlling Dorna. G2Core can generate extremely stable and jitter free step pulses at up to 200 KHz for running stepper motors. In addition, g2core performs jerk controlled, 3rd degree motion planning which results in smooth start-stop motion profiles of the robot arm even under heavy loads.We are a team of two brothers with PhD degrees in electrical engineering and extensive industrial background. Our journey with Dorna began more than 5 years ago when the older brother, Sadegh, always a robot enthusiast, came up with the idea of building a fully automated robotic chef, where you make the raw material available to the robot and the robot will process and cook it based on the provided recipe. After making couple of initial prototypes, he decided to use similar ideas and build a more general robotic arm, which not only can cook food, but can also be programmed for helping with other real life tasks. The problem with the existing robots in the market was that, they were either very expensive, or if affordable, they were not capable enough to replace humans in complex tasks. The current version of Dorna, is the result of many rounds of iterations and prototyping and we now think that it is the right time to offer Dorna to the world and see how others are going to apply it in their applications.",Dorna Robotics,"$71,935",Unstated,An affordable industrial grade 5-axis robotic arm with open source software and firmware.

71," mDrawBot is a 4-in-1 drawing robot kit, it can be assembled into 4 different configuration drawing robots: mScara, mSpider, mEggBot and mCar. Reported by: Haxlr8r, TechCrunch, Xataka, Atmel, SlashGear, geeky-gadgets, technabobThis kit consists of Makeblock parts and we also designed a powerful software named mDraw to control these robots. mDrawBot contains over 60 components (and countless screws and nuts), here's the picture of all the components.mScara is a SCARA (Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm) driven by stepper motors. If you install a pen on mScara, it can draw pictures on a flat surface. Replacing the pen with a laser diode, it can turn into a desktop laser engraver.mSpider is a drawing robot which can draw pictures on a wall or a white board. Two stepper motors control the movement of mSpider though strings. Theoretically, it can draw in a huge range by increasing the length of strings.mEggBot is designed to draw on things that are improbable to print on, such as eggs or ping-pong balls. It can be used to write letters or to draw expressions on eggs, or to draw Easter eggs.mCar is a three-wheel robot car. It contains two stepper motor drive wheels and a ball caster wheel. It can draw its own movement tracks on the surface. If you install a chalk instead of a pen, it can draw on the floor.Each mDrawBot kit can be assembled into any of the 4 different configurations. We provide the detailed assembling instructions and you can build any configuration in an hour. The assembly instructions can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Makeblock-official/mDrawBot.You can also use your own Aruduino UNO instead of Makeblock Orion. The wiring may be a little complicated, but it works well.After installing the mDraw software, you can import images and make the robot draw them. mDraw is a powerful software designed for mDrawBot. Here are some features:mDraw is an open source project hosted on Github. Fork it here:https://github.com/Makeblock-official/mDrawBot.mDrawBot is a drawbot (or 4 drawbots), and it's more than a drawbot. You can re-use the Makeblock robot parts in countless new projects and it's easy to extend the kit with new parts. Here are some examples of what you could do:We also provide 2 upgrade packs for mDrawBot: the bluetooth module and the laser engraver pack (500mW).WARNING: Please wear appropriate eye protection when using laser pack. The laser may produce toxic fumes with some certain materials. Make sure the good air ventilation of the working area. Keep it away from children and other people who are not familiar with using laser pack.You can also design your own upgrade pack for your mDrawBot. By adding an accelerometer and gyro sensor, it can become a two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle. Add some additional Makeblock mechanical parts and it may transform into a XY plotter. The only limit is your imagination.mDrawBot is created by the Makeblock team. Makeblock is an aluminum extrusion based construction platform that can bring your creations to life. With Makeblock you can make professional and solid robots, machines or even art projects. Imagination is your only limitation.We're located in the Maker City - Shenzhen, and we are passionate about our product. We believe in the ideology of open source technology. We're open to share and we hope you can share with us.Contact us: info@makeblock.ccWe are using crowdfunding to get market validation and quick feedback that will help to expedite our research & development.

Any chance to have tracking number ?~Received my mdrawbot last week and building the mscara at the moment �~Thank you for the status update, that was the information I needed.~@Creator - thanks, I sent e-mail for you now. If it fails, then same information is writen to Kickstarters private message board.~I am also having a lack of communication problem. I backed for “mDrawBot with a Bluetooth Module”.I send a KS message on May 22nd that I did not receive a “Bluetooth Module” with my package.On May 24th  they responded “Hello Larry. We'll check. Sorry about that.”On June 3rd I sent a message to support that I had not heard anything, could you please give me a status update.As of the message I still have not got a response. I understand that there could have been a problem with the shipment and it could take a couple of weeks to receive a replacement part. But the lack of communications is not what I expected form this company. Please give me a status update.~I’m sorry and I don’t want to write it in this wall, but what other I can do? I have tried contact with MakeBlock via Kickstarter messages and sent two e-mails to their support and info addresses.  Four days and no answers. :(~@Anders: Have you tried cloning the repository from https://github.com/Makeblock-official/mDrawBot and simply starting mDrawGui/robot_gui.py in there?~Are there anyone who have run this from Linux?  I will try Wine myself later.By the way, are there any thoughts of describing the software, as I might try to clone and make a Linux version of it. That is, what external programs needed and how they are used by the program.  As it is written in Python, it might not be impossible to do.Anyway, any report on Linux experiences are welcome. :-)~@makeblock yes~Hello, I've got my mDrawBot kit days ago. But one of the Beam0324-184 is bended.~We built mSpider yesterday as our first try with mDrawBot. The instructions are great and easy to follow. We were able to get it working, but only after finally finding the note in the docs about raising the torque of the stepper motors with the tiny screw on the motor controller boards. Until we did that, the motors did not have enough power to reel in the string and mSpider only went down and not up! Once we figured it out it is very cool!~Hi, I received an email that most of the backer have received the product. But I haven't. Could you check that for me?~There are two issues with my order:First of all i didn't receive a tracking number. Secondly we were confronted by the DHL delivery guy with paying 200€ for costums and fees, just for the $179 kit. How is that possible?We didn't had the money at home, so the DHL guy disappered and he left no information about the parcel. At the moment i can't organize a second delivery. I need the tracking number first.~My package arrived in good shape. I was pleased I didn't have any additional customs or shipping fees. The system is nicely packaged and put together. Everything seems to be there and its nice they included extra screws. I really like the way the Arduino clone has been designed. The color markings and RJ connectors make it easier when working with kids. Now comes the fun part. I have started to playing around with the various pieces of software from Makeblock. It can be a challenge to figure the different packages they have and which piece works with what hardware.  It is quite powerful but somewhat buggy. I am using Github to report problems. I found the mobile application lacking.~@Robbo:  Thanks.  I parked by the river and opened my package in a hurry - must have missed it.~@creator~@Ehud~Hi Creator,Arrived today in good shape but there is no inventory sheet (referred to in the manual).  Can you post a PDF of the inventory?  The books looks full but it is my habit to check parts when they arrive.~Hi Creator,~@Creator Great package, it's easy and fun to build the robots. Unfortunately I've received only one timing belt in the box, so I can't build mScara, and can't try out the laser engraver. :( I've took out everything from the box, even the foam, but there's no sign of the second one. Could you please ship it?~Got it! Will assemble tonight. So fast shipping and everything seems in order. Love!~I suppose you are sending laser and Bluetooth module separately form the standard package . Is this correct? I received standar puck but not  laser bluettooth add.~@Creator no offense but you did meet this problem, just check forums on your website (person there made a video of this problem)... I tried every suggestion there, and yes I checked the screws few times.~I haven't got my product yet, could you send me the tracking #?~Just got mine. Surprised because I did not expect to receive it too early.54 € tax and 17 € administration fee for DHL.... Totaling 72 € / about 80 $.~Did you get a ""shipment sent"" notification. I unfortunately did not. Or have shipments to Austria not have been sent? Or did they go to Australia, hope not.~Anyone got mScara to draw line without shaking? I'm not sure what else to do, my mScara draws in zig zag pattern..  tried to change speed, motor power , checked twice if I did not miss a screw no change. MScara drawing like this is useless.~@Stockwell Haines With the mScara, the only way I could get it to work was to position the drawing at 12'0 clock with the arm at rest at 9 o clock (x = -373, y = 0) position. It looks like the algorithm is a very crude implementation of inverse kinematics with no test for wrong direction movement or collision with self.@creator, you mscara firmware needs to be improved. You should either limit the drawing area or add the capability for it to detect that the robot is running into itself. Otherwise it is a very frustrating product.~Got ours today. No extra charges. Thank goodness because what they charged up front was quite a lot. Box looks great can't wait to put it together.~I got an email indicating my shipment was ""hung"" due to address issues, and a suggestion to call DHL, but no tracking number.  Please provide a tracking number ASAP!~Got it love it. Found the laser connector cable had to have a connector attached to one end. However the instructions only show it attached with no comment on polarity. After I opened up the box I could see a full wave bridge rectifier, meaning polarity didn't matter for this cable. Hook it up and plug it in.~@Stockwell Haines ""I am a little confused because my arm seems to bend the opposite direction I would have expected"". I believe the answer to this question is to reverse the direction of the incorrect motor. For this there is a little gear icon next to the scara select that will allow you to change the setting.~mDraw for MAC crashes on my Macbook Air 10.8.5, also the PC version under Parallells crashes. Anyone else with the same problems and knowing a trick to solve it ?~I can not get it working. on a mac. after opening the program. connection success, when I hit update firmware the only message is download failed. anybody any ideas? the rest seems fine but I am stuck. nothing in the readme files.~Thank you Makeblock! my reward came earlier than expected! you have really got it together! makeblock is an example of how crowdfunding should be.~@Creator Really thanks a lot! I used a substitute, so I don't need it separately. However I am still confusing about CH340...I read whole solutions in forum and tried it. But I can't get CH340 driver yet. I really want to start it!!!~@Creator - I just got and put together the Scara... I am a little confused because my arm seems to bend the opposite direction I would have expected. (Often times causing the first motor to run into the stand. The other issue I am having is that it is very shaky. I was not expecting pristine writing, but this is not even legible. Perhaps my problems are related though. Another note is that the pen up/down can not be within 5 of each other. When I used 70/60 respectively it picked up the pen in tests, but not when drawing. For other plotters I have used the solution is to either make the values closer together or increase the motor speed... neither seem to be available though. ~@Jacob - if you go into System Preferences -> Security & Privacy you can enable opening of just mDraw app without turning off your security feature for all apps. If you go to SP right after you try to open mDraw and get the not signed error message you'll see an option to just allow that app. Just in case you didn't know already and for others that don't know.~",0.0,"$50,000",mDrawBot: 4-in-1 Drawing Robot by Makeblock — Kickstarter

I went ahead and ordered a pro! My sons birthday is in June so that's gonna hopefully make for a pretty sweet birthday gift! Appreciate all the work you guys have put into the creation of such a wonderful product!~Will the platinum set also include the smartphone mounts, like in the other Phiro Pro sets? That would be phantastic together with Pocket Code in schools! Most kids nowadays already have their own smartphones, and Pocket Code allows to give Phiro an animated face via the phone's screen, let it talk or play arbitrary sounds, turn to human faces, and in the future also understand spoken language, besides giving Phiro a few additional very useful sensors such as loudness detection (sensitive, e.g., to clapping or loud cheering) inclination sensors (i.e., allowing Phiro to know whether it moves up or down a slope) and a compass. And since kids already own their private smartphones, there would be no need for PCs in the classroom, so any room of the school could be used! ~I was really happy to see the flexibility and support for a broad of programming methods.   I feel like there are a tremendous range of educational possibilities here.~Thank you very much for your confirmation, this is going to be fun ;)~What would be the maximum weight (Lego) the Phiro can take and still keep moving? ~Thanks, PM sent!~Thanks for the reply.#1) great added value#2) yeah, my own. Intended for my children (primary school) to improve their programming skills I'd hate to back out for the manual/lessons not being available in their native language. I guess our language will not be eligible for being amongst the first to be adopted will LOL :)#3) okay, being an EU backer I have to factor in VAT, customs fee and handling then, or will you be sending them to a EU hub?~Congratulations on the launch of the PHIRO project, looks like a great educational and fun product!~",0.0,"$50,000","PHIRO: A Smart Robot For Kids - Learn To Code In 5 Ways by Robotix USA, LLC — Kickstarter"
73,"    Facebook  |  Twitter  |  Instagram  |  LinkedIn  |  Press  |  MeetPhoton   Meet the first robot in the world that develops together with children. With Photon they can:Children love to learn by experimenting. Acquiring logical thinking ability is the key to success in their future life. Playing with most of educational toys feels like a chore and gets boring quickly. And that’s why we decided to build Photon.STORYTELLING DRIVEN LEARNING ► Photon’s story motivates children to gain knowledge while keeping them engaged in a fun tale similar to popular comic books and cartoons.

DAILY CHALLENGES
►
The robot gives kids programming related challenges. After coding simple programs, Photon can perform hundreds of tasks and show living proof of how lines of code affect reality.

FREEDOM OF CUSTOMIZATION
►
Finishing challenges awards experience points known from RPG games. Children can use them to unlock new senses for the robot or boost his parameters according to their taste. No two robots will be the same!

PAIRED MOBILE APP ► Photon is integrated with an intuitive child-friendly application for smartphones and tablets that lets kids interact with their robot and create their own programs.

EASILY DIGESTIBLE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
► The language used by Photon is based on colorful blocks and inspired by Scratch and Google Blockly. Even a 6 year old can master it in no time.The robot develops along his owner by gaining new abilities, senses and functionalities with each programming related task completed. Completing a quest to create a simple program may let the kid pick some sort of upgrade for Photon, like the ability to see or detect obstacles. This way, progress is visible right away and works as wonderful motivational tool.It's not just another toy, it's a true friend and companion.       ►  Coding - has become the most sought after skill of the 21st century. 
► Over the next ten years, programming will be one of the fastest growing occupations. ►  There will be 1.4 million programming jobs… 
►  …and only 400 thousand graduates in computer science. ►A computer science major can earn 40% more than the average college graduate . Unfortunately, few adults can program and even fewer can teach the skill. ►  Children highly benefit from learning about technology and understanding how it works. High technological literacy will become crucial for future generations. Prominent people like Bill Gates or Barack Obama and corporations like Facebook are trying to inspire children and ignite their passion for coding.Our team wants to join these efforts and support the idea that every child should be a digital creator. We believe letting the younger generation learn about new technologies will allow them to succeed in their adult lives, professional careers and let them fulfill their dreams.  
The user communicates with Photon through the “Photon-Human Translator”® (a smartphone application). The robot  presents a unique story with gradually harder challenges. All stories have been developed with the involvement of educators, psychologists, and game specialists. Thanks to 10 programmable sensors you can send Photon on specific missions like going through a maze while detecting obstacles or following a child's hand as Photon passes safely through a hazardous lava filled cave!Step by step  children encounter further challenges which teach them how modern technology works. They study the basics of programming as well as exercise their ability to think logically.The application creates additional challenges designed in a manner that allows children  to play together with their parents Children are able to proudly show off their problem solving skills to their moms and dads while parents get  the opportunity to spend time with their children and support them. We want to help in building this relationship.Finishing different tasks earns you points and allows progressing to the next level in Photon. Points may be used to further upgrade the robot, like unlocking new sensor functions, new ways to interact, and to personalize it according to your child’s preferences. No two robots will have the same set of features! That’s a first! After numerous trials and research with children, we know that it is an incredibly effective motivator.Photon is equipped with a number of sensors which allow it to “feel” and interact with the surrounding world.    Teaching programming takes place in steps of increasing difficulty. The application guides your child through the basics of programming and explains in detail how all the blocks that constitute programs work.Children may program the robot using a tablet or a smartphone, through an intuitive visual block language, inspired by well-known and proven languages for children – Scratch from MIT and Blockly from Google. We’ve simplified the language to create a programing engine suitable for children (e.g. complicated settings or excessive/negative numbers have been removed). Additionally it has been adjusted to the capabilities of the robot and the mobile devices it works on.
The only limit will be your child’s imagination.  In the beginning Photon can’t do anything and is just your everyday plastic toy. That doesn’t last long though. Kids connect with him through the app, get acquainted and receive their first coding related missions. Each task completed gives them experience points which can be spent on robot’s development. They can for example:► Make Photon’s wheels faster, which lets him perform better at many endeavors ► Unlock his vision module allowing him to notice them, as well as get better at avoiding obstacles ► Make his eyes glow in a completely new color► Teach him to react to sounds and many moreEach new function and sense unlocked motivates them to experiment and gives a bigger set of tools usable in programming. Just like a growing child, the robot gets smarter, stronger and keeps developing. RPG-like freedom of choice lets kids personalize their robots to their own  tastes. Children are proud when their progress and successes in studying can be shown off and appreciated.  It is difficult to keep children stay focused and motivated. That’s why we worked together with experts in the fields of psychology and gamification to make playing with our robot as fun as possible. We’ve created an interactive story where the child and the robot are the main characters and have to work together. This builds a sense of responsibility which is a huge motivator and fosters learning. Photon’s story encourages kids to take action and gain knowledge while having fun. When the robot was traveling to Earth, he had an accident and collided with an asteroid. His spacecraft broke into pieces that scattered all over the world. Now Photon wants to find these pieces, but he needs help from children! During their journey together they will meet many interesting characters that have found some of the spacecraft’s parts. These characters will present further challenges for Photon and the kids. Only if they pass a specific challenge, they will be allowed to pick up the missing piece.All heroes of the story feel distinct and likeable. Their personalities are based on real human emotions like sadness, joy, anger, fear or curiosity. We’ve consulted the designs with a bunch of friendly kindergarteners and primary schools who had to approve every single one.   Photon has been created for children who are in elementary school. The system has been designed together with kids in order to perfectly fit their expectations, abilities and needs. After  countless months of work and numerous prototypes, we’re happy to announce that children love playing with the final version of Photon.
We’re committed to assuring parents that they are giving their children a high quality and a well-designed tool that can help develop creativity, social skills and ignite interest in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Children were a huge source of inspiration when it comes to design and ergonomics of our creation. Yes, they pointed us in the right direction and described  what their dream robot should look like. The entire interface design process unfolded with a constant participation of parents, children, teachers, and psychologists. We have made every effort to make Photon safe, attractive as well as user-friendly. You can even add new accessories to change his appearance. A top hat? Maybe a stylish dress? The choice is yours! :)  Kids are creative by nature, and their ideas can be extremely surprising. That’s  why we’ve created our robot with safety as a top priority. The robot is made out of durable and child-friendly materials. The internal electronics have been secured  in a way that makes children unable to  access them by any means. Worrying about your favorite Bella, Duke, Sparky or other furry family member having a hard time, getting scared or too jealous of Photon? We have tested our robot with the help of dogs and cats and they seem to love it as much as kids. While learning to code with it might be a bit out of their reach, they still have heaps of fun.  One of the most interesting things we’ve  noticed  during the testing phase is the fact that children aid and motivate each other while working with Photon. Cooperation and team-play are crucial for them and make the entire learning process much more engaging.The robot teaches young people that they have to work together to overcome  challenges. When one child has problems with a particular level, the other attempts to explain what he or she is doing wrong and how to do it better.  Cooperating like this  positively affects children, their development and social skills.   Children are adorably social creatures. With their robots being unique and personalized they love to show them off. When testing  Photon at a friendly kindergarten we’ve noticed that they quickly came up with some funny competitions like races, obstacle courses and our favorite… sumo wrestling. That ensured us that creating a good multiplayer mode that could encourage positive rivalry is a must in Photon’s case. Robots can communicate with each other, play games or fight, and use special moves. For example you can “cast a spell” and gain an advantage in a racing game - just like in the legendary Mario Kart (R) games! We plan to add leaderboards and daily challenges so that our beloved ones can compete with other children from around the world.  Our aim is to make  the entire Photon experience enjoyable – from opening the box to setting it up and usage. The box itself looks like a spaceship and sets the stage for Photon’s journey. We want the magic of working with Photon to begin as soon as  its little owner sees the mysterious package. Everything made for kids should be as intuitive as possible. The smartphone app is based on visual hints to help the children that still lack a solid grasp on the alphabet get the most of it. . The coloring, shapes and patterns were also based on the research and analysis of  our youngest specialists. Our dream is to bring Photon to every child's house! To fulfill that dream we need your help. We appreciate all your support and hope we can do a lot of good for the world!           We have prepared a game full of challenges to let you taste the positive energy of Photon! Every few days we will unlock a series of challenges, and only after they are completed, you will you be able to access the new ones. After completing a certain number of achievements, we’ll  unlock new possibilities and upgrades for the robot and the campaign itself. We want to develop the campaign in the same way children will develop our robots! :)            Let’s see what we can achieve together:   
To honor our wonderful supporters, each Photon you receive will get a stylish Kickstarter markings on it. Additionally, the unlocked achievement bonuses will be available exclusively to the people who have backed the project. The jetpack module is also a Kickstarter exclusive.  Photon was conceived in the minds of Martin Joka, Mike Grzes, Chris Dziemianczuk, Michael Bogucki and Mac Kopczynski, four students and one academic teacher from the Bialystok University of Technology, Poland. Now we're an international team consisting of engineers, programmers and developers  from the USA (Chicago), Poland (Bialystok) and Belgium (Bruxelles).Photon's creators have received numerous distinctions and honorable mentions for their work. They have won prestigious technological contests organized by companies such as Microsoft or Phillips and have been awarded by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education – they are prize-winners of the “Generation of the Future” program. The team members are graduates of many prestigious programs, e.g. TOP500 Innovators. They are also mentioned in many well known rankings, e.g. New Europe 100 ranking - the list of 100 most dynamically developing innovators in Europe, which is created by laRespublica and Google. Their personal experience is worth noting - in 2014 one of the creators of Photon, Mike Grzes, worked as the coordinator and the main constructor of Hyperion 2, an award-winning Mars rover. This year the CEO of Photon, Martin Joka, has become a nominee for MIT Innovators under 35.         Promise is a promise. This phrase – incredibly important when you’re creating something for kids - is one of our main mottos when building Photon. That’s why we have decided to provide honest delivery dates, and avoid making children wait pointlessly.
Photon will arrive on Earth after December 2016. There is a chance we can make it for Christmas, provided there are lots of preorders and we get our hands on production molds earlier. On our way to Kickstarter we have met lots wonderful people, companies and organizations that never hesitated to help us. Photon is able to become reality thanks to their help!Thank you!We have spent many days and sleepless nights creating this project and it’s finally time to show it off to the children of the world. We’re doing everything to assure a quality as high as possible. The final step to make Photon real belongs to Kickstarter and most importantly: you! Together we can make it easily. If you believe that Photon can change the future of children and improve their education help us to reach our goal!

74," Do you have a complex robot or automated project that you just aren't getting done? Looking for a motor driver that's simple to set up and easy to use?We've developed the SlushEngine which is a smart stepper motor driver that works with the Raspberry Pi and many other devices (ie. Beaglebone and Arduino). By connecting the Raspberry Pi to a network of motor drivers, we can control the motors in realtime without overloading the Raspberry Pi.////

The Kickstarter has been going great but we've been getting a lot of request for something at a lower cost but still has 4 motor drivers.So, by popular demand! The SlushEngine: Lite is a new pledge and a lighter version of the Model X. It's meant for smaller stepper motors and lower current levels. It is designed to handle most DIY 3D printer systems and small scale stepper CNC machines. SlushEngine: Lite technical specificationsSlushEngine: Model XProgramming the SlushEngineThe original idea of the SlushEngine was to keep it simple. We wanted it to be as easy as possible to program the board. One of the simplest and most powerful programming languages is Python. It's difficult or impossible to have Python run on standard microcontrollers, so we used the Raspberry Pi to execute the Python code and communicate with the smart motor drivers on the SlushEngine. We can now program the SlushEngine in 3 simple lines of code. The above sample is the simplest implementation of the SlushEngine driver. It sets up a motor with a default configuration, then moves backwards 400 steps. When it moves the motor, it also incorporates an acceleration and deceleration curve, to ensure smooth operations.SlushEngine: Model X technical specificationsDemonstration of the SlushEngine's Motor Control  Demonstration on Roboteurs Delta RobotSlushEngine: Model X

Mini (@ Pledge $80)The SlushEngine: Model X Mini is a basic version that is just meant to get one motor spinning. It works under the same libraries as the Model X, and can be a handy little board for different projects. SlushEngine Open SourceWe want the SlushEngine to be a continuous project, and to do this we need strong feedback from the community. The best way to get this is to make the entire project Open Source. Once the Kickstarter has been completed, all hardware design and software files will be released as a Git repository to the public. So if you want to implement the SlushEngine software or hardware in your own project you can. Backers will get early access to this repository. This repository will include: Roboteurs is an Ontario based company focused on the needs of education based robotics for students at all levels of learning. Currently the company has in its pipeline products for high school level students, as well as advanced robotics for University and College level students.

No comments here yet? sad.Quick question: the motor drivers can handle 30something V but the industrial outputs will only supply 24V. Is there a voltage regulator inbetween? Or do I have to supply the voltage to the output ports seperatly?Also don't you need to cool your stepper motor drivers?And did you test your board under full load conditions? Then you would pull 4x7+4x3=40A through your board. quite a challenge :).The other 8 general IO pins are just rooted directly from the raspberry or do you have some input protection for them? And as last question: what is the industrial input and output you are talking about ? there are quite a few out there ;) thanks~,0.0,"CA$ 7,500",SlushEngine Stepper Motor Driver - by Roboteurs by Justin Policarpio and Reiner Schmidt — Kickstarter
75," The dictionary defines ""Tyro"" as ""a beginner or novice."" TyroBot aims to get people started building and programming robots! TyroBot is a kit. 3D print the parts, snap in the servos, screw in the controller, and you are up and running in under 3 hours. Don't have a 3D printer? Just back the ""complete kit"" option and we'll 3D print the parts for you in bright orange. All it takes is a screwdriver to make a pile of parts become a fully functioning humanoid robot.  Once TyroBot is built, flip the switch and TyroBot is operational. Using the built in software, you can make TyroBot walk forward, backward, left and right without ever having to plug him into a computer. When you are ready for something more advanced, connect TyroBot to a computer and follow easy programming tutorials to make him do more advanced maneuvers.  Never programmed before? TyroBot's libraries make programming easy. Walk forward, look around, and send an email in just 4 lines of code.TyroBot's firmware comes complete with a menu system so you have complete control of your robot at all times. Select ""run program"" in the menu to run your arduino code, Select ""settings,"" to view WiFi connections, or select the arrows to create a walk routine right on the robot. The entire robot runs on Tyro Board, a custom robotics controller based around the ATSAMD21 32 bit microcontroller. What this means is that the programs seen in the videos and images only use up 20% of TyroBot's memory. Along with the microcontroller, TyroBot has an ESP8266 WiFi module for wireless communication, a triple axis accelerometer, USB charging circuit, and a 2.8in TFT touchscreen display. The board also hosts two expansion ports for further customization.  To keep it simple, we offer two versions of TyroBot.The complete kit includes absolutely everything you need to build a TyroBot except a screwdriver, microUSB cable and a computer.TyroBot has been under development for the past year and a half, and has progressed beautifully. After countless 3D prints, over 4 board redesigns, and much testing, TyroBot is finally production ready. All the images you see on this page are of the actual TyroBot you will receive if you back this project. TyroBot is ready to be produced. With the launch of this Kickstarter, we have already published the design files and software libraries. All that is left to do is create high quality video and written tutorials. TyroBot is ready to see the world, and with your help, that can be possible.Hello! I am Tyler Spadgenske, the creator of TyroBot and founder of Tyro Electronics.

76," We want to build a STEM kit that gets kids excited about technology. So we have created the LittleArm, a simple, trainable, programmable, Arduino robot arm.In 2016, a guy in a garage built a small robot arm using an Arduino Uno and his 3D printer. After tons of people asked him to turn it into a kit, Slant Concepts put it on Kickstarter. It was funded in under a week and hit more than 260% of it goal by the end.After sending out those first arms, the feedback started coming in. We are smart enough to listen to the people who are using our stuff. So we took every comment and common problem and eliminated them with extreme prejudice. When we were done we had created a great machine. This is the LittleArm 2C. The desktop Arduino robot arm we created for kids to learn about robotics and technology. The LittleArm 2C is designed to be the kit that kids can easily use so that STEM classes can implement more robotics curriculum. We are on Kickstarter now to fund the first run of these new arms and develop improved curriculum and content so teachers can easily utilize the LittleArm as a tool in classrooms, to get kids excited about tech.Press Materials can be obtained here.$5000 - Vote on Colors for the LittleArmWe will hold a vote for the top 3 color schemes that will be used on the LittleArms. $10,000 - Sensor CubeWhen we hit $10,000 Multiple upgrade rewards will be unlocked that include the Sensor Cube. A module that contains 1 infrared and 2 ultrasonic proximity sensors. Control individual joints, set trigger events, and even create kinematic programs using it as a 3D controller. A great tool to introduce kids to various sensors and how they work.The 2C is actually very important. First of all, this is the second version of the LittleArm, hence the 2. The original LittleArm was launched in 2016 and the response has been amazing.The C? Well, the ""C"" encompasses a lot of things. Here they are.Clean - This are has no rough edges. We tweaked everything so that it is a perfect little machine. We even have loops to hold the wires against the arm, so they aren't flapping out in the breeze.Children - The original LittleArm was built primarily for makers and kids with adult supervision. This Littlearm is so easy to put together that a 6 year-old can do it. We know because we spent hours in classrooms with kids teaching and watching the kids play with them. The 2C is practically child-proof.Complete - This might be a stretch, but we don't know what we will tweak in the future. We consider it finished, except for electrical and software expansions.Controllable and Trainable through USB or Bluetooth AppsThe LittleArm 2C uses the same free Desktop and Android App that we developed for the original LittleArm. They allow you to move the arm and record a set of waypoints that you can play back.Kids learning about robotics for the first time will be introduced to basic functions and behaviors that all modern robots use.The full LittleArm 2C kit comes with a Bluetooth module so that it can be controlled with an android smartphone using our free android App in the appstore. Electrically, it is just plug and play. Plug in the servos to  the spot on the board labeled ""Servos,"" and plug in the Bluetooth module where is says ""Bluetooth,"" then give it some power. That is it. Reprogram with Arduino or BlocklySince the entire LittleArm is built on the Arduino Nano, it can be reprogrammed from scratch using either the Arduino IDE or graphical tools like BlocklyDuinoWe are using a custom-designed PCB originally created for the MePed robot, which makes using the Arduino even easier. It also allows expansion to new sensors like ultrasonic and IR by just plugging them in. You can also re-write the Arduino code so that you can control two LittleArms with a single board.Arduino NanoThe original LittleArm used an Uno. But we wanted the 2C to be more compact, so we used a Nano. We love the Arduino because it lets students and makers tap into the huge global community built around Adafruit. We don't want to hinder the creation and hacking of this thing. BluetoothBluetooth now comes with every LittleArm kit with an electronics package. We are very proud to make this available with the new arms.The LittleArm 2C is the second generation of the LittleArm. What have we done? A Ton.Faster 3D PrintingThe LittleArm is the among the first really viable 3D printed robot arms. But with the 2C we have improved on that. We have shaved about 1 hour off the original estimated 8 hour print time. Anyone that gets the files will get the arm that much faster.Integrated Wire Organizing loopsNo longer will you have loops of wiring hanging around and getting jerked out.Toughest Arm Ever
 When we made the original LittleArm we designed it for makers. People that would appreciate the machine that they are building. But with the many schools that are building them, we knew we had to child-proof it some more. 

 We have reinforced every joint so that kids can ""work"" with the LittleArm 2C with little risk of breaking it. There is no other arm as resilient as the 2C. Only 31 Parts (counting screws)The LittleArm has the fewest number of parts of any other robot arm kit. to put it together it is basically just snap-and-go the screws just make sure it doesn't fly apart. Operates in all OrientationsNo other desktop robot arm can work in any orientation. Mount it where ever you want. (Note: Performance does decrease in other orientations)The CoverSome folks don't want to constantly rewire the LittleArm. It is also a problem again with kids who have tendency to jerk wires out. So along with eliminating the original breadboard we have given the Assembled version of the Arm a cover to make it look a little cleaner and protect it a little.Absolute MinimalismThere are a few makers that don't want the LittleArm to just be stand-alone and for the Arduino. So this time we have created the LittleArm 2C Brainless. The Brainless is literally just the arm. Makers can mount it to projects and use their own controller, at a minimal cost.To create a kit that is expected to be used in a STEM classroom you have to have great support. We built much of this with the original LittleArm. But we have gone even further with the 2C to make it is great STEM kit. Build in under 20 minutes

 The LittleArm  2C has 31 parts, including the 15 screws.  You just need fingers and one common screwdriver to put it together. Most of the servos snap into place without screws. The only thing you have to do is put the screws in the horns. This makes it great for classrooms where teachers are spread thin, so kids can operate independently.  The WebsiteThe LittleArm Website has become a hub for everything LittleArm. Spare parts are available to purchase and we have a deep and continuous stream of resources and tutorials coming out. If someone has a problem working with their LittleArm they can find a solution on the Website.WaldoOne of the coolest extensions that we created as a tutorial for the LittleArm was the Waldo. A Waldo is motion capture device which lets you control the LittleArm. Whatever you do with the Waldo the LittleArm does.We designed the Waldo as a neat project for makers. We are now making it available as an assembled piece of hardware.  SensorsWe have been proud of how the training allowed the LittleArm to be similar to industrial robot arms. But it has never had much sensing. So we have added an ultrasonic sensor that can be used as a trigger for the arm. Use it to sense when people come near or when a coffee mug is placed near the robot.Littlearm BrainlessThis kit is really for the hardcore makers out there that want to actually add the LittleArm to an existing project. We designed a minimalist base and got rid of the electronics. Stick it together and add it to whatever project you want, or plug in your own microcontrollers.LittleArm Full KitIn the Full kit you have everything you need to get started with the LittleArm and get it up and moving within 15-30 minutes.LittleArm AssembledSurprise, it is exactly the same as the LittleArm Full Kit, but we have put is all together for you. You just have to plug in the power supply and download the app to start using.LittleArm Pro Set - $75Fully Assembled LittleArm with ultrasonic sensor and extra gripper set. the gripper set includes, a hook, wrist, and pen clamp. LittleArm Olympic - $92Full LittleArm kit with ultrasonic Sensor, extra gripper set, battery pack, and assembled waldo motion capture rig.

77," RoboCORE is a cloud-powered device and development
platform that is the heart of your new DIY robots for professional or hobby
use.You can now build
personal robots from scratch without high-level programming skills and
at an affordable price. RoboCORE gives you the hardware and software to build
almost any robot you can imagine. What's more, it’s not dependent on any
particular mechanics system, so you can use simple metal constructions,
as well as LEGO® bricks. You can also connect your smartphone or USB camera to
RoboCORE in order to unlock some cool telepresence features. RoboCORE is not
just a driver, it’s a whole ecosystem. It allows you to create advanced
constructions for anyone. Stretch your brain cells, develop the passion and
discover the new opportunities. You’ve got your own personal computer, now it’s
time for your personal robot. Share our passion for robotics!We believe
that contemporary consumer robotics are at the same stage as the computer
industry was in the late 1970s, when computers were mainly used for industry
and military applications. Only a few people believed back then that computers
could be used in every home. They dreamed about a world in which it was hard to
imagine people’s lives without PCs. During that time, many geeks were building
prototypes (like the Apple 1) in their garages. We can compare them to the
contemporary amateur-constructed robots.We are
robotics enthusiasts and, like our predecessors, we also have a dream. We
believe that thanks to RoboCORE, modern and expensive robots that are now
produced for business, industrial and military applications will finally be
available to everyone. Our mission is to enable a wide audience of supporters
for building robots in an easy and inexpensive way. You will be able to use
off-the-shelf components. For many potential businesses, the entry barriers
will disappear, and new companies will arise to create inexpensive robots ready
to solve real human problems. That is why we are here at Kickstarter.com. Together,
as a community, we could change the world, so we would like to ask you for your
support. But first things first! Let us share some more details about the
project with you.RoboCORE
greatly simplifies the creation of robots for the consumer market, allowing for
both professional and hobby use. For example creating a simple telepresence
robot takes less than an hour, and it’s extremely inexpensive. You can build
one for $300 in 45 minutes (mechanics take about 75% of that), having a lot of
fun at the same time, and then access it from anywhere in the world through our
cloud.Let's see how to make a telepresence robot with RoboCORE in just 10 minutes:To build a
robot you need an idea, hardware, software and mechanics. RoboCORE gives you
both hardware and software, thus you’ve got only half the work to do.Our hardware
was designed toYou can plug
almost any external device or module into your RoboCORE, because it integrates
motor ports, sensor ports and universal expansion headers  with many popular communication interfaces. It’s compatible with LEGO® MINDSTORMS® NXT and EV3
controllers. Once RoboCORE is attached to the mechanics you can manage your
robot via intuitive software, including Web, Android and iPhone apps. Connect
your new electronic fellow to the Internet and control it from virtually anywhere
in the world. You don’t need to install anything on your computer or notebook
to control or even program your robot – no more wires between your
constructions and your computer. You can write code or update the firmware for
your robot lying on the beach with your smartphone or tablet in one hand and a
tasty drink in the other.RoboCORE programming is very simple. Our
goal was to find the perfect balance and create powerful software for both
professionals and beginners. That is why we
created our robotics framework (hFramework). It will be available in open-source
model after a successful Kickstarter campaign.If you have ever programmed the
Arduino, you can easily handle the RoboCORE too. hFramework is based on a
real-time operating system, so in an easy and transparent way you can create multi-threaded,
real-time algorithms defining your robot's behavior, with strict control over
the execution time of each operation. hFramework is written in C/C++. Here is complete code (yes, in
only one file) to make the simplest telepresence robot in the worldDon’t like C++? No problem. hFramework
is the really powerful core that can be used as a base to support different
programming languages. Thanks to Micro Python project (one of the successfully funded Kickstarter projects) RoboCORE can be programmed in Python language!We plan to create another alternative
programming interfaces for Arduino and Scratch so that even the youngest will
be able to create the greatest robots!The last cool
thing is our cloud application: the RoboCORE Platform. Thanks to that, you canThe RoboCORE driver connects to the Internet platform in three waysYou do not need to connect any programming device or
install anything on your computer to program the robot. You can do
everything from your favorite Web browser.If you're still
reading, we're almost sure that RoboCORE is the product for you. It doesn’t
matter if you are a professional engineer, a robotics enthusiast or a computer
geek. With a little bit of knowledge and a pinch of passion, you can build your
own robots easily without spending a lot of money.It’s inexpensive!You can build
robots without wasting huge amounts of cash. During the Kickstarter campaign,
RoboCORE costs only 89$. If this is still
too much for you or you prefer to take an easier step into basic robotics, try
RoboCORE-mini devices that you can get by backing us with just 59$. This special offer is available for
backers only. After the campaign, the products will cost 119$ (RoboCORE) and 85$ (RoboCORE-mini). We believe that thanks to you we will be
able to go global! It doesn’t matter if you are from the US, Europe, South
America or Africa. Everyone should have a chance to begin their adventure with
the easiest robotics ever!Building really IS easy!You don’t need
to know different programming languages to write your first application. Just
download the basic algorithm templates from our website and begin to learn how
to code directly from them. In the future we plan to add programming courses to
the RoboCORE Platform. Thanks to the Web IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) integrated into our cloud, you can write code, compile it and
upload ready firmware directly from a Web browser. It is extremely convenient,
because you don’t need to install anything on your PC or notebook. The software
defines not only the behavior of the robot, but also its user interface in the Web
browser (you can see it when you use a robot). You can also send the different
commands to your robot using keyboard shortcuts or buttons implemented in the
user interface.You can build anything you want!Our robotics
controller can be used to build various constructions. Your imagination is the
only limit. You can create robots that will do programmed tasks autonomously –
without human intervention. For example you can ask your robot to “go to the
kitchen when the lights turn off”. There are many different scenarios for using
RoboCORE – building telepresence robots, driving, swimming or manufacturing
devices.Here are some examples of robots that we made with RoboCORE in just a
couple of daysEasily manage your robot remotely!
Our cloud is
your command center. It allows you to manage all your robots. Imagine a social
network with both humans and robots, like Facebook for robotics enthusiasts. The
RoboCORE Platform contains two lists – one with real people and another with
your electronic creations. How does it work?Firstly, log
into your account @ the RoboCORE Platform. Then, if you want to connect your
robot to the cloud, simply write the unique code that is associated with each

project of the future. Once upon a time, one of us said that our main idea
reminded him of the heart or brain of the robot. We decided to follow this
thought. Finally, after hours and lots of drafts, we delivered the heart-shaped
box you see below. RoboCORE-mini is smaller rectangle-shaped unit measuring
82 × 82 mm instead of 115 × 125 mm (its bigger
brother's measurements).RoboCORE has
not always looked like it does today. During the last 18 months, we’ve created
many versions. Since the first prototype was developed, we’ve learned many new
things and improved even more. The current model is the result of thousands of
hours of hard work leading to a design we can be proud of. After testing and
fixing all the bugs, we were ready to present version 1.0. Soon, we will
present you milestones of RoboCORE evolution on our blog.We are young
but experienced enthusiasts of robotics and science, and graduates of the
biggest and the most respected universities in Poland, including the AGH University
of Science and Technology in Kraków. We were involved in many innovative
projects in the fields of electrical engineering, automatics, computer science
and telecommunications. We won many awards in different local and international
robotics, electronics and programming competitions. With significant experience gathered during our work for
large companies operating in the tech industry, we decided to establish our own
brand and make our dream come true. Our mission is to enable robotics for a
wide audience. We believe that we can change the world, and that’s what we
aspire to!Dominik Nowak – co-founder and CEO at Husarion Inc.; Embedded

company – she translates the language of engineers to the language of ""normal""
people. Joanna is not very familiar with robotics, but in this case it’s a big
advantage. Her experience and combative personality complement our team's
qualifications.We believe
that robotics are at the same stage as the computer industry was in the late 1970s.
Only a few people now remember the times when people such as Steve Jobs and
Bill Gates were just garage geeks. The same thing is happening to us now. . .
except that Jobs and Gates couldn’t use Kickstarter! The further development of
consumer robotics is in your hands. Together we could change the history of
modern technology. It is not easy, but we have learned from the past that anything
is possible. You need only to have enough faith and build a strong community
that will help you to move on with your project. RoboCORE is our beginning.
Thanks to you, we will be able to start the first part of further
mass-production and develop our R&D department. You have your own personal

Next step is the Mission Pilot, with the goal of collecting 5kg of debris from Toronto Island.This will enable us to reach the point where the effort could be replicated in different locations, along with the release of the 3d printable robot platform with the first set of interchangeable modules.We need your support by backing this project. This will help the Mission Pilot become a reality by funding the Field Tests leading up to the Mission Pilot, and costs associated with the further development.""Ottawa woman creates Bowie the beach-cleaning robot; 4-wheeled robot inspired by Mars rover, named after late singer"" - Chloé Fedio and Giacomo Panico, CBC Ottawa""This project is a great example of young makers and engineers working to promote environmental stewardship through engineering and robotics."" - Tom Spendlove, Engineering.com""It seems that when someone with an engineering or DIY mindset collaborates with someone with different experiences - musical talent, for example - really neat things get made."" - Jeremy Cook, RoboticsTrends.com""Kennedy is using her passion for robotics to improve the environment"" - Laurie Monsebraaten, Toronto Star""Robot is on a mission to clean up Great Lakes shorelines"" - Morgan Linn, Great Lakes Echo""Robot Missions is on a mission to improve the environment, one bot at a time"" - Laura Mordas-Schenkein, Inhabitat.comWe are destroying our natural spaces with pollution. Our shorelines are littered with debris that wash ashore.Plastics break down into tinier fragments, and pose a threat to the local environment:Above is a local example of debris along Toronto Island, where the Mission Pilot will take place.This pertains to GOAL 15: Life on Land of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.The Mission Pilot will lay the groundwork for creating a procedure for replicating the usage of the robot to clean shoreline debris. This will be key for a full-scale implementation, and extending the efforts to different locations and community groups.We will venture to the location (Toronto Island - Manitou Beach), and deploy the robot to begin cleaning. The Field Test crew will assist with this, along with collecting observations about the environment. A debrief session will follow, tying the experience to the larger theme of technology and nature, and how we can effect a larger change.The goal of the Mission Pilot is to collect 5kg of plastic debris. Through multiple passes, of the robot the debris will be deposited to the 'home base' location. The debris will then be hand sorted to determine what will be recycled, and possibly saved for creating 3d printer filament from it.The over-arching purpose of Robot Missions is to enable makers and humanitarians to collaborate on improving the environment through community driven missions. The first mission is clearing debris from shorelines. Our vision for clearing shoreline debris is for there to be a fleet of robots that autonomously navigate the shorelines, forming patterns within the waypoints, and collect the debris for further recycling.I'm Erin (@RobotGrrl), the founder of Robot Missions.Robot Missions began as a project out of Studio Y at the MaRS Discovery District, Canada's leading innovation hub, in Toronto, ON. Bringing my technology background to the program, I learned about tying it to a social impact.Previous to this, I participated in Fab Academy. My final project was a prototype of an unfolding CubeSat robot controlled by a headband. I launched my first robot kit, RoboBrrd on Indiegogo. Designed, manufactured, and shipped the product to over 100 backers.I started the Robot Party, an online Google+ Hangout that reached over 1 million followers. Named an Intel Emerging Young Entrepreneur, and brought home the gold medal for Canada in the robot olympics, RoboGames. My work has been featured in Forbes, WIRED, IEEE Spectrum and on the Discovery Channel.To date, we have constructed a prototype of the robot. It has been adapted to each field test. Here are it's high level capabilities:In development is the next version of the robot platform for the Mission Pilot. Our aim is to implement new features based on the need for them arising during the Field Tests. Our future plan is to release it as open source hardware, for other Fab Labs to replicate.With a group of volunteers forming the Field Test crew, we are able to learn about the environment, and test how the robot performs in different settings.The crew is given a Concept of Operations Guidebook, which details the tasks the robot will be doing, and how they can assist in the subteams available.During our first Field Test on a blustery afternoon at Cherry Beach, the robot worked successfully, and we learned more about its capabilities in the environment. It even started to snow!Our next Field Test was at Sunnyside Beach, where we learned how the robot can navigate multiple types of different terrain. Check out the pics here.Field Tests are usually every two weeks, you can find out about the next one on Facebook.We gave a workshop at University of Toronto, organised by Get Your Bot On.Given a scenario, groups had to determine what task within the problem to solve, who the robot would help, what it would do, and what it's impact would be.Over the course of the summer, we will be engaging with the online community through the Robot Party.

80," Our dream is to bring the industrial robot arm to daily life, let everyone can enjoy the joy of it and simplify the life from doing repetitive tasks. So we tried to creat a high repeat precision (up to 0.2mm), stepper motor, Arduino-based, easy to control, low-cost desktop robotic arm. It calls Dobot.Imagine when your new born baby says ""flower"" the first time in his/her life, and it gets sent to a Arduino robotic arm, automatically the word transforms to the character 龙 (dragon, see the gif below) in Chinese calligraphy on a piece of paper or a 3D printed plastic flower, or be typed on a mobile phone that sends to your parents. Dobot robotic arm can also help you write some sweet words for your lovers, no matter what language.As makers, we love tools. Dobot robot arm will play a big role being a good tool, you can grave a film figure by yourself with the help of Dobot arm, sounds cool, isn't it? DIY the Kung Fu Panda, Baymax, Mario or other figure you like now !3D printing pen with DobotReal time 3D printing!With the high repeatability of Dobot, we can mount a 3D printer head on our robotic arm and turn our Dobot arm into a 3D printer!  Check the Update #12 for more.MoreoverEven the Co-founder of Arduino wants to buy one! The Dobot team was extremely flattered when running into the Massimo Banzi at the 2015 Shenzhen Maker Faire and hearing he say he liked it and wanted to buy one! ""I'm lucky to get the chance to see lots of hardware projects, but Dobot's blend of high production value, precision and openness has me really excited!""   —— Jeremy Gordon, Former Vice President @TwitterDobot is versatile and designed for everyone. It can draw, write, text, move, grab things following your orders. It liberates your arms from doing repetitive tasks. For more advanced makers, Dobot has great potential to be an essential part of your own project.PCB Soldering with Dobot robotic armWith high accuracy precision, Dobot arm even can help you to grab some little nail!Can Dobot use a mobile phone to turn off the lights? Can Dobot fetch an apple in a folder by brain (EEG) control? Of course! We are firm believers in furthering the possibilities of Dobot robotic arm! Now it’s your turn to make your magic of Dobot happen. You can do what you want with Dobot Robot Arm. Dobot Brings Industrial Precision and Power to Your LifeDobot’s high precision is the highlight. We spent much of our energy to optimize its technology. With such a low cost, we have managed to maintain the industrial precision level. When performing repetitive actions, the error in precision is as small as 0.2mm, empowering you to do delicate work without losing the precision. See below for more detailed info on specs. 
Dobot is super easy to controlEasy usability comes first during the design of Dobot. We have given a lot of thought on users without technical backgrounds, and how to help them better control robotic arms. In order to make as young as 5-years-old kids able to use Dobot in ease, we have done extensive research and designed 7 controlling methods, including PC, mobile APP, EEG, voice, vision, leap motion and gestures, whichever suits your purpose the best.Stepper motor: Dobot works quietlyWe have also considered on where the users will be using it, and tired our best to make the noise level as low as possible. By using customized stepper motor, we are able to minimize noise level, making Dobot much quieter than low-cost servo robotic arms and more household-friendly.Here’s a comparison video with servo based robotic arms.Dobot is open sourceDobot supports three OpenSource Firmware for special applications and developers with different programming preferences. 1. Complete developed by Dobot team
Easy for developers familiar with Industrial robots. 2. Base on grbl (https://github.com/grbl/grbl)
Easy for developers familiar with open source CNC machine.3. Base on Marlin (https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin)
 Easy for developers familiar with RepRap compatiable 3D printer. Also we provide communication interface for OpenCV (http://opencv.org/) to add vision to Dobot.Dobot is a maker team and we create what's best for makers. We use Arduino as the controller. Although when tackling some critical problems, we found this might not be the perfect solution, after continuous improvements, we believe this could equip superb functionality with Dobot.  Processing is the widely-applauded data visualization and programming platform for beginners. Simply drag and click, you can program Dobot at your will on its user-friendly interface. Scratch is also a briiliant visual programming language that's more widely used by children, artists and makers. It helps them to control and program all types of electronic devices and interactive products. Dobot's control is based on the easy-for-understanding serial communication protocol whose working principles are all open-sourced. We will add more manpower in developing control extensions based on Scratch, and believe this will make operating Dobot applications easier for children, enabling them to bring their ideas to life. Arduino Library
We have included diversified written motion functions for user to make their own Dobot code community. We’ve included forward and inverse solution, point to point, line, jump Path Planning, everything is open source, and you can make it better. These code examples have very similar principles to industrial robot developing and they are very useful for one who wants to understand how an industrial robot works. 
In our code, we provide the limit and working range protection, various joint and coordinate commands, combine these functions and you are the magician.
Electronic Parts

 Our initial thought was to design a shield for the Arduino (Mega2560) for connecting mega2560 and 3 stepper driver boards and also to contain a current amplifying module to drive the vacuum pump and the solenoid valve. Meanwhile, it can manage driving 2 servos with 3 steppers. Based on that, we modified the design to accommodate more users, thus another shield of Arduino was born to satisfy all of the above functions. This eliminates the constitute of stepper driver boards and reconsiders the measures for overcurrent protection and heat dissipation. Our core competency is to employ fewer wires with a better outlook ensured.RewardsMechanical PartsHow Dobot is made and how we made its incredible precision level possible. The mechanical structure entirely employed CNC cutting technology. For key parts the machinery accuracy has reached 0.02mm. Joint connections adopted high accuracy axes coupled with chrome alloy interference lit, ensuring structural stability and accuracy. On the motor side, Dobot designed the high accuracy speed reducer motor, providing consistent motor power for the robot arm. On the material side, Dobot was made of high strength aluminium alloy and processed by anodic oxidation treatment,  to ensure the sleekness and strength of the surface.Here's some details about the manufacturing, we chose the high performance CNC machine instead of laser cut to guarantee a 0.02mm precision, which provides the basis of our high quality. For software, we have done a great deal of optimization. The software supports speed look-ahead small line blocks interpolation algorithm, able to fit any type of curve and ensure processing efficiency. Moreover, with the Three Axes Linkage Method fine interpolation, you can control the trajectory of the end effector of the Dobot accurately, empowering it with complex curvilinear motions. We wanted to make sure Dobot is accessible to everyone. Through immense effort and countless negotiations with suppliers, we were able to get better deals without compromising the quality and reliability. That’s how we made the price so affordable so more users could use it. We are at our beginning stage and would like to invite you to help promote Dobot so more people passionate about making could know about us. We will offer discounts and refunds to show our appreciation for your support. To do so, after you purchase Dobot, simply fill out the Dobot Promotion Code (which will be included in the package) and Paypal account information, and we will return 20~100 U.S. Dollars to your account.

You have broken your promise. The Arduino part in that project means absolutely nothing without the protocol Arduino talks to the FPGA. It could as well be not Arduino at all - nothing changes - we still can't use it and have to replace hardware with something that works and not proprietary.~Fix your broken Dobot software for 25 US Dollar: Purchase a RAMPS 1.4 shield (10$) and 5 A4988 drivers (15 USD), enable microstepping (add 3 jumpers under each driver) and use this Arduino script. It works perfectly fine. Without the jumpers it was too noisy due to full step. See https://gist.github.com/erwincoumans/7433a9ea7951932b9d79 and https://www.reddit.com/r/Dobot/comments/45ilan/controlling_dobot_with_ramps_14~The Arduino firmware software is totally unreliable and we would like to have access to the source code, as promised in the 'open source' claim of Kickstarter. Right now, the Dobot arm is totally useless, unless you purchase a RAMPS 1.4 shield and remove the custom FPGA. Then it is more noisy. Do we really have to reverse engineer your SPI protocol to the FPGA? Please reconsider open sourcing the Arduino firmware as promised.~@creators  You have said the project will open everything include the mechanical part ,the electronic part and the software .

81," Coding is an important skill for kids to learn. But unless parents and educators can make it fun, kids are never going to stick with it.We’ve created Kamibot to be a small, programmable robot that kids can endlessly customise by writing their own code, and by adding creative papercraft skins.日本メディアの報道はこちらKamibot reimagines programming education as something fun and affordable.In addition to programming Kamibot, you can also control it with your smartphone or tablet.We’ve built Kamibot around the open-source Arduino platform, so kids can easily learn how to code using Scratch, a drag-and-drop programming language. The programming skills kids learn with Kamibot are easily transferrable to real-world applications.Throughout 2015, we tested Kamibot in Korean schools. Kamibot made learning fun for kids, gaining praise from teachers, parents and even students.During his last State of the Union Address, President Obama talked about the importance of “offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one.” We share his opinion that computer science is important for kids to learn and his vision for making it accessible. That’s what’s spurred us on to keep developing Kamibot.While Kamibot is primarily aimed at children between the ages of 8 and 17, it is also finding fans among adult papercraft and robot enthusiasts.Kamibot is more than just an educational robot. You can also control Kamibot with a smartphone or tablet. This is crucial because kids get to know Kamibot as a toy and see its full range of capabilities before they start to program it themselves.With the included app, you can control Kamibot with your Android or iOS smartphone or Tablet. You can easily control Kamibot’s direction, speed, the direction of its head, and the color if its LED lights. You can also set it turning around in endless circles or more complex configurations.Kamibot doesn’t need constant supervision to know what to do. You can use the app to put it in line mode and Kamibot will use the IR sensors on its undercarriage to follow a black line on the ground through complex obstacle courses you create.Kamibot includes a range of sensors that help it move around. These sensors can act independently when in line mode, but you can also program them using Scratch, sending Kamibot on autonomous missions.Kamibot is driven by wheels connected to two, independent DC motors. Kamibot is also equipped with a rotating pad on top, allowing you to control the head-movement of your papercraft character. Kami (紙) is the Japanese word for paper. It is at the root of the word origami (折り紙), literally folding paper. In this spirit, we are constantly expanding the collection of papercraft skins available to print out from our website, to endlessly personalise and customise Kamibot.These include characters we have created and blank templates that you can use to create one-of-a-kind papercraft skins.Magnets can be embedded in the papercraft skins to hold them in place. A servo motor on top allows Kamibot to independently rotate the top section of skins, such as the turret on our tank skin or the head on our Count Dracula skin.Along with your Kamibot, you'll also get a USB-to-micro USB charging cable to keep Kamibot running strong all day.You'll also get the tank papercraft skin, die-cut and in full color. Magnets are embedded in the turret so that you can turn it in any direction. More skins, including all of the ones pictured in the Customize Kamibot section of this page, and DIY skins will be available to download from our website at http://www.kamibot.com/If you buy a single Kamibot set you'll also get a Line Tracing Mat that Kamibot can race around in Line Tracing Mode. If you buy the Twin Pack, you'll also get our Treasure Hunt Mat, too! The Treasure Hunt is one of the activities that kids can program Kamibot to do.Alvin Chae and his co-founder Asaph Kim founded 3.14, the company that makes Kamibot in 2014. Alvin is the company’s CEO and has 10 years of experience as a hardware and software engineer. Asaph is the Chief Design Officer and has a background in animation and 3D design. He attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. Joining him on the design team is graphic designer Harim Yang. They are based in South Korea.We've gotten a lot of questions about the Gundam papercraft skin for Kamibot that we posted on YouTube. You can check it out here:And here's how we built that skin step-by-step:Right now we're working on several licensing deals so that we can bring you cool papercraft designs like this one, officially.Thank you for your Interest in our project!

82,"                        Woobo knows the answers to millions of curious questions. Kids can ask Woobo about things they wonder and Woobo responds in a kid-friendly way to encourage more exploration.  Like a launchpad for learning, Woobo can provide and propose a variety of interactions for kids that encourage curiosity and exploration. Woobo has more than 40 different activities, all of which were crafted and selected carefully for best development values in children. Woobo has a library of high-quality stories and songs carefully selected to encourage wonder and new perspective about the world around them. Who wouldn't want to learn about the planets through song? Woobo always knows the best activities to get kids excited to think creatively and let their imaginations run wild. Woobo can teach kids new skills like different ways to fold a paper airplane or create imaginary monsters together. Sometimes kids can just have fun with Woobo on adventures up in the galaxy or deep in the ocean.   Woobo opens up a window to the many wonders of this world. Kids can explore different cultures, meet a variety of animals, experience many occupations, and get introduced to fun facts that may inspire their interest and curiosity. They may even learn how to say “Hello!” in different languages and surprise you with their newly found knowledge. Woobo encourages not only intellectual challenges but also physical ones to get kids up and moving. Kids can play fun games like Freeze and Obstacle Course with just Woobo, or they can even play more interactive games like Charades and Hot Potato with their friends. Connected to home Wi-Fi or mobile hotspots, Woobo has access to a rich content library online. The online library keeps expanding as Woobo’s content team creates new interactive games and collaborates with top children’s content creators. Woobo can help establish healthy habits by encouraging kids to have fun while doing daily routines like brushing their teeth. With Woobo, getting dressed has never been easier.Kids and parents can send each other voicemails through Woobo, allowing both to always have the opportunity to stay connected. With Woobo’s parenting app on both iOS and Android platforms, parents have more ways to stay connected with their children throughout the day.Daily Routines: With a few simple clicks to set up, Woobo can become a friendly routine reminder for any child and turn morning and nightly routines into something to look forward to.Voicemail: Parents can keep connected with their little ones wherever they are and whenever they want by using the voice messaging functions on both the parenting app and Woobo itselfContent Library: Of course curious kids have curious parents! Parents can access all of Woobo’s content library on the parenting app. Each piece of content is listed with a brief description of what it is and what skills it practices. If a particular piece of content stands out to parents they can request it to be played by their child on Woobo.   Woobo has clickable buttons within each colorful light-up ear! Simply click Woobo’s ear, and when the lights turn blue, Woobo is listening. Ask a question or request something from the library of content like a song, story, game, or joke!Squeezing Woobo’s left hand lets kids view all of the content library. Once the compass on Woobo’s hand is squeezed, the touchscreen on Woobo’s face shifts into an easy-to-use, interactive interface for navigation. Like a little puppy, Woobo has some favorite places to be tickled, rubbed, and scratched. Woobo’s interactive sensors make it so that tickling Woobo on the belly or patting its head will make Woobo happy. Want to see Woobo dizzy? Try shaking Woobo around! Unlike many other Kickstarter projects that are still in concept stage, Woobo has been under development for more than 18 months. We have created tens of iterations of Woobo, focusing on improving both Woobo’s software and hardware. We’ve also conducted interviews with more than 250 parents, and in-person user tests with more than 100 kids to test every small detail in both the interactive experience and educational content design. We are now ready to begin the launch stage and send a limited number of Woobos to live with selected families.Developing a product as new as Woobo requires lots of careful thinking and constant feedback from our potential consumers. Over the past 18 months, we have placed and will continue to place Woobos into homes, playgrounds, and museums.We listen to parents’ opinions, observe how kids play and interact with Woobo, and make improvements.   We believe that the driving force behind lifelong learning is passionate curiosity. The desire to inspire a love of learning is why we began working on a friendly and safe platform for kids to practice asking questions, exploring, and mastering new skills. After studying kids' favorite fluffy and inspiring friends, we created Woobo – a cuddly companion who can encourage, inspire, and answer kids’ inquisitive questions. When kids are free to explore the topics they are interested in, learning can be a blast!With curiosity in mind, we talked with parents and found that we were not the only ones who felt this way! We tested our ideas, listened to feedback from our trials, and developed Woobo’s character with the wants and needs of both kids and parents in mind.Woobo is a team effort between our programmers, technical wizards, amazing designers, and animators…and you! We hope you’ll join us!  Woobo, like your own children, is still growing! When you bring Woobo home through this Kickstarter, you are becoming a member of the growing Woobo community. This means you will get early access to Woobo while we’re still developing. As the first people to bring Woobo home, you will see Woobo continually change and improve in exciting and fun ways. We will frequently be asking for feedback on new games, stories, and other new features that we introduce. As Woobo grows, you will know that your family personally plays an integral role in the successful development of Woobo and its incredible brain.Woobo uses mature mobile hardware to guarantee performance and reliability. Sensors on the body fuel Woobo’s interactive capabilities, and rechargeable batteries allows for 6-8 hours of continuous play on one full charge.  We have gone through three major prototyping stages, tens of iterations, and hundreds of sketches. All efforts in the past 18 months came into shaping the Woobo we know now.Woobo has a hilarious personality designed by our team. Woobo has more than 60 facial expressions with different emotions. More than just laughing and tears, kids always discover many little surprises when interacting with Woobo!We designed a unique, fantastical history for Woobo, which includes a journey filled with amazing adventures from the mystical Woobolaya mountains, the home of all Woobos. Kids can discover fun, hidden details about Woobo’s incredible history simply by chatting with Woobo!  We are collaborating with Shenzhen Valley Ventures (svv.io) for our hardware development and manufacturing. Shenzhen Valley Ventures has a long history of developing mobile devices, smart speakers, and IoT devices. Woobo hardware development and testing has advanced quickly and successfully. Our early prototypes have been working functionally and reliably. We have identified and sourced our key components to ensure that there exists very little uncertainty in our designs and manufacturing process.       Woobo was founded with one goal in mind: to bring children’s imaginary friends to life. Using cutting-edge robotics and artificial intelligence technologies, we strive to provide all children with a smart-companion who can talk, amuse, inspire, and grow alongside them. The team challenged with bringing Woobo to life consists of many talented people across a diverse range of backgrounds. Every day at our office is an intimate collaboration between world-class engineers, designers, educators, and marketers from MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Harvard, Tufts, and the Rhode Island School of Design. We firmly believe this unique mixture of talents is essential in pushing the boundaries of what kids’ toys can truly be.

Thankfully I tried it before putting it under the tree,  When I started it up it was defective.  I contacted support and they notified that there was nothing they could do because their warehouse was closed.  Why would you close your warehouse before the Friday before Christmas when you are promising a Christmas gift?  Can you imagine how disappointed my daughter would have been opening this broken toy?  And although I backed you you are not providing me with support a few days before Christmas?!  I am very sad and disappointed.

83," Control your own Robot Destiny!  BoxBotix lets you build robots that meet your specific needs, and keep them running with parts you can make or source yourself.  To help everyone get started building BBots we are offering two different types of kits:  Bring Your Own Printer as well as Full Frame Kits.  Keep reading for more details on the 130+ high quality parts we provide in our kits.Not into building robots but still want to help?  No worries!  Click on the ""Back This Project"" button and you can elect to help us out with a cash gift, or you can select one of the BoxBotix Kits as an award and donate it to a school or other STEM robotics program.  If you are not sure who would like a kit for their robotics program, we can help with that too!Please remember that Kickstarter is ""all or nothing"", so if we do not reach our goal the BBots and their people do not get funded, and none of our Backers get their awards.Three BBots.  One BrainBox.  There are three BBot variants for the initial release:  BBCopter, BBPlane and BBRover. And that's just the start!  BoxBotix is entirely modular and open source. It all starts with the BrainBox — You then simply mix and match modules to build a robot frame that meets your needs.  And, since it's all open source, you can design and build your own modules.  Want a BBBoat?  BBMonsterTruck?  BBDroid?  Go for it!BoxBotix On GithubDesigned For Manufacture.  On your Desktop.  All of our BoxBotix designs are optimized to be built using readily available tools and materials. The main BBot modules can be printed with a desktop 3D printer. The rest of the materials are metric fasteners, extruded carbon fiber shapes, a bit of aluminum, and EPP foam. They are all built with basic tools you would find in any small shop or hacker space.The worst case scenario we like to design around is the ""At night, in the rain, wearing gloves"" use case. We think we are close to meeting those goals with BoxBotix. All BBots are capable of being built to be water and dust proof — For times when you really shouldn't be out operating, but you are anyway. And all of the connections for the modules are done with thumbscrews, so it's tool-free assembly in the field. From easily printing your own replacement parts, to quickly swapping modules when your landing turns into crash — It all adds up to the ability to sustain your BBots over time.
As you will see from the pictures below, some assembly is required to build your BBot.  You will need items such as epoxy, acetone, a few basic tools, and a bit of patience to build our kits.  If you do not like putting Swedish furniture together this may not be the project for you.Full Frame Kits will include everything you need to build the frame.  We do not include any of the electronics but we will help you choose the items you need.Bring Your Own Printer (BYOP) Kits will include everything BUT the ABS printed parts.  We will even include the ThermoPlastic Elastomer (TPE, it's a rubbery material) printed parts in these kits as printing TPE can be a bit of a challenge.  Please see the parts list below for detailed info.  We have listed some basic specifications for your reference.  It should be noted that the flexible nature of the modular design will let you build these bots in many different configurations.  That makes it hard for us to give any hard numbers.  One of the budget items for our campaign is to build and document more variants so we can supply details on specific builds.Basic Specifications:Basic Specifications:Basic Specifications:We are here on Kickstarter to raise money to do the following:1) Improve Community:  We have started the web site, but it needs more work.  We do most of our web development internally, but it still costs money for hosting and various web services that power the site.  We plan to add a custom forum and knowledge base to the site to make it easier for people to collaborate around new ideas.2) Improve Documentation:  We want to thoroughly document the build and testing of each BBot variant.  This documentation will be provided as build instructions and videos for the open source community.3) Improve Manufacturing:  We want to add more printers to our small print farm, as well as bring in a few more tools such as a vertical band saw.  These additions should double our throughput, assuming we reach our campaign goal.Coby - President.  He generates enough crazy ideas to last two lifetimes.  Amy - Vice President.  She spends most of her time trying to keep Coby focused.Garrett - Engineering.  He has designed and built most of the BoxBotix stuff you see.Aziz - Shop Technician.  He keeps things running in the shop, and otherwise does most of the hard work.The idea for BoxBotix has evolved over the last several years. We run a small shop that machines parts for small robots. We get a lot of emails and phone calls from people trying to integrate new technology and sensors, but lack the robot to put them on.

84," We believe that the arrival of disruptive technologies including hands-free voice control, computer vision, and the Internet of Things (IoT) will change people’s lives for the better. Yet until now, most innovation with this technology has been limited to the home. What if you could access some of the latest in smart robotics technology wherever you go, in or out of the house?PLEN Cube is a portable robot that can consolidate your devices and web services, making them simpler to use and automate; capture moments with a smart camera that tracks your face and motions; and complement your life with hands-free activation and customization options.   And like our previous robot, PLEN2 -- backed here on Kickstarter in 2015 -- PLEN Cube has its own unique character and movements.  Think of PLEN Cube as your right-hand man (in robot form). We’ve packed a lot into this playful 3-inch powerhouse: a powerful processor, Full-HD camera, display, microphone array and speakers, along with cutting-edge software in facial recognition, speech recognition, and more.  Simply use voice commands to take a photo or video. PLEN Cube uses computer vision technology to follow you wherever you go. Photographers -- this is the “follow me” mode you’ve been looking for!  PLEN Cube can even rotate 360 degrees to take a panoramic photo. Because it is wifi and bluetooth-enabled, you can instantly share photos or live stream videos on social media, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. PLEN Cube aggregates all your day’s essential info including the weather, schedule, reminders, social media and more. Use PLEN Cube’s accompanying mobile app to connect it to the web services you use everyday. PLEN Cube will keep you informed through its display, movements, sound, or notifications to your mobile device.  What good is a smart home if accessing your devices is a pain? PLEN Cube has access to a database of thousands of IR home appliances and many wireless smart home devices. All you have to do is tell it the maker and model, and you can control your gadgets with simple voice or gesture commands.Anyone who meets PLEN Cube does the same thing: smile! PLEN Cube has plenty of charm and personality. It will face you when you speak, give a little shake when it wakes up and sleeps, nod its head as it ponders -- even dance to your music. We designed PLEN Cube to be a versatile companion that doesn’t lock you into one type of communication. It can pick up on multiple cues and can communicate in multiple ways, resulting in a wider spectrum of commands and actions.  More ways to understand Voice activation is great, but can be limiting for a number of reasons -- a loud room, an accented voice, a sleeping baby. PLEN Cube can be activated by voice, gesture, and your smartphone.More ways to communicate  PLEN Cube has multiple “outputs” including the ability to play music, control home devices, and display information. It can also be understood immediately with “body language” and audiovisual cues.   Anyone can customize PLEN Cube’s behavior with IFTTT, a web-based automation platform that allows you to trigger chains of actions based on events from your favorite web services. You can use PLEN Cube’s expanded capabilities with all the info and tasks that are important to you, whether that’s weather, appointments, fitness stats, news alerts, social media and more. The possibilities are truly endless. Here are just a few ways you can use PLEN Cube throughout the day:For Developers 

Developers can access our open API and take customization to the next level. We’ll also launch a community forum where users can share ideas and collaborate.For DesignersIt’s also possible to customize the look of your PLEN Cube, as we will be releasing 3D data and printing tips for the outer cover. The possibilities are infinite, though here are some fun ideas: wheels or tank treads for a rugged PLEN Cube. Or a mesh or transparent body for that uber-robot look. Have fun with this one! Just push a button, and your PLEN Cube will come to life! You can customize your settings, services and devices using the PLEN Cube mobile app, and use IFTTT or the developer API to create custom automated actions.      Unmatched Ease, Versatility and FunctionPLEN Cube is the only product on the market that brings all these functionalities in one device, in a convenient portable size, at this price.   Technical SpecsIntel Joule SoMWiFi, Bluetooth2.2-inch 320x240 full color LCD displayFull HD Camera - with panoramic photos and face and action tracking Microphone x2  - with sound source localizationElectromagnetic field-based gesture sensor - detects hand presence and motion.

We’d like to think the PLEN Cube is simple, elegant -- even delightful. Just watch -- your friends will love it when PLEN Cube first lifts its “head” to listen and respond to you. Our first release will have a white top and black bottom -- a color scheme that will match any setting. If we reach our stretch goal of $150,000, we’ll also offer PLEN Cube in blue and white. You’ll be able to choose which color option you’d like at the end of the campaign. PLENGoer Robotics is the collaboration between PLEN Project Company, with over a decade’s experience creating groundbreaking robots, and GoerTek, one of the world’s leading electronics manufacturers and supplier to today’s top consumer electronics companies. As a team, we have the best of both worlds: pioneering, scrappy developers and world leaders in electronics.The story of PLEN Cube starts in 2005, when we launched PLEN, a walking humanoid robot using precision metal parts normally used for aircrafts and railway vehicles -- and the only robot who could skateboard. PLEN was met with immediate media attention and was even inducted into the Hall of Fame in Austria’s Ars Electronica, the “Museum of the Future”.   In 2015, we launched the open source, 3D-printable robot PLEN2, the world’s smallest bipedal walking robot . The amazing Kickstarter community -- you! -- helped us beat our goal, raise over $65,000, and ship PLEN2 robots around the world. We’re based in Japan, which is in the midst of a robot renaissance. Japan is the oldest nation in the world, with more than 25% of the population 65 or older. The number of caregivers can’t keep up, and hackers and developers are busy tackling this problem, re-imagining how robots can make a difference in our lives morning, noon and night.We consider ourselves part of this movement, and we’re taking it one step further. How can robots help us now, every day? A robot can help an elderly person gain autonomy … a busy person gain time … a photographer gain followers … a family gain stronger connections. For us, this is what robots are about.When we launched PLEN2 on Kickstarter in 2015, we assumed the community would be great. But they were more than great -- they became like partners and collaborators, helping us shape the product in ways that made the PLEN2 even stronger.
 We believe that the best products happen when you listen to and engage with your community. We’ve already debuted a PLEN Cube prototype at CES and have introduced it to several tech spaces across the United States. We made the product, but the community is what gives it life. Thank you so much for checking out the PLEN Cube -- we can’t wait to make this happen and appreciate all your support.  Is PLEN Cube secure? Security is very important to us and will be a major consideration as we continue to refine our product. We will use a Linux operating system specific to IoT and connected devices. Such an OS is designed with security as a top priority. We will also build user authentication for features like video streaming and social network integration etc. Voice clips will be temporarily stored for processing by the speech recognition engine, but will not be stored long-term. All network communications will be encrypted and all usage statistics, diagnostics, etc, will be securely stored by us with a trusted 3rd party cloud service provider.  For how long will PLEN Cube hold its charge? We are still fine-tuning this. We anticipate that PLEN Cube will hold its charge for 2 weeks in hibernate mode (nothing is active and one must push the button to wake it), and 30 minutes while using the action camera, tracking, and livestreaming. Intermediate activity level will likely be in the range of 2-5 hours. I’m a member for the press. How can I reach you about a possible article? Thank you for thinking of us! We'd love to share more.

Now, they are taught at thousands of K-12 schools, and the world's top universities and programs:We’re bringing Hubert the Humanoid to Kickstarter to help teach advanced robotics - the latest and greatest in modern robotics. Hubert runs on and teaches the same robotics used by cutting-edge university research labs and top robotics companies.

 Similar robots are currently available and used, but start at 10x the price of Hubert. We’re making a full suite of college-level robotics lessons cheaper than the cost of a single college robotics class - and you get to keep the robot.
 With in-depth, free web tutorials we’ll host on the ArcBotics website in all these subjects and more, you’ll be a robotics engineer in no time. Just as with our other past robots, we’ll also continue to develop new lessons for Hubert over time.
We designed Hubert around our Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) philosophy, making all top-grade components easily accessible. The underlying aluminum metal bracket system provides plenty of mounting points, which the OSHW electronics and sheet metal covers are mounted to. All parts are only a few screws away.

 Hubert includes:
 To bring a robot like this down from research lab prices, we had to start from scratch on each and every component. Servos are usually the single biggest expense, so we focused the most on them.  We started by sampling dozens of different RC servos from experienced factories, took the best one we could find, and totally re-built it to be our own ideal servo. Our custom controller board packs the same power as an Arduino inside each and every servo. Combined with additional control and sensing circuitry, it’s a dream servo at a bargain price.We want to make Hubert easy to learn with, and that means making it easy to hack on as well. We designed Hubert to use defacto standard components and systems. No custom arcane interfaces, weird connectors, or crippled, under-developed Linux boards. We use community standards that are easy to support and learn - and actually useful when you want to apply them elsewhere. 
Another advantage to this approach is that it’s inherently future-proof. All computer features are driverless USB devices connected via an USB hub, and the screen is an HDMI device. As long as computers use USB and HDMI, you’ll be able to use Hubert.Current research-grade robots are laboriously handmade and assembled, without care for cost. ArcBotics has been exploring manufacturing techniques for producing this robot for years. 
We haven’t forgotten about our original Hexy the Hexapod customers! 5 years later, and we’re still thinking about you. ;)Hubert’s servo control board (available for purchase separately) will be backwards-compatible with Hexy, and our upgraded PoMoCo 3.0 software and app will feature full backwards-compatibility with Hexy’s Servotor32 controller. You’ll even be able to use the same code we’re developing for Hubert for Hexy, and most of the tutorials will apply backwards as well. That said, stay tuned - Hexy the Hexapod 2.0 is next!
ArcBotics is a small, independent robotics company, entirely funded through Kickstarter and our direct sales.
 Our next step is to move from our working prototype to a ready-for-manufacturing prototype, then we can move to a mass production run. Given all the custom and numerous components that make up Hubert, this is a significant investment in terms of time, securing all the components that have large MOQs (minimum order quantities) like our custom servos (good thing there’s a lot per robot!), and  manufacturing our custom metal brackets, servos, and more. Your support in this campaign will help us go through this final and crucial stage.
 It will also require our team to go to Asia to oversee manufacturing and QC processes. Luckily, we already have extensive experience doing this, as we moved to Asia for almost 2 years after our last Kickstarter for Sparki to source and supervise all of our partners. We already have our own final small parts, QC, and final assembly factory, as well as a network of other partner factories we already work with for our multiple other products. 
 We just need your support now to make Hubert the Humanoid into a reality!
We are proud of the long-term relationships we have developed with 20 global retailers including Barnes and Noble, Adafruit, and RobotShop.  We have been honored to receive awards for our educational robotics work, including:
 We are extremely proud of our amazing global open source community, and all that they have done with Hexy and Sparki.

86," We have started rebuilding Eric and conserving Inhka, and will be sharing this journey through regular updates with you, our backers. We are also busy preparing fantastic rewards and will send these out later this year. You’ll be able to see Eric for free at the Science Museum in October 2016, once he is completed. Eric and Inhka will then star in our major Robots exhibition, which will explore the remarkable 500-year story of humanoid robotics when it opens in February 2017. Stay up to date with Eric and Inhka as part of the Robots exhibition by signing up to our email newsletter. ...Hello Kickstarter, I’m curator Ben Russell and my dream is to rebuild the UK’s first robot, Eric. Built in 1928, Eric holds a unique place in our history. He was everything we now imagine a robot to be – a talking, moving mechanical person. But then Eric disappeared and no-one knows what happened to him.Now with your support the Science Museum and expert roboticist Giles Walker will rebuild Eric based on original archive materials.You can help save Eric for the nation as part of the Science Museum's permanent collection. Eric will go on public display for everyone to see for free in October 2016 for a month before he stars in the Museum's major Robots exhibition opening in February 2017. The exhibition (and Eric) will also visit Manchester in the UK and a number of international museums as part of a 5 year tour. If we reach £50,000 we’ll also be able to preserve and care for the incredible Inhka.  

 This mischievous robotic receptionist greeted visitors to King’s College London from 2003 until 2014, dispensing directions, information and attitude with a cocky tilt of her head.Inhka was one of only three ever built, and the only one of her kind to interact with the public for so long. Now retired from the reception desk at King’s, we want to re-animate Inhka, helping preserve her for future generations to enjoy.    Reaching our £50,000 stretch goal will enable us to replace Inhka’s motors and update her software so she moves smoothly. We’ll upgrade her hardware so she can maintain her behaviours and physical functions, ensuring that the technology that controls her doesn’t go obsolete. Inhka will also be cleaned and made ready to greet visitors again. 

 After we complete our conservation work, Inhka will join Eric in our 2017 Robots exhibition. Thanks to you, Inhka will once again interact with the public, enjoying banter with visitors and even offering fashion advice.    So join our campaign and help bring both Eric and Inhka back to life. Listen here as the QI elves share Eric's story in the hilarious No Such Thing As A Fish podcast, hear Ben Russell’s interview on NPR (US public radio) and read about our dream to rebuild Eric in Hyperallergic, Popular Science, Wired UK, VICE (Motherboard), BBC News, The Daily Telegraph, London Evening Standard, Financial Times, MailOnline, ArsTechnica UK, CNET, Engadget, Gizmag and more.Originally built by Captain W. H. Richards & A.H. Reffell, Eric was one of the world’s first robots. Created less than a decade after the word robot was first used, Eric was quintessentially British and deemed an almost perfect man by the New York press.Eric's first public performance was on 20 September 1928, when he opened the Society of Model Engineers' annual exhibition 'with a really sparkling speech'. The society had originally invited the Duke of York to open the event but he declined, so Captain W. H. Richards decided as 'it is a mechanical show, let us have a mechanical man to open it' and started work on creating Eric.You can read more about Eric's story in a new blog from curator Ben Russell, in an interview with Hyperallergic or in this original 1928 article in Popular Science Monthly.   Eric was built at a time when robots had just become part of popular culture. The word 'robot' was first introduced to the English language in R.U.R., a 1920 play by Czech writer Karel Čapek. R.U.R. stands for Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti (Rossum’s Universal Robots). These letters can be seen on Eric's chest.He weighed just over 45 kg and had a 'armour-plated chest, legs and arms' made of Aluminium. Eric had light bulbs for eyes and 35,000 volts of electricity caused blue sparks to fly from his teeth.   Crowds were wowed by Eric, he charmed dignitaries and celebrities as he travelled the globe with his makers, visiting the UK, US and Europe.Then Eric disappeared. Was he lost, destroyed or recycled for spare parts? No-one knows. But you can be part of bringing Eric back to life. For over 100 years at the Science Museum in London, we’ve been collecting and caring for thousands of incredible objects and sharing their amazing stories. From steam engines that tell the story of industry and change, to spacecraft like Apollo 10 that helped humanity explore new horizons.Although robots are large, heavy, solid things, they have always tended to be rather ephemeral. Robots are working objects and tend to get cannibalised for spare parts, lost, neglected, forgotten about, or deliberately scrapped.      To make sure the fascinating stories of these incredible robots can be told, the Science Museum has rescued a number of relatively recent robots from sheds, basements and other forgotten places and will care for them for the nation. Many of these robots (and Eric) will go on display in our 2017 Robots exhibition. 
Our dream to rebuild Eric began when we stumbled across Eric’s remarkable story while researching our upcoming Robots exhibition. We tracked down the relatives of Eric's original creators and they have helped us to gather enough original imagery to bring him back to life.We’ve commissioned expert roboticist Giles Walker to rebuild Eric in the UK. Giles has already made working drawings based on archive materials and discussions with curator Ben Russell. 

Building EricIt will take about three months to rebuild Eric and we are ready to begin. The first stage is to build Eric’s internal metal frame which will support his aluminium skin and the electronics and motors which will allow him to move. Once the motors and wiring are added and tested, aluminium will be cut and applied to form Eric’s skin. Finally the frame and aluminium will be cleaned and the electronics and software which will control Eric's movements will be added and tested.Although Eric’s external appearance is relatively easy to establish from photographs taken during his lifetime and some of his movements can be seen in surviving film footage, reverse-engineering Eric's insides will be a far more difficult challenge.

The only image of Eric's insides is from an artist’s impression, which may (or may not) be accurate as Eric’s makers didn’t want to give too much away. Although we will use modern components inside Eric, we still have much experimenting to do to ensure that Eric moves like the original. Eric will be built in south London by roboticist Giles Walker, with support and advice from curator Ben Russell.
Ben is Curator of Mechanical Engineering at the Science Museum and is lead curator for the Robots exhibition. Ben has curated many exhibitions at the Museum and has also published a book, James Watt: Making the World Anew. As well as advising on the rebuild of Eric, he is also writing a book on the history of humanoid robotics to accompany the exhibition.Giles is a scrap artist and roboticist who has been transforming industrial waste into fully functional robots for over 20 years. His work ranges from bringing old robots back to life to creating robots for music festivals. As a member of the prolific guerilla-art group The Mutoid Waste Company, Giles' work has been exhibited across the world, touring in Europe, Japan, Australia, Russia and Ukraine. His two cyborg pole dancers, a work entitled Peepshow, were featured in an exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. Back our campaign and you will be able to see Eric on display for free in the Museum from October 2016 for a month.He will then feature as one of the stars of our Robots exhibition in 2017 before he travels the world with the exhibition, just like the original did almost 90 years ago. Eric will visit Manchester, UK, and a number of international venues as part of the 5-year exhibition tour. Eric will then return to the Museum as part of our permanent collection. This is your chance to help rebuild a part of history, to bring one of the earliest robots ever made back to life and help Eric inspire future generations across the world.Join us and be part of this amazing project to bring Eric back to life. With your support, we can all make our dream of rebuilding Eric a reality.  We have some fantastic rewards for you, our backers.

The exhibition will explore how robots and society have been shaped by religious belief, the industrial revolution, popular culture and dreams about the future. Set in five different periods and places, this major exhibition will feature a unique collection of over 100 robots, from a 16th-century mechanical monk to robots from science fiction and modern-day research labs. Among many other highlights will be an articulated iron manikin from the 1500s, Cygan, a 2.4m tall 1950s robot with a glamorous past, and one of the first walking bipedal robots. Eric was one of the first robots ever built and his incredible story deserves to be told.

 QuadBot is a 3D Printable, programmable walking robot.     QuadBot was created so that anyone can get into Making Robotics! It's super engaging and fun to program, but it's also open source and loaded with complex algorithms, making it ideal for:The best way to learn? Have an idea and then make it real. See what makers have come up with!   QuadBot can walk, dance, light up and with sensors it can follow you, avoid obstacles, play songs... anything is possible!But the real value is the open-ness of QuadBot. Rather than limit you to only a few behaviours, we've opened up the entire code and design so you can hack it to do anything. That means if you want to learn basic robotics, you can follow our standard guide, but when you're ready to activate super maker mode, you can break-out and use QuadBot to explore robotics.
 

 Do you want to 3D Print your own robot or do you want a robot ready out of the box? Do you want to get them early or in bulk?The Full Kit is for those who want to assemble QuadBot right away. Maybe you want to get straight into learning embedded coding for robotics. If you want to go wireless, select the Full Kit + Bluetooth option. The Maker Kit is for those who have access to a 3D Printer. This kit reduces the cost and means you can customise and print parts yourself (All our designs are open source!).      QuadBot is designed for any level of experience. It works out of the box (after some fun assembly) and can be programmed using graphical blocks, ideal for young makers. However every aspect of QuadBot can be customised and changed, from the 3D Design down to a single line of C++ code, opening it up to experienced makers.QuadBot was made for you to do real deal robotics. This means that you learn coding techniques that are scalable to bigger and better projects, rather than an oversimplified and limited alternative (such as Lego Mindstorms). A robotics platform that sets up young and experienced makers like this has not existed until right now.How does QuadBot compare with other robots? QuadBot is free from unwanted sensors, making it more affordable and giving makers the freedom to choose their own.Our learning resources will guide you, without getting in the way of savvy makers who already know how they are going to use QuadBot. Robotics is all about hands on experience, that's why we made QuadBot. Using it you will learn about the five tenets of Robotics. To really know robotics you need well structured and engaging learning resources. So we're creating just that, a series of interactive exercises that take you from assembling QuadBot all the way to complex robotic movement algorithms.Our learning resources require NO prior knowledge, and use free, open-source software.    We designed QuadBot in Autodesk Fusion 360 specifically so that you can customise and change the design. This is a maker product so we want you to design and share!    The smarts in the software. QuadBot is crammed with functionality thanks to thousands of lines of code. But to make it easy, we've hidden it all away behind super-simple programming blocks. This makes QuadBot accessible to anyone - even those with no experience in coding!Once you're ready to progress to more functionality, you can go into text code. It's all written up as a fully documented, easy to use Arduino library. We've made it so that the transition from blocks to text is as simple as possible!   You can dig deeper into the code and use the kinematics and algorithm code, no aspect of QuadBot's behaviour has been hidden away. We used LabVIEW to help us write QuadBot's core code. We created different simulations of QuadBot to find the best movement algorithms. This allowed us to quickly test and tweak without needing the physical robot (and risking a robot self-destruct!).Because it is such a useful tool, we are creating a LabVIEW driver to allow others to simulate QuadBot and try movements in LabVIEW. This enables academic institutions to use QuadBot and LabVIEW for teaching practical and theory-based robotics!  Most robots are a messy hodge-podge of wires and boards. Not QuadBot. We've designed the QuadBoard - integrated robotics hardware that is also the mechanical frame of QuadBot.It's fully compatible with the Arduino platform (that includes shields) and has loads of other features like.   No more fiddling with separate modules. One board, everything robotics. Assembling the robot is a piece of cake. Thanks to 3D Printing, we've designed custom parts that minimise screws and simplify construction. You can put it together in between one to two hours. QuadBot Mk.1 was designed for the University of Manchester Robotics Society in 2013. These early QuadBots were made with laser cutting, and then developed further with 3D Printing.     The mechanical design we have so far is fully functional, but we'll be changing the design slightly to iron out small pain points. We've got a number of small-scale manufacturers who will 3D Print the robots for us, and the option to use injection moulding if we get more demand. The delivery time we've estimated for this is two months, which falls well inside our delivery deadline of April 2017. Our QuadBoard PCBs have been stress-tested over months of use and we have several manufacturers lined up with which we have a successful history.We expect all our parts to be manufactured by late February, meaning delivery should be completed by mid-March...for safety, we've allowed until early April, with shipping. International Buyers (Outside UK and EU) - We're running our kickstarter responsibly, so we're not marking rewards as gifts. Buyers will be responsible for import taxes and customs. Colors? Our initial plan is to ship only the black and white version of the robot (affectionately know as Panda). However depending on  feedback and quantity, we may offer other colors.  Of course if you are 3D printing your own parts, then you can use any color or material you like!      ",EngiMake,"£48,181",Unstated,"A Real Robotics platform accessible to beginners and experts.

We backed a maker kit, but they want to know if maker kit can be paired with blue tooth option. If so how to add it to our pledge? Thanks.~Hi Josh, that would be cool to have that choice. I've noticed in the concept drawings in the kickstarter clip (at 1:43) some examples which might do just fine (with a more flatten dome).~Hi! I'm very excited to back this project. I'm wondering if you would made several top cases/covers to select from or provide as addon or via extended goals? These eyes make it attractive for kids but it would be more fun to foresee some mounting capabilities in the standard cover (for instance to extend it with that laser as demoed). It seems the top isn't flat and drilling holes through it might not be the preferred option for those like me who don't have access to a 3D printer.~Considering that the robot can place it's belly on the floor, it would be cool to mount a wireless power induction cable on the bottom of the robot. Robots are often run in trials in the labs I've worked with, so placing it on a charging mat would be a bit nicer than plugging a cable in and the robot has a nice feature to make a good contact i.e. it can ""sit down"" on a charging mat.~Congratulations lads, I didn't think you'd have trouble raising this when I met you at Big Data LDN and I'm pleased to see that you've smashed through it.~",0.0,"£12,500",QuadBot - Now ANYONE can Master Robotics by EngiMake — Kickstarter
88," Robots are the next big platform. We've all dreamed of a world where robots interact with and help humans in their daily lives. But the reality is, robots have a long way to go. Limited access, due to robots being either too expensive and complex or too simplistic, has kept innovators, explorers and the masses at bay.Enter HEXA, the first of a new generation of accessible, programmable robots. HEXA is a 6-legged, highly maneuverable, compact robot that comes complete with all the necessary sensors. Along with HEXA, we deliver MIND, a robotics OS and SDK, where for the first time individuals don't need to know underlying hardware and complex mechanics to learn and create interesting robotics functionality. HEXA is agile, smart and compact enough to fit in your backpack. HEXA has a high degree of maneuverability, to deliver versatility of movements and actions, and can nimbly handle different environments and terrains. This is the ideal robotic body to start creating on. HEXA’s optical and spatial sensors allow it to watch and learn from the world around it, and allow you to create interesting and intelligent functionality. Sensors include: 720P camera with night vision; 3-axis accelerometer; distance measuring sensor; infrared transmitter.MIND is based on the Linux kernel and is optimized for robots. It integrates various libraries and drivers to easily control the robot hardware and network. With MIND, you create movements and applications that bring your robotic ideas to life.With MIND, you choose how you want to develop and build, using either a Golang-powered SDK or a sandbox-style 3D Simulator. MIND is a complete robotics ecosystem, including a user-generated Skills Store, where you can share your latest Skill or play around, testing out the Skills of your fellow robot-enthusiasts and HEXA owners. For the first time, people have the ability to create, explore and invent on robotics. This is your stepping stone into the fast growing field of robotics. Will you be a pioneer in robotics? Will you build new robot functionality that helps to advance the future of robots? To accelerate progress with robotics, we need more innovators. Today, HEXA is still young. But the possibilities are endless for what you can create and do with this mighty platform and robot. Here are a few ideas and creations from our early HEXA users, whom we call ""Human Mentors"":Help us get to $300,000 and everyone who backs a HEXA receives this cool little Infrared Code Reader. How it works: Plug our code reader into your HEXA and it can learn the code of your other remote controls (i.e. TV remote, AC remote, stereo remote, etc.). HEXA will then learn to transmit the same code from these remotes.
Here's a use case: Point your TV remote at HEXA, pressing 'power off' on the remote. HEXA will learn this code and then be able to shut down the TV. Make it more interesting and program HEXA, teaching it things like 'shut down TV if owner is found asleep.'  You can help us by sharing our KS page with friends and community.For the past three years, we’ve been building the hardware and software for HEXA and MIND. We’ve gone through countless iterations. We’ve built from scratch our own motors for HEXA, our own joints for the legs. The list goes on. And now, we’re ready to take it mainstream!During the development of HEXA, we launched a program called '2048 Human Mentors' getting our robot in the hands of our first batch of owners. While we had a limited number of HEXAs, we were pleased at the response, with thousands of people applying to purchase. We thank you, our first Human Mentors, for all of the work you've put into teaching and growing our little robot and helping to start our community!Now, we are crowdfunding in order to mass produce HEXA, bringing down the cost and making it more accessible to the masses.We’re a hardworking, robot-loving, big-dreaming team of roboticists, industrial designers, neuroscientists, data crunchers and builders. We hope you’ll back our Kickstarter in order to help take HEXA mainstream and fuel the next wave of robot inventors!Please note: After crowdfunding, we expect that HEXA will be back to its earlier price of $999.As well as the following extras:Use our App to control your robot remotely.

Perfect packaging !~@Steve: While HEXAs have indeed arrived in Europe, due to the bad weather throughout Europe they've been stationed and not yet dispatched with UPS. We expect you to have updated and accurate shipping information in the next few days, as the UPS pickup is expected soon. Thank you for your patience. And again, apologies that the tracking information has been unclear.~@PattyI've tried logging in to the vincross website but it doesn't show my order - says you have no past orders. If I check the status on the UPS Tracking site using the tracking number I got in the email saying HEXA is on its way it's not changed since 30/11  saying Order processed Ready for UPS . If I click the order detail in the email I got from Vincross saying HEXA is on its way it shows no such order.I don't know if it makes any difference but my email address isn't all lower case whereas in my account on the vincross site its been stored all in lower case although I seem to be able to log in using either.~@PattyI logged into vincross.com,  followed the trail through to ups.com and pasted in the tracking ID.It's been saying ""Order Processed: Ready for US"" since Dec 01. Has it been passed to UPS?~Please note that you'll need to login to our website (www.vincross.com) to see the status of the order. Your user ID is your email used with the Kickstarter order and you'll need to set a password.~@GeorgeI don't know if it's normal,  but I'm in the same boat. Shipping to the U.K.~30/11/2017 11:19Order Processed: Ready for UPS~Hi, I'm in Europe but the website still shows ""Order not found"" when I click the link in my email.  The comments below suggest European orders have been shipped.  Can you advise please?~Logged in, still show me “Order not found.” Delivering by: debang Tracking #: 5553863940 I used my Beijing, China address~Thank you, Andy. I received the tracking yesterday and it looks like it's scheduled to reach me next week already. Wooohoooo...!!~@Javier, HEXAs that are shipping to the US are currently on-freight and will be arriving in port in the US this month. So fear not, you wouldn't have received a tracking number yet if you're a US backer. We'll get these to you just as soon as possible and will keep backers informed on when the freight arrives.~Hi Hexa team I haven't received a tracking number yet I am in the US. Can you resend it to me if it was already sent?~Hey Khairulnizam! You should have your tracking number already in your email inbox, however it might ends up in your spam box. Sorry for the inconvenience. You can contact support@vincross.com if you want us to send you the order number and tracking number again. Thanks! Andy.~Hi Rokeyzhang, thanks for letting us know. Currently you'll need to login to www.vincross.com with your kickstarter-registered email address and visit the order link again. We'll improve the website process to give you a more seamless experience soon. Thanks again. Andy.~I received the mail, but followed link or tracking No. shows nothing... https://www.vincross.com/en/order/detail/20171204674707~I'm in Asia region & among the earliest backers (<10), and I've yet to receive any tracking?~Thank you Patty!~Hi Backers -  A note of clarification on shipments, tracking numbers and email notifications. We're preparing bulk shipments and expect that people will get their tracking number in arbitrary order; getting a tracking number just means that we registered your HEXA in the carriers' system, which doesn't mean the product is shipped out. We'll post another update when the products are actually shipped out.~Received my tracking number on 01/12 , but parcel is a lways in your facility.When will it left china ?~@Patty, I'm in Europe and haven't received a tracking number either?~@Jacob G - I'll message you privately with your tracking number.~@Patty I am located in Europe, and I didn't get any tracking number yet?~@George, shipments are coming from Asia.~Hi @Isaiah, orders were shipped to Europe at the end of last week and those backers were notified via email from Vincross with package tracking number. For US orders, your HEXAs are currently on freight en route to the US and we'll notify you once they hit land. For all other regions, you can also expect an email from us at Vincross with the tracking number once the robot has been shipped.~Hello everyone,~Hello. One quick question. from where are you shipping Hexa? Europe,Asia,USA? Regards.~when is my shipment inland？~Hexa has been sent today :). sure a very careful and affectionate UPS carrier brings Hexa in perfect condition and happy to my home.~Yes! Got my UPS Shippment information today! Looking forward start playing with Hexa.~Yes, it's all in the pledge section.~Never mind, it's on the pledge if anyone's wondering. I already had it filled out, just forgot.~How are we supposed to get our addresses to you?~any updates?~Is there a way to add the infrared receiver for extra $9.90 to the shipment?Because if I try to order one in your shop I get $150 shipping cost just for the receiver.~@creators...I like to ask you about the shipping costs too. 150$ for shipping to Germany is a real BIG amount. I order serval heavier and bigger things from all over the world and it was cheaper and still insured. Will you be able to reduce shipping costs?~Hey. Will you be able to reduce shipping costs for canada?~Can it go into a mode where it just wanders around on its own like a pet? With the wireless charging, I'd like to have it able to just wander on its own, and allow direct control when I want. Then go back to the base when it has nearly run out of juice.~I made my way to the Vincross site and noticed that you have ""all metal"" servos for sale. Can you provide more information about those? There are no details on the site. For instance, what are the benefits to the metal servos? In what scenario would you want them? I assume they are higher quality and more durable, using metal pinions instead of plastic, but under what conditions would this added durability be necessary?~Looks like you fixed it Andy. I'm able to log in again on the website and app.~@HiLuckyB, Good catch! Thanks for the feedback. We've fixed the issue which is caused by capital letters in the email address. Please try again.~There seems to be a problem with your login on the website, And the app. I can't login, Says my password is wrong. If I try to reset the password, It says Invalid verification code. So I tried a different email, And the same problem Invalid verification code when trying to make a new account. Any idea why this is happening?~Thinks the shipping will be 50$ , it's the real price for this king of parcel ;-)~Hi,I would love to see where the Hexa will be shipped all over the world.Do you have any statistics by country ?~Hi,Congratulations for this campaign !I am very excited by this project. Can't wait to play with it.I wish long live to Hexa :)~Hi Francois, yes we do expect the final shipping cost to be $150. Sorry that this may be more than you expected.~",0.0,"$100,000","HEXA: Programmable, Highly Maneuverable Robot by Tianqi Sun — Kickstarter"
89,"   Biology, Physics, Mathematics, Psychology, Design, Art, all of these are components of robotics. No other discipline is so multidisciplinary. Robotics provides an outlet for every student, the builders, the engineers, the creatives. They all can get something from robotics.Besides that, robotics is just plain cool. Nothing else makes kids' eyes light up like a robot. That is why were are working to create these robotic STEM kits to get kids excited about technology and its possibilities. Bigger is Better.At Slant we have spent the last year or so working with robot arms for education. The best known of these is the LittleArm. But the LittleArm is small. As kids move forward with robotics the LittleArm does not have the capabilities to keep kids interested into high school and university. We had to create something larger with more potential for practical applications. So we created the LittleArm Big. A Robot that is designed for upper-level education but has the potential to be used in practical settings, such as the Maker's workbench or even in the home prepping toast in the morning.The LittleArm Big is a large-sized Arduino robot arm. It has been designed to be a desktop robot arm that is fun and even practical but also reliable as an educational tool in higher level robotics education.The Big, is beefy. There is really no other way to describe it. We have designed the arm to take some abuse.High Strength Metal Gear ServosWe do not try and skimp on performance. All the servo motors in the arm are metal-geared. This allows for maximum strength, performance, and resilience. The servos give the arm a maximum lifting capacity of 0.25 pounds, fully extended.3D Printed Lightweight Rugged Design3D printing allows the creation of strong, but incredibly lightweight components. Molding can't match it. A 3D printer is also one of the most common maker tools, making the Big highly accessible. At Slant we have been mass producing components with 3D printers for some time. When we designed the Big, we designed it specifically for 3D printers from the very beginning. We are not just creating robots we are creating the processes and procedures to use 3D printing in commercial manufacturing.Simple and Interchangeable GripperThe Gripper of the Big is a very simple device. In fact we are about as proud of the 3 piece design of the gripper as any other part of the LittleArm Big.Not only is our gripper elegant and simple but we decided to make it interchangable. If you want to swap our gripper for another, just slide ours off and slide on another of your own design.The Software of the LittleArm BIG is designed to be very easy to use so that beginners and kids as young as 6 years old can get started with it. Desktop ApplicationUsing the GUI, users can move the joints of the Big simply by using the sliders in the GUI. Waypoints can then be recorded to generate an entire sequence that can be played back. Currently the Desktop application works only with Windows, but we will be expanding to Apple in the near future.Android AppThe Android application for the Big is an simplified version of the desktop software. It connects to a bluetooth-enabled LittleArm Big and allows control and recording of motion sequences.SpeechThe Big does have speech capabilities. There are several dedicated files which correspond to commands such as ""Up,"" ""down,"" ""rotate base,"" But there are also files which can contain user generated sequences. These files can then be edited by the user and triggered with keywords such as ""Task One.""The Speech system is very accurate since it is powered by Google's cloud speech recognition.We will be expanding on this in the future to make it more adaptable but for now we consider it a ""maker-level"" feature.The LittleArm Big is powered by  the Arduino (specifically an Arduino Nano). This is a great advantage because it offers huge possibilities to the Open-Source community. The Arduino platform also allows programming of the arm with tools such as BlocklyDuino, a graphical programming language similar to scratch.We have also implemented the electronics so that they offer maximum expandability. The primary control board allows for multiple analog inputs and can accommodate more servos for specialty end effectors.Expansion OptionsBluetoothEvery LittleArm BIG has a bluetooth module included which can be used in place of standard USB communication. The Module does have to be connected manually.Additional ServosDepending on what you decide to use the Big for you might need even more actuation, for this reason we ensured that there are several additional ports for control and powering of Servos.6 Analog/Digital InputsThe Big is natively an open-loop system. Yes the servos have some internal feedback, but they can't really sense the world. There are several additional ports available which can provide trigger data or monitoring of some of the joints.Gripper Kit - Gripper for Your ProjectsAll 3D printed parts, fasteners, and the servo to build the full LittleArm Big Gripper that you can use with your own projects.Maker Kit - Print Your Own PartsAll of the servos, electronics, wiring, and fasteners that you need to build the Arm. We will also send you the STL files for 3D printing at the end of the campaign.Full Kit - Build the Full Arm YourselfEverything you need to build a fully functional LittleArm BIG, from the 3D printed parts to the power supply. Note: Due to volume constraints we are only providing US and EU style power supplies. If the campaign grows larger we will provide other styles.Fully Assembled LittleArm BIG - Plug and GoA Fully assembled LittleArm Big. Just plug in the power cord and USB with the free desktop app. To implement Bluetooth you must connect it manually inside of the control box.The LittleArm Big is the 3rd generation of LittleArm Family. The LittleArm project began as a weekend garage project to play with the Arduino. But soon STEM teachers were requesting that it be turned into a Kit. So Slant Concepts took on the project and started growing it.Today the LittleArm is the first commercially successful 3D printed robot arm and one of the premier STEM kits in the world. We want to keep that going by providing quality STEM kits to students and Makers all over the world. We want to get kids excited about technology and keep them excited about it. ",Slant Robotics,"$11,222",Unstated,"A 3D Printed Desktop Robotic Arm, based on Arduino, for Hobbyists and Education at all Levels",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,88 ," 2 questions.

90," If you missed the chance to get Wink on Kickstarter, please visit our website at www.plumgeek.com  We will have Wink for sale via our online store in January or February 2016. If you are an educator who would like to use Wink for your classroom or workshop we would really like to hear from you.And thanks to more than 1,300 of you who came out to support us! We are so incredibly grateful for your outstanding support. Thank you for giving us an opportunity to launch the Wink project. We love you!!Wink is an Arduino based robot designed to help transition students from graphical programming to more powerful written code languages. His low cost and smarts are perfectly suited to STEM education and learning workshops. He's also a perfect introduction for grownups interested in tinkering with robotics that don't know where to begin.The Scratch programming environment has become a popular way to introduce kids to basic programming concepts. The graphical interface is easy and inviting. Eventually students need to move on to writing actual code. We designed Wink to be the next logical step - allowing students and grownups to learn actual written code with small simple steps while having fun along the way.The Wink project was born out of collaboration with educators who were looking for a robot platform to bridge the simplicity of graphical style programming to ""real world"" programming languages like Java, Python, C, and C++. Wink is a great solution. He is low cost, fun to play with, and well suited to teach the basics of written code in an engaging way.The Wink project includes a curriculum that is free and open. The curriculum is designed to be easily adopted at home and by workshops and school programs. It includes easy to introduce lessons guided by videos.This low cost robot allows students to program common robotic tasks such as:The robots are small and playful and require minimal storage space between instruction sessions. We carefully considered the parts and sensors on Wink to enable students to embody the common entry level robotics concepts like line following, light seeking, and barrier detection. Wink will inspire students to experiment on their own by writing more involved behaviors.One of the reasons graphical programming like Scratch is so great is that it's not intimidating. Putting graphical puzzle pieces together that do something is an easy concept to understand.We've taken a similar approach introducing written code. Students will write programs that are no more intimidating than the puzzle pieces they are used to. We have written functions that work similar to those in Scratch that are super easy to understand and use. While playing with the Wink robot, students are learning the foundation of the powerful C programming language which is widely used to control the microprocessors used in all manner of robotics, embedded systems, automation, and the growing Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. By backing this project you can help us finish the rest of our lesson plans. We've written several already and we would like to complete a series of about 20 lessons beginning with the super basics and moving through more advanced core programming concepts.1) We will be able to finish the 20 or so written lessons. These lessons will be free and open source and published as PDF documents.2) We will be able to film the guide videos for the lessons, which will allow educators who may have no programming experience of their own to host student sessions with the Wink robot. Videos will be posted to an online playlist where they can be freely viewed at any time.3) We will be able to purchase the parts to build future stock of Wink robots in larger quantity and at lower cost. This will allow us to offer Wink to end users and educators at low cost.We've published the rough draft of the first four lessons below so you can get a feel for the overall flow and style of the additional upcoming lessons. As lessons are written, we'll share them with any educators requesting copies along the way and ask for feedback. Final lessons will incorporate this feedback so they are all clear and effective.Wink is based on the popular Arduino UNO hardware board. It is programmed using the Arduino development environment which is free and open source.Based on Arduino: Wink is based on the Arduino UNO.  He has the same Atmel ATMega328p microprocessor. This simple 8-bit processor is perfect for learning the basics. Code is written using the Arduino IDE which is free and open source.Works on Most Computers: The Arduino development environment runs on Windows, Mac, and most Linux computers.Fast Motors: Wink's motors are FAST. At full speed he can zoom across a floor or table in the wink of an eye. Each motor can be independently driven forward or backward and at any variable speed.RGB Eyes: Wink's eyes can be made any color you can think of and controlled individually to give your Wink a personality. Eye brightness can also be carefully controlled.Ambient Light Sensors: Three light sensors on the top side can measure light from directly ahead, as well as 45 degrees to either side. The sensors enable light seeking and behaviors activated by lights.Barrier Headlight: An infrared barrier headlight is tucked under Wink's nose. This can be used together with the ambient light sensors to detect obstacles several inches in front of the robot.Line and Edge Sensors: An array of four bottom sensors along Wink's front bottom allow for high speed line following as well as edge detection.Button: You will learn how to read the user button in your code and change how Wink reacts to it.Sound: A piezo sound element allows simple tone chirps for audio feedback and creating alarm behaviors. Battery: An onboard rechargeable 240 mAh LiPo battery provides hours of run time.Charging: A complete automatic charging solution is provided right onboard. Simply plug Wink into the programming adapter and he automatically charges and stops charging when full. A charge in progress LED tells you when he's completely charged.Our previous Kickstarter for Ringo ran a bit over schedule. This was due to a few delays in custom parts, as well as the fact that we had way more backers than we'd ever expected.Because the Wink robot uses the same parts as Ringo (and we have plenty of those parts in stock in our shop), we don't expect any delays from availability. The only real lead time item we need to order is our circuit boards. We're using the same factory we have ordered from many times with reliable on time service.To get ahead of the time curve, we will order the Wink circuit boards before the Kickstarter is even complete. Funds from Kickstarter don't arrive until two weeks following the campaign, but we can easily accommodate making at least 200 units without these funds.For this reason we are as sure as we can be that we are able to manufacture and deliver at least 200 Wink units before Christmas 2015. Delivery to USA backers before Christmas is very likely unless something really bad happens. Shipping time to international backers can vary by country, but international backers in the first 200 should still receive their Wink units around or shortly following Christmas.Depending on how many backer units we need to make, additional units will ship throughout December and going into January.Wink and Ringo are manufactured in our own family owned shop located near Portland Oregon. Kevin spends his days thinking up and designing fun stuff. Nona handles shipping and admin, and Juston is the master of the assembly machines. He can solder anything. Our two awesome kiddos Parker and Hailey hang out around the shop once in a while entertaining us all. They are responsible for final approval of all of Dad's designs.

91," Sweep is a scanning LiDAR sensor designed to bring powerful 360 degree sensing capabilities to everyone for an affordable price.IEEE Spectrum | Hizook | Gizmag | DIY Drones | Atmel | RoboHub | Techable | ForbotWe wanted a scanning LiDAR for our projects and couldn’t findanything that was powerful enough and easy to use for a price we could afford. Comparable sensors are $1000 and up, so we set out to develop one ourselves. 

We’re raising money on Kickstarter to manufacture Sweep so we can get them into the hands of makers, roboticists, drone enthusiasts and students. We’re really excited about making scanning LiDAR available to everyone!Use Sweep for sense and avoid as well as navigation mapping. We'll provide all the tools needed to start developing more autonomy into your drone.  ""At Dispatch, we are very excited by Sweep. LiDAR is a very powerful sensing modality and low-cost LiDAR will have significant impact as we develop and grow our autonomous vehicle fleet.""

Uriah Baalke

Dispatch Robotics""The Sweep is a great fit for high school robotics. It is easy to setup and use, robust, and is at an incredible price point. Students can quickly explore mapping and navigation problems with little prior experience. Best yet, the Sweep is virtually student-proof – it can survive a high school lab environment."" 
 Charles Williams Mentor, Cupertino High School RoboticsCombining technology and art can produce really fun and interesting pieces. Use Sweep to detect where someone is or activate different components to make your next art project interactive!Have you ever wanted to quickly get the dimensions of a room? Measuring tapes are a hassle! Use Sweep to quickly grab a room's dimensions in a couple seconds. Security / People TrackingSweep can be used to create a ""virtual curtain"", meaning it will sense anything that interrupts a particular area. Use it to detect when someone walks through a doorway or tries to touch something they shouldn't! You can also use Sweep to track people moving within a space. Perhaps you want to have your smart lights switch off when you leave a room and before you enter another.Whatever you can imagine!Sweep is already useful for several applications, but there are so many more that haven't been discovered yet and we're super excited to see what you come up with! What makes Sweep different?Sweep utilizes a sensing technique that differs from most other LiDAR on the market, which allows us to use lower power components to perform long range measurements. This lowers the cost of the components, but requires more time per measurement. Sweep is the first commercial scanning LiDAR that utilizes this technology.Sweep is designed to be modular! As we continue to improve the capabilities of the sensor module, we'll be able to offer upgrades without the need to replace the entire scanner. 
Sweep
    by scanse
    on Sketchfab
SpecificationsThe scanning capabilities of the Sweep allow you to adjust the rotation speed on the fly so you can slow it down for more detail, or speed it up for fast reaction times.  Sweep uses a laser that has been tested to be eye safe (even if you decide to stare at it straight on - not advised).  It operates in the infrared spectrum which is invisible to the human eye.Communicating with Sweep is really simple! We're including our small adapter for those who want to connect to any computer using USB. If you want to connect Sweep to lower level controllers, just hook it up directly to UART. We designed Sweep to be very small and light! It fits right in the palm of your hand and weighs a tad less than most smart phones today. Sweep is also really quiet, something you may have never thought about until you've used one that makes annoying sounds as it spins. You won't be hearing this scanner. For more detailed info checkout the datasheet here:What each Sweep Scanner includesScanse VisualizerOur visualizer allows you to view the sensor data (like this room with someone walking around above), record and playback data, change settings, and update the firmware. It will be available on Linux, Windows, and OS X. ROS SupportWe’ve already developed a ROS driver for Sweep as well as an example publisher node to start using Sweep in ROS right away. Here is an example ROS bag file recorded from the hallway scene in our video.SDK:
python, javascript, C/C++Using Sweep in your own project starts with the SDK. We're developing drivers for several major languages and will be creating example projects for platforms like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and more. Example Projects / DriversThese software projects and drivers are already in development and will be released as soon as they are complete.Pixhawk autopilot driver: This driver will make available the angle and distance for the centroid of nearest object bodies within range. This uses a special mode with Sweep and does not require additional processing by the flight controller.National Instruments roboRIO driver: This driver will provide the complete scan data on each complete rotation which can then be used to guide a robot.Movement Tracker: This example application for the Raspberry Pi will allow you to track moving bodies within a space. Set threshold areas to activate or deactivate when entering or leaving them. Trigger an IFTTT recipe using the Maker Channel to do things like turn lights or security systems on/off.Room Dimensions: This example application for the Raspberry Pi will output room measurements with centimeter accuracy.Kickstarter FundingWe have three main goals for this kickstarter project:We are committed to delivering a high quality product. We have a beta tester community that has been giving valuable feedback on our development units. Once we get production units from our contract manufacturer, we will go through another round of development tests before shipping to our customers.  We have a long standing relationship with our PCB manufacturer that has produced quality boards from the beginning and will continue to produce our boards for production.The majority of our product will be made from high strength injection molded plastic. We have extensive experience designing injection molded components, and will be using a mold house that has produced high quality parts for us in the past.TimelineRewardsTeam Our team has diverse engineering and product design backgrounds. We've worked on projects ranging from robotic chassis design to space grade LiDAR systems at companies like iRobot, ASC, and ATK.With more than a decade of experience taking products to market, we are confident we have what it takes to make this project successful.We're constantly thinking of ways to improve and enhance the capabilities of Sweep. We will be collaborating with the community to develop add-on kits for a wide range of applications. We'll be releasing all the necessary design files, part lists, and software examples if applicable for these kits and future ones. This is a spherical scan we did of a backyard with the kit belowSpherical Scanning is really the next step. We've designed a mounting bracket for Robotis Dynamixel servos that will rotate the Sweep for spherical scans. We'll be sharing the design files and software for this shortly after the campaign. We are not providing any of the components of this kit as part of the campaign.Sweep is designed to work well outdoors, but has not yet been hardened against the elements. If you want to use Sweep in dusty or wet environments, you're going to need some protection. We are developing a special enclosure that will allow Sweep to operate in much rougher conditions.

I will be using SWEEP in a project which is getting delayed due to delayed shipment.. please update the shipping dates at the earliest.~Please update me on shipping date?. When I should expect my reward to be shipped??~I'm moving, how do I update my address with you?~Hey, I'm moving and I have no idea where my SCANSE is in transit. Can someone contact me in DMs and help me resolve! Thanks yall!~@creator: Can you confirm whether future international shipping will also have the customs charges unpaid?If I need to keep €90 on hand to just accept the delivery I'd like to know in advance please.~If you guys are just tossing out those defective units, I would be willing to accept one with the knowledge of the defect, waiving any right to return, etc if there would have been one. I.E. saving you guys money and ensuring I get to play with it.~Got mine today, but 80€ customs + 10€ UPS fee seems a little high for an early bird pledge of 229$~@scanse I'm really excited for this product, however we were hoping to use it for a FIRST competition, is it possible to receive it earlier as mentioned in the update?~As @D Larsen asked, do you have any rough shipment schedule?Then we can stop wondering and asking.For example,No. 1 - No.50            DAY ANo. 51 - No.100       DAY BNo.101- No.200       DAY C......~This is the moment of maximum anticipation as we see others receive their units and wonder when ours will arrive.  Do you have any update on how many have shipped?~Received my sweep today! Excellent quality, far exceeds my expectations. Involved in another project at the moment, complete home renovation. So it will be a few weeks before I be able to test it out and a few more before I can starting integrating into a project I planned. But I am stoked at how nice the sweep looks can't wait to start using it and ordering more.~Wouldn't it be better to just find some durable labels than wait for those special stickers? Also as backer 500 when should I expect the lidar?~Is it possible to just include the stickers in the box? I am capable of putting on the sticker if it means I will get my device several weeks earlier.~a couple of weeks delay due to some stickers? :(~Any shipping updates?~Comdolences to the family.   Thanks for quick response.  Looking forward to reviving my package.  :)~Were you able to start shipping on the 19th?  Hoping to get mine soon!~I realize now my last comment was very down sounding, but was meant as a light-hearted joke. Look forward to the new toys.~*Taps heals together. Please don't be another Skully. Please don't be another Skully. Please don't be another Skully.* Sorry, been burned a couple times. I'm sure everything is great. Last email just reminded me of the Skully delays. I hope you guys aren't spending thousands a night at strip clubs. Anyways, looks good. Please work it out.~Nice software and pretty GUI! It would be great to have LAS/LAZ export, very useful for people who work in LiDAR processing.~I had a look at the sweep visualizer. It's looking good and intuitive! What I didn't find and would be important for my specific use is the ability to export point clouds. Will that be possible? I'm planning on using it in the field of architecture for site surveys so I would like to import the point clouds into cad.~have you send my device ?~Your campaign promised the instructions for the spherical scanning base for the Sweep, but I can not find them or a link to them on any of the sites. Could you please post the link so that we can begin to work on that in anticipation of delivery. Thank you!~Any T-Shirts left ? :)~What is the current shipping status for us backers?~I plan on purchasing more of these. Will your price be going up on your website after preorders?

We knew how a lot of makers would love to play around with RaspberryPi, but installing the ROS and Linux is too complicated. And making your own robots requires a lot of welding, which also takes a lot of time and effort. We thought it would be great if we can come up with something that can easily make your robot building dream come true, or even better, turn your RaspberryPi into a robot, and at the same time easily because we pre-installed the Linux and ROS and we made the parts magnetic so no more welding. So that is how CrazyPi came into being, it will be your first choice when it comes to robot building. We want to give out our special thanks to AAC & ACT LAB, for providing us the place and equipment we need to carry out this project. We want to thank uArm for the advice and the cooperation, which has made CrazyPi even better. Thanks Shenzhenware for featuring CrazyPi. Most importantly, we want to thank our backers for bringing this project to life, none of these will be possible without your love and support.

I'm a backer in Hong Kong and still got nothing, even a tracking number. You guys are lucky to at least got a tracking number, just be patient.~Hi: The tracking website indicates (apparently) that only the shipping label has been created - nothing has shipped yet, with no status update in 6 days!! Please see the pasted shipping information below, taken off the tracking website. Why is the CrazyPi having so much difficulty shipping complete sets, or shipping at all, when so many other Kickstarter Teams do so successfully? These are questions you should be asking yourselves, and communicating what you intend to do to correct it to your Backers!~@CrazyPiOkay, I read your comment below. So it is partial shipment.(I guess it's important you should put it in the update, rather than comments)Well, where is the rest of the tracking # then? I'm scratching my head now.~@CrazyPiYou send me the tracking number two weeks ago. I received the package today. It only contains the LIDAR part.I pledge for the Advance Kit.Your message not saying anything about sending part by part.If you did so, please confirm ASAP.  Otherwise, there's some mistake here.Thanks.~I am backer#123, I have confirmed my contact details.  Please help check and confirm the details of the delivery please! ~@crazypi I am glad to hear that some friend here receive the actual product. I still can’t receive any MSG, I’m afraid that is the problem of the international format of the phone no. Would you consider to send the tracking information by mail. Thank you very much.~Aloha @CrazyPi thanks.~Are we expecting multiple partial deliveries?  I received roughly the same as @Lee Guo Wei today.~Aloha  Lee Guo Wei. Thanks for letting us know that you received a package. If you go to the crazyou.com web site and click on docs, it's there but, still in Chinese. I did setup my account at crazyou.com and when they sent me the message to confirm, it was in Chinese. Thanks to Google translate I was able to get the Chinese translated to English.~I've actually had given up hope of getting anything. but today a huge parcel arrived and in it the lidar, camera and motherboard and the uarm!!! though an instruction manual would be helpful too. hopefully that will be included with the remaining items to be delivered.~Aloha Clay, use this https://www.17track.net/zh-cn and the tracking number they sent you.~The tracking number you sent in the e-mail is not a valid number, according to China Post EUB. What is the correct tracking number for my shipment? When will it arrive?~Good things come to those of us with patience. I can not wait to get my package and start developing my robot.Thank you CrazyPi !     You rock!!!~Hello, I downloaded the app but cannot log in. I went to your website to create an account but I get an error message about the formatting of my phone number. Also, it's a bit tricky to work with your website since some things are still in Chinese.~You seem to missed the 10 day update window for shipping?  Any news is appreciated....~Hi, I’m backer #8. May I know the status? Thanks.~I am backer#123, please advise when I am going to receive the package! ~Thanks for the tracking and shipping info!!! This will probably reach you all soon.~Aloha CrazyPi staff. It is now 10 days after your last post, is there any update on shipping? You also said you were publishing an English version of the app, I've looked in github and Google play store and I can't find an updated app. I did notice an app in Google play store, but it has Chinese on the app's opening page and I did see the software commit to lidar on github. Thanks, hope to hear an update soon.~Thank you for the short info! I'm looking forward to playing with the CrazyPi!~Any update about the shipment????~Now Jan 20 and still no shipping or updates.~Aloha CrazyPi staff, it is disheartening that there has been no communication for almost 3 weeks.  Are you shipping out the product or just taking the backers for a ride?~Who is the shipping agent? I have not received any email about this or to confirm my shipping address.~when is the shipping?~Aloha CrazyPi staff, do you know if your shipping agent has shipped or will be shipping our rewards by the end of January? Thanks.~Happy New year!If you possible, please share us some pictures or video about it.I'd like to know current status.~Aloha CrazyPi staff, as of this writing, it is 4 days since confirming my personal information at Kickstarter. How long do you think it will take to confirm your backer's personal information and send our rewards? Also, when do you expect an English google play and iOS store apps to be ready?~Thanks for the update. Merry Christmas to CrazyPi staff and my fellow backers.~Hey CrazyPi staff, an update is the least your backers deserve for Christmas, or do you anticipate kits arriving in the next 48 hours or so?~Aloha CrazyPi staff, any update on the battery box and shipments? It's after December 10. Thanks!~Is there any further updates on status of shipments?~I just submitted my survey. It's getting exciting, can't wait to get my kit from CrazyPi. Thanks CrazyPi.~Just received my survey~I think it is difficult to send package by 25th.For Christmas, airport is crowded with gift,  so it takes many times to go through the customs formalities.~Hi, can you make survey this month?~Aloha crazy pi staff, will the rewards be shipped by Christmas or are we all getting Scrooged?~@CrazyPi It's already middle of November, can you please send out the survey or questionnaire for collection of backer postal address and confirm the rewards of individual backer. Personally, I don't mind delay in delivering rewards but effective communication from project creator should be a prerequisite for a successful project.~Are you Crazy pi?~When do you expect shipping to the United States will begin?~@Kenneth Lam OK, thanks for the clarification.  I thought they'd get the address information from Kickstarter as has happened with other projects I've backed.  But, as long as they start delivering product, I'll standby for the time being.~@Michael Anderson What the survey CrazyPi talking about is to collect backer address for rewards delivery, I've commented on 16 Oct to ask about this. It's because without such information how can they deliver the rewards to backers. However, their lack of communication still bugs me, I'll wait another week, if still no updates, I may contact my CC to file a dispute.~OK, thanks Taka KA for posting the update.  But, I'm having a hard time interpreting their message.  What the heck is an ""address investigation mail""?  And, what survey?  They're ""actively research and develop our products""?   I thought the board layout was done and going to fab.  This sounds like they still don't even have a design yet.  This is sounding more and more like we've lost our money. :-(~",0.0,"HK$ 200,000",CrazyPi - The True Robot Kit For DIY Robot Lovers by CrazyPi — Kickstarter
93,"  The LittleArm was a weekend project that has grown into a full-time project and business. This campaign is to get the ball rolling.I wanted a robot arm. But even the kits are expensive, for what they deliver. So one weekend I grabbed a few high strength microservos and went to work designing the parts to have printed.At the end of the weekend I had a couple of different versions of the robot. I took it to work and everyone loved to play with it and I soon had a couple of people ask me to print them one. Later, I was doing some demonstrations for STEM teachers. They also loved the idea, and they asked me to make them some for their classes. So I decided to turn my little maker project into an actual product at Slant Robotics.This campaign is to raise funds for building software and tutorials on using the arm and to purchase several 3-D printers and other supplies in order to produce the arms in greater quantities. The LittleArm is a completely open source project. I made it 3-D printed so that anyone can download the parts and start using it. It also ensures that the arm can be rapidly changed and developed for different applications, without being constrained by molds.The arm is controlled entirely by an Arduino Uno. The Uno provides a decent amount of support and is very versatile. These qualities allow almost anyone to start programming the arm and add other features like sensors.Arduino is also supported on platforms such as Blockly,  so beginners can write programs graphically.The arm is designed to have a modular gripper. While there is a servo to actuate a gripper I have also designed several rigid end-effectors for different tasks.If you want to use the GUI or create some other complex program, you need more than the Arduino. All other software, is entirely based in Python. Python is a simple language to learn and has a large amount of support.Most of the foundational programs have been created. Kinematics are done. We have a basic GUI. And best of all we have a ""record"" function so you can train the robot to perform a task and then watch it go.That is the start, but honestly the number of programs that can be created for an arm like this is big.We could set-up a webcam and add vision. We could have some basic sensors so that it follows a laser pointer. We could make it play with a ball. (Oh wait, we did that)But in order to create all of those programs we need a little money and a bit of help. We would love it if anyone who is interested in the project shares their code with us on our website.We have already created a basic website to support the arm. It started as a project blog, so it is a bit rough. But we are working on getting it upgraded.In the future the website will contain all resources needed to build, work with, and teach with the LittleArm.STEMSo many of the programming kits out there are just too complicated and quickly become boring. How many times does it take to make a robot follow a line before the kids decide the idea is stupid? Plus many of those ""build"" kits just have a bunch of pieces waiting to be lost.This arm is a great kit that doesn't have many pieces to lose, can take a kid through every part of engineering, from design to programming, and always has something else to add.Imagine a class project where kids have to create an assembly line with their robot arms. Or they create a small group of synchronized dancing robots. Maybe they train the robot to feed the science class lizard. While this arm is simple it can do a ton of stuff.HobbyThere are a lot of hobby arms out there. But they are all expensive, and they are really not very helpful because they depend on a 'community' to make it interesting. This arm is so basic that anyone with a any kind of experience can easily create programs from scratch. And while we like and want a community, it is not a necessity to use this arm.ResearchYes, that is what was just said. This arm can be used for a number of different research purposes. In fact I am working on a small project in deep learning right now with the arm. It is a whole lot easier to test software on this arm than on a large industrial robot. And since deep learning requires data, it is a lot cheaper to get 100 of these arms to provide data than a single industrial arm.But that is all nerd stuff. No one really cares about that.Actual Home UseHave you ever forgotten to feed the fish. This arm could be programmed to do it. Maybe someone at the table needs a mint. This arm could broach the subject.  Maybe it could scratch your cat's belly. Maybe it could put the sugar in your coffee. Maybe you need a Rube Goldberg method of turning on a light.We don't expect anyone to make these an official part of their home.

Must be a slow boat from China since they also say it will take a month for them to get it.  Then a few weeks till we get it.  And they cannot give us an update until they receive shipment.  Why--don't they already know what is being shipped.  Tim is correct.  Probably 3 more months at the earliest.   The fact that they refuse to give us an update is troubling to say the least.~Hello? Hello? What is the latest progress? Are we seeing the product as promised?~Taking bets now that the update will be at least a 3 month delay.~Hello? Hello?What is the latest progress?

We all want to know!~Where is the massive update promise back in April?~@robotbase so by end of June all units should be received by backers?~So when does that mean it would arrive on our doorsteps?~Robot Base, I know you say you are doing everything you can to deliver a fantastic product but when? I'm sorry but over 2 years is just nuts! It's time for a full refund if you can't deliver the promised product within a set time now. We are all losing our patiences.~When is it going to be delivered?~Will Maya be capable of performing the functions of Echo and Alexa? graham mirabito brings up a good point~Is it time for a refund???~It is too late Amazon and Google are eating this market with their own AI so unfortunately Maya is DOA whenever​ that is. Time for a refund robotbase.~When will it arrive on my doorstep?~I have a great investment opportunity for anyone interested! ~Two months in a shipping container from end of April they say then send on to us in June? That better be the case because I'm not waiting another month!~ANOTHER DELAY.  IT SEEMS EVERY MONTH IS ANOTHER DELAY-THIS IS THE MOST RECENT EMAIL I RECEIVEDOur developers have notified us that the robots will be ready April 30 and then they will be shipped to us from overseas we are scheduled to start shipping them out the end of May beginning June but we will be sending out a mass email with an exact shipping date.~",0.0,"$50,000",Personal Robot by Robotbase — Kickstarter
95,"   Created by NYU robotics professor Rudi Cossovich and ex-Google engineer Sean Purser-Haskell, Plobot is a fun, educational robot that teaches young learners coding concepts without all the messy syntax – and without any need for computer screens. They’ll learn about algorithms, loops, conditionals, and more, all while having a blast with their favorite new toy!        Plobot helps kids discover coding concepts through physical play. No screens, all fun!Easily tell Plobot what to do - just tap the Command Cards to program algorithms, loops, conditionals, and more!      Plobot started from the idea that kids learn best from physical play.With Plobot, we wanted to answer a crucial question: how do we get kids excited to learn about something as abstract as programming? We aimed to create a fun, effortless introduction to coding that promotes productive playtime away from computer screens. That led to Plobot - a happy little robot that can move, sing, dance, and entertain with a few simple commands.  Command cards are at the core of the Plobot experience, making every interaction tactile and hands-on.  Each Command Card represents a block of code. Tap or swipe them on Plobot’s head to string them together and create a ‘program’ the robot follows - with the ""play"" card as an execute function. The base set lays the building blocks for controlling Plobot, while our expansion sets allow the robot to grow with your child’s abilities, creating countless possible combinations!  There are two distinct types of cards in our base set: Function cards, and Motion cards.           Our expansion sets introduce additional entertaining functions and more advanced coding sequences.   Color cards can be combined to make Plobot glow all the colors of the rainbow!      Modifiers change the effects of other Command Cards, and Sensor cards tell Plobot to wait until it senses an object to carry out the next action. These cards act like conditionals in a programming language.     Plobot's stations act like objective markers for various programming lessons, and help Plobot tell a story. For example, you could have Plobot navigate a path from the Home Station to the Ice Cream Shop Station, listen for permission to get an ice cream, then dance to celebrate when it gets one!        Plobot is designed to foster a spirit of creativity in kids, giving them freedom to create and setting them up to be the makers of tomorrow.   With up to 50 possible steps in one sequence, dozens of cards and more expansions on the way, the possibilities with Plobot are truly endless. Plobot empowers your child to embrace the future and become a maker of technology, not just a consumer.     Plobot is made of easily washable plastic, and our expansion sets even come with stickers to make every robot unique. Kids can mold new shapes with clay, draw on it with pen, or even build crazy formations on its back with Duplo building blocks. Kids love turning Plobot into their own personal spaceship!  Starting at a young age is the best way to prepare children for careers in STEM and computer science, and Plobot is the perfect tool.   Computational thinking is something most of us use every day to solve all kinds of problems, without even realizing it. It’s all about breaking down complex tasks into a logical sequence of steps to reach an objective. Plobot teaches kids that there are no right and wrong answers when learning code; by breaking down each task into a sequence of steps, they exercise problem solving and creative thinking abilities, while picking up core coding concepts.   Plobot is designed to strengthen problem solving and logical reasoning skills, giving your children a head start in programming concepts in an exciting, intuitive way. Imagine the possibilities they’ll unlock as they gain confidence in their mastery of STEM learning and robotics, putting them one step ahead of the curve in school and in life.  Plobot helps parents and teachers to make playtime both productive and fun for kids everywhere.We designed a robot that combined decades of education research with core programming concepts. We’ve tested it over many workshops with hundreds of kids all over the world. The one thing our workshops had in common? Everyone loved Plobot!    We used our experiences in these workshops to design a custom online teaching guide, with a curriculum centered around Plobot’s abilities. It’s downloadable through your own unique link, and will use our Command Cards and Stations to help you build a lesson plan and teach kids to code. The curriculum fosters creativity, grows with your child’s progress, and takes them on countless adventures with their friend Plobot!  Parents, teachers, and kids everywhere love Plobot! We asked some parents and leading professors in the STEM field to share what they thought about our little robot invention. Check out their responses below.                Coming in from Shanghai, Plobot sprung forth from our deep passion for education and the belief that robotics can be the answer. While there has been a lot of focus on teaching programming to children through iPads and computers, Plobot takes a new approach marked by physical programming, with no screens. We've built an educational platform based on different Open Source technologies that can be easily adopted by parents or teachers.
 In the middle of 2015, Plobot was accepted into the Make in LA hardware accelerator, receiving huge support and mentorship from the program. We also launched workshops with parents as part of an agreement with Toys R` Us in their ""Explorium"" center.
   Our team is composed of makers, teachers, toy designers, and illustrators. Plobot's inventor and CEO Rodolfo Cossovich has been tinkering with robotics for years, successfully launching open-source robot platform Multiplo on Kickstarter back in 2012. He currently teaches robotics and animatronics at NYU's Shanghai campus and enjoys playing with his newborn daughter Maxima. Our CTO Sean Purser-Haskell used to work at Google's Mountain View headquarters and now spends most of his time at the local hackerspace XinCheJian - experimenting with ultrasound, high voltage and superconductors. Scott Si is a product manager who is passionate about edtech, leading all marketing and business development efforts as the driving force behind this crowdfunding project.

But the arm issue can't be that complex. I'm sure a solid week spent on that issue will lead to a fix.~HelloHow can I change my shipping address?~Hi--you might consider for the ones that aren't fitting with duplos to have an adaptor piece? that's what littlebits have--a brick adaptor that gets littlebits to fit with legos.~So Plobot will not have moving arms and you don't want to fix that.Now you say that lego bricks won't fit on Plobot and you won't fix that too - instead we receive some clay? Wow.~No word in this update about the arms. You know, if you made these in Taiwan instead of China, they'd be in the stores already.~@ Creator, you mentioned that "" In November we have shipped about a dozen units to the backers in closer proximity to our production facility near Shanghai..."", I am in Hong Kong but have received nothing up to-date.It has been more than a half-year delay, please fix the shipping time or I'd like to have my money back.~At this point you should really start keeping a journal and publish key things at least once a month.~How is the fix for the moving arms coming along?~You said you were going to start shipping in January. There are 6 days left in January. Have you started shipping? Should we expect a notification in the next 6 days?~I want a refund.Please, tell me how to do it.~I want moving arms! x[~Please fix the arm servo issue. The original representation of the Plobot featured movable arms. I always assumed that the arm movements were programmable too.  Programmable or not, we want moving arms.~Please rest assured us.For example, I want to see a movie in which the product actually operates.Or, I would like to see photos created in large quantities.~What does that mean that the arm will be locked into the body instead of servo motors? No more arm movement?I would have taken another delay for proper working arms :(~""will begin shipping units to backers in mid November."" That was from your update in OCTOBER. It is now December. This project is approaching the 1 year mark of being delayed. Will we be getting it before Christmas? Maybe next Christmas? MORE UPDATES.~Dear Plobot team,~Any news on shipping?It would be great to have our plobots in time for christmas.~Dear Plobot team. Can we expect the plobot for christmas? Im located in switzerland so please count in the long shipping distance and that the shipping company has a lot of work with christmas time. It would be super when a can give it this year to my children. Best regards~Update Please �~It’s almost thanksgiving and I haven’t received any kind of shipping notification. I have tried to be very patient. I understand that production can get delayed. But I feel like this is getting a little ridiculous.Please provide an update with a realistic date of when this will actually ship. I bought this for my niece and I would really like to be able to give it to her for Christmas.~Does the shipping start already this week? In which order will they be shipped?~Hello guys. Any news?I think you should keep us updated with more than one update per month since you're pretty late on the initial schedule.Also the facebook and twitter profiles seem to be abandoned.~I am hoping that this project will not become pearshaped, waited almost a year now and there are so many alike products on the market now too~Hi, update on planning please :)~What's going on?  I filled out the survey a while ago....~It doesn't look like I have mine either. Eager to get mine to try with a friend's child.~Hello, it looks like I never received the survey. I am one of the early backers, when am I going to receive my Plobot?~Super cool update! I'm excited! :)~Dear plobot team. I didnt get my plobot till now. I just wondering is it still on the way?

FLX.ARM is the tool every design, engineering, and manufacturing professional needs for their office, lab, studio, or production space.  We have engineered and manufactured every component on the FLX.ARM to enable it to be the most precise, low-cost, and extensible platform on the market.
The FLX.ARM.S16.Z8 is a SCARA robot.  SCARA stands for Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm.  This simply means the robot arm moves along the X-Y plane and uses an additional actuator to move along the Z-Axis.  By restricting movement to the X-Y plane the robot arm is able to maintain rigidity in the Z-Axis without requiring the joints to overcome gravity.With a reach of 16"" [406.4 mm] in the X-Y plane and 8"" [203.2 mm] of Z travel the FLX.ARM.S16.Z8 has a large configurable workspace.Low-cost precision robotic arms can cost on average from $10k - $40k.  Much of the cost is in the development and manufacturing of the robotic joints.  We have reduced the cost of manufacturing and assembling the robotic joint by using off-the-shelf components for actuation and by automating the manufacturing and calibration processes.Many open-loop motion control platforms depend on stepper motors to provide precise motion.  No sensor or feedback system communicates the current physical position to the motion control software.  The accuracy specification for an open-loop motion control platform is most likely based on a calculation and not the real-world physical accuracy of the machine.  This calculation is based on the stepper motors ability to micro-step and the pitch of the timing belt or lead screw.  Micro-stepping a stepper motor increases resolution but dramatically reduces per step torque.  As an example, a 1/16th micro-step reduces torque to less than 10% of full-step torque.  As the rotational velocity of the motor increases the torque is further reduced.  This reduction in torque can cause the stepper motor to stall if any non-ideal motion occurs.  A stall results in lost motion and precision.  Any lost motion in an open-loop system will accumulate.  A closed-loop system is able to dynamically consume the lost motion.    FLX.ARM is a closed-loop motion control platform with integrated ultra-high resolution optical encoders for feedback.  The encoders are coupled directly to the output of each joint resulting in the ability to dynamically consume lost motion and dampen positional overshoot/undershoot.Absolute positioning allows the FLX.ARM to always knows its position on the X-Y plane.  It does not require homing on power-up.  When you command FLX.ARM to a given position it will go repeatably to that position within 0.001"" [0.025mm].FLX.ARM is precision machined from 6061-T6 billet aluminum.  Each joint is preloaded with precision bearings capable of dynamically loading over 5000 lb of force.  Unlike traditional linear motion platforms, FLX.ARM does not use timing belts that require tensioning or shafts that require alignment.Human-machine collaboration is essential, but so is machine-machine collaboration.  The collaborative nature of a robotic arm is what differentiates it from all other machine platforms.  Collaboration enables a robotic arm to change tools and load parts on a CNC mill or lathe and provides scalability with 3D printing, pick and place, and assembly operations.  FLX.ARM is able to collaborate and distribute the workload of a single task.Modular toolheads allow the FLX.ARM to be extensible.  An extensible machine platform can be used for more than one task.  The following toolheads are currently available with additional toolheads in development.  The 3D printer toolhead integrates the all metal E3D hot end with our bowden filament drive.  We chose the E3D hot end due its ability to consistently print a wide-range of materials.Materials include:We have included a thermocouple to increase the maximum operating temperature of the hot end.  An integrated fan maintains the thermal characteristics of the hot end.  An additional fan is provided and may be mounted to the accessory port of the toolhead to provide active cooling of the 3D printed part.  A 0.4 mm nozzle is included.  The 3D printer toolhead is capable of printing at a 100 micron layer height.The pick and place toolhead integrates a rotary joint, solenoid valve, and your choice of a venturi vacuum pump or micro-electric vacuum pump.  A precision production quality SMT pick and place head is included with nozzles for most SMT parts down to the 0402 size.  Nozzles for 0201 parts will be available for purchase at the time of shipment.  Any vacuum cup with a 10-32 thread may be mounted directly to the toolhead.We are in the process of developing accessories for the pick and place toolhead including a vision system and solder paste dispenser.The light-duty milling toolhead provides a precision mount for the Proxxon IBS/E rotary tool.  The Proxxon IBS/E is capable of 5000 - 20000 rpm and is powered from 115 VAC.  The Proxxon IBS/E is not included but is readily available in most parts of the world.  FLX.ARM is able to mill a variety of materials.Materials include:The probing toolhead includes a 3D probe and 2"" probe tip.  The combination of the 3D probe and FLX.ARM's absolute positioning provides a precision versatile measuring apparatus.  In addition, the probe may be used to find edges on a workpiece.It can be difficult to level the build platforms for the large workspace FLX.ARM provides.  Some operations are able to compensate for a skewed build surface, but it is best to start with a level build platform.  We have developed leveling mounts for our build plates that are adjustable and positioned by FLX.ARM.  We custom machine precision ground mic6 cast aluminum plate to fit 90 degree sections of the workspace.  Each 90 degree build plate section includes 4 leveling mounts. We have spent over 4 years developing FLX.IDE.  We built a unique client-server architecture to enable a rich platform independent client and high-peformance server processing.  Our client only requires a WebGL enabled browser.  With the release of iOS 8 all major operating systems support WebGL.Features include:Import formats include:FLX.CTL is our hardware interface for machine control and is comprised of an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller with an integrated FPU, floating point unit, and an FPGA.  The FPGA provides real-time parallel processing of I/O while the ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller executes commands and  provides efficient network communication over ethernet.  FLX.CTL enables FLX.ARM, CNC machines, and automation equipment to be interfaced with FLX.IDE.Features include:We have spent years developing our core technologies.  We now need an active passionate community to provide us feedback.  With your support we can hire additional help and scale our production capabilities.  Thank you for taking the time to learn about Flux Integration and our mission to enable seamless design and manufacturing.Music: Deep Haze Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)SplatBag 3D Model: Ben Malouf",Flux Integration LLC,"$82,905",Unstated,"Low-cost precision robotic arm for 3D printing, light-duty milling, and electronics assembly.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,96 ," Might want to use an optical fiber instead:  http://www.industrial-lasers.com/articles/2013/11/fiber-versus-co2-laser-cutting.html~Seems like it would be really difficult to keep the laser in a fixed position, as the head moves how would the laser maintain focus and position?  Most of the time designs with fixed lasers are on more of a core X/Y where mirrors can be used.  Not sure how/if that works on an arm design like the FLX.ARM~btw both are kind of big so ive got a few galvanometers.  Im looking at making the head universal so you just setup any laser on the bench in a jig and align it then focus the beam on the head as opposed the installing the whole laser in the head.  I scarfed the parts from a 10 watt etching laser we had at work and had the co2 laser for a couple years now.  It should prove to be a fairly inexpensive add-on without the laser~Anthony Im looking at 2 one for etching anodized aluminium and a stronger one for cutting.  The etching laser is actually pretty strong at 10 watts and will cut a few light materials but for real cutting im looking at 40 watts~Hi Josh: can you please give us an update? I'm excited to hear how things are coming together. Thank you.~@andrew please keep us updated on laser head, I am keen on this as well.  Hopefully we will have a proper forum to consolidate collaboration between us owners, the company, and (hopefully) future FLXArm users.  The laser project I have been watching is a 450nm 6watt variety that needs a lot of heat dissipation.  What size or laser are you thinking?

That thing looks like it will breakdown in a few weeks.  That's a pure crowdfunding cash grab.  They even hired a crowd funding expert as part of their team. Look at the BS lovefest shes got going on in their comments section.  buyer beware.  Why didn't they mention flux arm in their comparisons companies I'm sure they know of you.  I guarantee they wont deliver on half of what their hyping and the rest will be  toy quality at best and that's after reconfiging it for hours. Really 3d resin printing from a scara robot ...why?  I know lets just throw in the kitchen sink and say it will drive you to work too.  Anything foe the funding.  But one thing is nice about this project... they show us what  we will be able to do with our robots albeit minus the lack of quality on the output.  I don't know about the rest of you but Ive already started prelim work sourcing a laser for a head.  BTW  THATS WHY I WANT ACCESS TO THE FLX.IDE AND THE CAD FILES I HOPE WE GET IT THIS MONTH :o~Hi Josh:~Someone is out to steal your thunder guys https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1849283018/makerarm-the-first-robotic-arm-that-makes-anything~I have no doubt it will be awesome, question is ""when"".  When will it be done?  When will you post an update?  When can I play with some software?  When will you finally deliver some sort of shred of evidence that the product will someday be a reality?  How long would it take you to whip out your phone and snap a photo or two, record a little video of the thing in motion?  Seems you have all your ducks in a row, I just cant figure out why you insist on keeping us in the dark.

That would go along way to quelling the anxiety while waiting and reduce the leaning curve we will have when we get the arms. Im sure nobody would mind if its buggy and again i'm sure the users wouldnt mind refraining from support and requests until you've finalized the commercial version of the software.~With aluminum when I do a small batch myself I clean them with all purpose cleaner and then a short etch in a bath of lye. Plating companies should be equipped to do a quick cleaning before them head to anodizing for you.~Make sure those anodized samples are exactly what you want to see in the final parts. I had to reject a lot of parts and it cost extra machine time on the cnc. Those plating companies have one mission, do it as cheap/fast as possible.~Thank you for the more full update, very excited to see the fruits.  When you take the time to explain what is going on, the ""perceived"" lack of progress is alleviated. ~Would it be possible to snap a photo or two of the new parts somewhere along the way? Did anything other than ""meeting with the anodizer"" get us any closer to a final product?  The perceived lack of progress is something you need to address, time to take more than 30 seconds, and give us an honest state of the union.  You've obviously hit a brick wall, time to come clean guys.~Hi Creator,I can wait so; just send me the working one.~Ah cmon show us the goods guys!  Snapping a pic/video takes seconds and goes a long way to keeping morale high.~We need some video! :)~Please have some good news for us...~Pictures would be good, videos of the new arm would be better, trials and tribulations would add nice colour and context.  I don't think we're looking for polished presentations or delivery certainty yet, just ongoing discussion.~Got some new pictures?~Ping?~Very disappointed, were this the first time this had happened I may have given you the benefit of the doubt.  But sadly, there is a bit a trend going on here.~Even a one-sentence update would be helpful...~No update? :(~Beuller?~?  :(~Looking forward to the update!~I cleared off some bench space for the FLX.ARM. Can't wait to get it!~I love the hangout idea, even 10 minutes would be nice.  Eagerly awaiting :)~",0.0,"$50,000",FLX.ARM: Low-Cost Precision Robotic Arm by Flux Integration LLC — Kickstarter

You and your kids can program it to express feelings, show time and even play games.Vote link: https://www.facebook.com/Makeblock/app_303561899745219Help us reach this goal by sharing our ideas with your friend.Two years ago, Makeblock team launched the first Kickstarter project for helping makers construct their dreams; Two years later, now we come back to Kickstarter again for O.R.P.K (ONE ROBOT PER KID), releasing the easiest educational robot for helping kids learn robotics with fun.Robotics integrate all STEM fields and always make each kid crazy. It can help kids  get hands-on experience on mechanics, electronics, control system and computer science.However, all robots on the market seem to be expensive, hard to assemble, trouble to wire and complex to program. Our goal is to create an affordable, easy-to-use and open source robot for per kid: ONE ROBOT PER KID.mBot is a low cost, easy-to-run robot kit for kids to get hands-on experience about graphical programming, electronics, robotics. It is an all-in-one solution for robotics learning and designed for STEM education. Cute shape with easy assembly is our goal. mBot contains only about 45 pieces in total, so it is easy to have a sense of achievement for kids to assemble in 10 mins quickly.Since Scratch2.0 is very popular in teachers and students as a graphical programming software, it has almost been proved to be the most easy-to-use graphical programming tool. So based on Scratch 2.0, we develop a new software mBlock to use Scratch-style coding to program Arduino and robots. You are free to download from here.New features in mBlock:
Arduino mode: perfect for every beginner to switch from graphical programming to text-based programming. See more improvements we made for easy teaching and learning from BELOW.Arduino is an open-source electronic prototyping platform used by people in the global world to start a project quickly. It has been proved to be very expandable and suitable for beginners. So we designed mBot's electronics based on Arduino platform , which is easy for kids to use and extend , and bring their every idea to life.With intuitional color labels and easy-to-use RJ25 connectors, the board could get wired within a few seconds, so students could get more time to focus on creating all kinds of interactive stories and projects.See more improvements about electronics we made for easy teaching and learning from BELOW.Thanks to the cooperation with Scratch teachers, under their help we provide online manual and  two online courses to help teachers or kids get started easier.  You can get a preview of contents about two books here.mBot is available in two colors Blue/Pink. Everyone can choose his or her favorite color.We designed specially two available wireless communication instead of wired USB cable, so users can enjoy wireless programming to control robots without the limit of USB cable. The Bluetooth Version comes with a Bluetooth module and is suitable for individual usage or team working; The 2.4G Version comes with two 2.4G wireless modules and is suitable for  classroom. Know more details about how to use from video below. The chassis is compatible with Lego&Makeblock parts. And you can use on-hand Raspberry Pi or standard Arduino boards to learn more about electronics or bring kid's more ideas to life.Thanks to Arduino open source platform, there are a lot of sensors to help bring your kid's idea to life. Children can learn not only mBot but also sensors and how to innovate in the real world.You can check more ideas from here.mBot(Bluetooth version) comes with a chassis, two motors, an ultrasonic sensor, a line follower, a remote controller, a mCore, a Bluetooth module and other hardware.mBot(2.4G version) comes with a chassis, two motors, an ultrasonic sensor, a line follower, a remote controller, a mCore, two 2.4G wireless modules and other hardware.In the process of communication with teachers and kids, we have made a lot of improvements for easy teaching and learning.About mechanical parts: Cute design, easy to assembly.About electronics: everything is for safety, durabilty and convenience
About software:everything is for easy-to-use.One Robot Per Kid seems to have a long way to go, but this is where our dreams start: we want to help kids learn programming, electronics, robotics more easily and interestingly with a affordable price. Although we have done a lot of optimization on the design to reduce costs, the factories are unwilling to give a special lower price unless we have a big order. 
So with your support, we can cut down the costs more and the price $49 may be not only the Kickstarter special price but for the retail price. 
With your support, it will be a great encouragement to do more in the educational robot field.

There are no updates in your tracking numbers list, where my shipping status is ""waiting for tracking#"" for two weeks+. Please send me my tracking number!~My No is not on the shipment list. What is happening on my mBot?No reply from Makeblock though I send message to them.Please explain situation.~Received mine in Finland yesterday.~can anyone reply on the enquiry here... there is no reply or updates from the creator. Why some of the backers rcvd thier mBot and some of us still waiting for it. ~I am having no luck receiving any response from them on where my shipment is, no tracking number and no replies....~I can't find my DHL tracking - #2216. What happen with my order.I can change color to any color if it will make shipment available. Thanks, Nipatpong~I put my MBot together last night without a bit of trouble. The instructions were great. I purchased mine with the bluetooth module. All you have to do is follow the instructions and put together. Install the mBot app if you have an iOS device, not sure if Android is available yet. Put in the battery or batteries, I chose to use a 3.7V lipo battery because the mCore board can charge it. Open the mBot app and turn on the robot and off it goes. Everything worked as it was supposed to. No code to load to use the mBot app. This is a great cheap starter robot for children. It should not be over whelming at all as long as they follow the instructions. Plenty of ways to add different sensors and learn code by using mBlock. Anyone that has children should purchase them one of these great learning devices.~We just received a shipping invoice from DHL for $21.73 for the import/export duties and payment deferment of our mBots. We also sent a message in because we didn't receive what we ordered. Can someone please respond to the message I sent on 7/10/2015?~We received our missing mbots in the mail today. No one got back to us so hopefully the rest of you who are missing items - they will arrive. We emailed the support twice and posted and never heard anything but were pleasantly surprised this morning. It took about 10-12 days for the missing pieces to arrive.~Mbot just came in and my 13 year old daughter is working on it right now.  Can't wait.~Escalate? I've been waiting 2 months. I'm ready to escalate.~Any updates on missing items - all my messages are being ignored - no responses to emails, direct Kickstarter messages, or even these comments on the Kickstarter site? I wont like to have to escalate but this lack of response is getting ridiculous!~Havent rcv mine as well....pls update us the status~I'm backer #243 I have not received my mBot and I don't see my number the shipping list.~I am backer 1540, I have not been on any of the lists about shipping. Can you please figure out what happened to my mbot? thanks~I am backer 1058. I am not on the list with shipping info. What can I do to get this fixed? Thank you.~I really need someone to get back to me about our 4 missing mbots. I paid for 10 and have 6 and no one is getting back to us. We bought the education pack. We contacted your support email but haven't heard anything from anyone.~mBots arrived today! Thank you :) Haven't opened them yet as I have a busy week ahead. The kids can't wait to begin. Didn't have to pay anything extra either, so happy about that after reading other comments.~Sorry to push, but I need to know what I can do, as otherwise the robots will be destroyed. As this is not my fault that they have been held up I would like to know what would happen if this was the case...~I am sorry to say that my ones (education pack) are being held by customs as they apparently don't comply to standards, the officials are threatening to destroy them unless I have an import licence. ~Hello. I put this up at the forum but go no response. So I am putting it here as well.~@Holly you can download the instructions from here http://learn.makeblock.cc/mbot-resources-download/~Hi, so I received my mBot but I am missing a page from my instruction manual and don't have steps 1-4 for constructing my robot. Any help in this matter would be great!~I received 6 of the 10 mbots that I purchased - the package invoice said 10 blue mbots but we received 4 green and 2 pink and no blues. I tried to reach support but haven't heard anything. We purchased the educator pack and need the remaining mbots so we can run our sessions. Please adivse and get back to us.~I eventually received my 5 mBots after the shipping notification issues - but I JUST received my 5 2.4G mBots, but not the additional 5 Bluetooth modules for which I paid $75 extra - please send them at your earliest convenience!It seems direct messages in KS and via email are not being responded to so hopefully I'll be successful in getting a response here...~",0.0,"$20,000",mBot: $49 educational robot for each kid by Makeblock — Kickstarter
98," Introducing the Robot Core! 
The Robot Core is a robot control board for the Raspberry Pi and Arduino that brings many different elements into one awesome package!
 You can now power your Raspberry Pi, control motors, servos and read sensors without needing five additional boards to hook up. The boards can even be daisy chained to add even more functionality. Leveraging the design prowess of Freeburn Robotics Limited (PiBorg), we commissioned a board that combines advanced motor control, input, and power on a single core board. Plus, it looks EPIC.  This powerful robotics controller was developed from the ground up for STEM education. Providing a way for educators to engade students early on to pave the way for teaching core topics in robotics, electronics, coding and making.   Easy to connect to:Robot Core uses I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit). I²C is a serial computer bus invented by Philips Semiconductor. I²C is a very easy to use, two wire bus, that your Pi has no problem talking with. A built-in level shifter ensures compatibility to both 3.3 volt and 5 volt I²C buses. You can also easily daisy chain the board and the I²C buss is compatible with hundreds of devices and sensors. It is compatible with all current and past generations of Raspberry Pis and with many Arduinos.  (The Raspberry Pi Zero will need 6 pin headers soldered to it). Open Source:All board files and software will be released at the end of the successful funding of this Kickstarter. Below is a autonomous outdoor robot created with Robot Core during a weekend.   Vast amount of Features:Behold the vast and powerful 
features on the Robot Core board! Wait...do I see a 5 volt 6 Amp DC-DC converter ? Yes. Yes, you do. 

Full list below: Easy to talk to:The board has software provided in the form of libraries and python example programs to get you started fast.   Power:    Motor drive:  Servos:   Dynamixel servos:   Ultrasonics:   Analog:  Software:   Also included: If you find the board is too large for your application, you can always break away the prototyping space on the pre-scored line.  So what can you do with the Robot Core? Below are just some example projects you can create with the board. Robot Core is an all-in-one solution for many projects. With its widely used I²C bus you can daisy chain even more sensors and PiBorg boards. And much, much more....Meet The Team:

99," The MeArm Pi is an award winning robotic arm kit that’s simple enough for a child to assemble. Take control of the world around you. The MeArm Pi is an easy-to-build robot arm kit that's designed to get children (and adults!) learning about technology, engineering and programming. It's been expressly designed to be easy to build (age 11+) and use. At its heart is the Raspberry Pi, a low cost computer that has been developed to make learning about computing accessible and fun. The MeArm Pi can be controlled directly through the on-board joysticks, or you can learn to code by making it move using one of the many programming languages run on the Raspberry Pi. All of the software is free and covers a wide range of skill levels, from absolute beginner to experienced programmer. To make things even easier, it can all be controlled straight from your web browser, with no need to buy additional hardware like monitor, keyboard and mouse. The MeArm Pi has been designed from the ground up to be easy to assemble. Children can build it themselves and we suspect adults may be able to build it unaided too. The only tool you'll need to build it is a hex key, and we include one in the box!Here's a more detailed build video if you'd like to follow the process:People ask how old children have to be to build this kit and of course it depends on the particular abilities of the child but 11+ is our estimate of a reasonable build age. Of course some 9 year olds will be wondering what all the fuss is about! If you're uncertain as to suitability, check out the build video above to see exactly what's involved or get in touch and we'll be happy to advide.Everything you need to use it! We offer two types of kit, one with the Pi included and the other for those who want to use their own.Here's what's included:The MeArm comes in both blue and orange and you'll be able to choose which colour you'd like once we send out our survey.If you order the kit that comes with a Raspberry Pi, you'll also get:By ordering the MeArm Pi with the Raspberry Pi you can be confident that you have everything you need to build and use your MeArm Pi. No messing!The big benefit of being integrated with the Pi is the access to all of the great programming languages that already run on it. We've put a lot of effort into making it simple to start programming your MeArm as soon as you've got it built. Here's a quick video demo of some of the ways of programming it:There are two approaches to programming it; on-board programming and in-browser programmingThe MeArm is controlled directly from the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi via the custom HAT we’ve built. This means that any programming language that is able to control the pins on the Pi can be used to control it. We’ve already had it working with Node.js, Python and Ruby but because it’s all open and documented it’s easy to get other languages controlling it too (Scratch, Perl, Java and Basic should all run with no problems) We’ve also built a neat little app (in Node.js - open source here) making the arm controllable via a web API. It’s possible to program it through the browser in a number of different languages including Python, Javascript, Blockly and Snap! One of the big benefits of this is that you can teach programming without having to plug a monitor into the Pi and without children having to understand concepts like the command line before they can start programming.  Here's a breakdown of the rewards at the different backer levels: This version is the first fruit of the partnership between Ben Pirt and Ben Gray and has been completely redesigned, eliminating 2/3 of the screws and using new fixings which make it way easier for the young to build. The servos are now sent out pre-calibrated so all you have to do is slot them into place, which removes one of the trickiest bits of the build from previous versions. Absolutely! We’ve always been big believers in the power of open source, particularly when it comes to being able to learn about technology. All previous versions of MeArm have been 100% open source in both hardware and software and this model is no exception. We’ve tried to keep the workings of the MeArm Pi as straightforward as possible. The servos are driven directly from the GPIO pins so you can access them easily. The joysticks need an ADC to convert their input so we’ve used an I2C ADC that the Pi can communicate directly with. There’s an on-board RGB LED we use to show status and this too is driven directly from the GPIO pins so that if you want to play around with it (and learn!) you can. For power, we’ve found that the standard 2A Raspberry Pi power supplies work without any issues. If you're plugging more things in to it you might want to use the 2.5A supply. The HAT has a micro USB power input the same as the Pi so you can just switch the power over and the same power supply will power both the arm and the Pi. The HAT follows the reference design for Pi HATs to the letter.Software-wise, there’s a Node.js app we’ve written which can do a few key things:The neat thing about this is that you can run the arm without having to plug it into a monitor and keyboard and control everything through your web browser.As it's just a Node.js library it will run on any OS that supports Node. We've been using it on the stock Raspbian.It’s all open source (of course!) and we’ll be continuing to develop this and add features based on your feedback. Which model Raspberry Pi?The HAT is designed to be compatible with B+ form factor models (those that have 40 pin GPIO headers). It works equally well with the Raspberry Pi 2, 3 and Zero W. Unfortunately it won't work with the early model Raspberry Pi's that had fewer GPIO pins as the HAT won't fit.   Mime Industries is a new company founded by Ben Pirt of Mirobot and Ben Gray of MeArm. (Mi and Me - get it?). We realised we were both building the same company in parallel so decided to join forces for world domination. Between us we’ve successfully run three Kickstarters previously - two for Mirobot and one for MeArm. We know exactly what it takes to fulfil a Kickstarter now and have both spent the last couple of years manufacturing and shipping thousands of robot kits to people in over 60 countries around the world. This is just the first in the lineup of products we have up our sleeve. Stay tuned!   ",Mime Industries,"£56,376",Unstated,"A robot kit for all ages, that's easy to make and control.

The oft mentioned packaging is nice but hardly post proof and the bundled PSU box was properly mangled by Royal Mail. I'm hoping it's all still going to work. Maybe a post-proof outer container rather than a plastic bag next time guys? This is not a t-shirt! Good work otherwise.~Neil , not a power supply problem as now tested with official P3 power supply, i check all servos are connected correctly as per pictures and now at a loss what more i can do ?~@david: The surest sign of a power supply problem is a system crash right after you type in the server startup command ( sudo node ./server.js ). If you have remoted into the Pi with (say) SSH, your session will drop, and you’ll see the lights on the Pi flashing as it reboots. If the Pi runs ok without the HAT on, well and good, and another clue. Your new plug pack should be advertised as “Pi 3 compatible”.~Neil :( sadly mine are plugged in the right way round i'm just waiting for a delivery of a new power supply then maybe unplug everything and test servo's not in the arm~@david. Sorry, finger trouble. See https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/mearm/75KixwxW19I~@david: your servos may be plugged in back-to-front. See~Have any arms been shipped to Australia yet?~hi I am having problems once build apply power it gives a short jerk but does not respond i have tried 3 different power supply's where can i get more help please~Well I guess I must be in the remainig third that according to your last update is still awaiting shipping. Any idea when I am likely to see my Red me-arm-pi?~Great video, Grey! Just what the doctor ordered.~Hey guys, here's the video of mine in action! https://youtu.be/8lPIRYlaQVM~@Cathy. I received the ""brown paper"" shipment in Brisbane some weeks ago. Patience, Grasshopper.~Have you shipped to Australia yet?~As you were: The demos are working (but slew only) after I connect to the server from the webpage. In other words, the ""wave"" goes from side to side only. That suggests a problem on the output side; however in the absence of SIMPLE diagnostics, it's a needle-in-a-haystack guessing game.~Hi! I followed your manual install instructions for stock Raspbian with great success. I can now access the server from my Linux box via wired Ethernet, as discussed (http://RPi201:80). However none of the demos run, and only the slewing joystick control works. There’s a bit of random chatter from the other servos. Will dig deeper when I have time.~Still waiting :(~A couple of snags with my build. The main one being due to the servos not actually being labelled (NONE had the identifying dot). I had to try de-constructing the claw and unfortunately broke part 16 meaning that although it fits in place it no longer retains the servo in place properly :-( I also managed to miss a step in the contruction and wondered why the left and right servos kept working themselves loose. Soon solved when I realised my ""spare"" elastic band wasn't in fact ""spare"" at all! ;-) I must say I'm VERY impressed with the design; very clever how the parts retain themselves (though not meant for DE-construction as I found).~where is my MeArm Pi?How long I must wait from now?~Hi - backer here with excited little girl wondering when our arm might ship...~@KJT, sorry to hear that. We can get you some new struts sent out. If you can email support. There are also a couple of methods that will allow you a fix on those.@SK Sorry you're still waiting! We've had a lot of recutting to do due to the holes problem. Pimoroni were also a Kickstarter backer and ordered 50 units. We're walking a knife edge at the moment as we need to keep taking orders to keep the lights on while we fulfill all of the Kickstarter backers. Each of you is extremely important to us, as are our distributors.~https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/new-products/products/mearm-piStill waiting for my perk...~halfway building it, I couldn't attach the grip to the arm because the holes are too large~thank you~@Mime: I slipped the soldier bridge and it works fine. I included a photo down in that comment in case you want to check it for QA purposes. Everything else looked great. ~Hi there, nr.49 backer here still waiting ?~@Scot Perkins: After seriously about 5 hours of trouble shooting I took the whole thing apart again and discovered a solder bridge on the servo board. Check it out: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5pbvklrstck1auv/2017-10-31%2019.39.29.jpg…~Hi guys, #314 backer here. Just received the goods More to come shortly. Thank you very much. Great packaging. Congrats, great job.~Sorry to be a pedant, but ... while you have fixed the part number of the FET on the schematic, you are still using the wrong symbol. Have a look at https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats/blob/master/zvd-circuit.png~ASSEMBLY TIP! To save money, no nuts are used in construction, meaning metal socket head cap screws screw directly into the plastic, however the holes frequently are too large, or JUST right and then are ruined if you have to take it apart and redo it. I personally find his aggravating beyond reason, they could have simply used cap screws with non-threaded shanks and an extra 2MM on the end for nuts and this would have been MUCH MUCH better/easier. ~@celdran >> J'ai reçu le mien samedi dernier. si tu lisais les updates, tu verrais les explications de pourquoi ils sont en retard au lieu de tout de suite faire de la ""mauvaise"" publicité. Pour avoir déjà eu affaire avec le mirobot et le miArm, je peux dire que ce sont des créateurs sérieux.~Bonsoir le 24 octobre toujours aucun produit je ne vais pas faire de publicité encourageante ni à mime industrie ni à kickstarter~Thanks Neil, I have some very thin plumbers tape which I use for wheel valve threads, so will try that.~Thurston: It should work. The screw goes through the slot in the shim and it's head sets in the hole in the arm. If your kit is the same as mine, the problem will be that the hole in the base is oversized, so the screw fails to grip. There are various ways to make it grip. Maybe the simplest is to feed a length of rubber band or fishing line through the hole before you put in the screw. You could also put in a sliver of plastic from the unused  frame of the kit~So halfway through building it (very nice kit by the way) and step #14 screwing the arm assembly into the base, it states to use a 6mm screw. The problem here is that the screw does not stick out far enough to be able to screw into the centre piece of the base. It just about sticks and does not reach the thread, had to use a 10mm instead from step #7 and with step #7 use the 6mm :)~I find it hard to believe you are using a BSS138 FET in the power supply circuit of the HAT, even though that is what is indicated in the schematic. Wrong type of FET! DMG2305UX seems more likely.~Hi, my MeArm Pi arrived today. Thanks a lot!~Mine arrived too! Well done!~Mine arrived today in a nice box :)   Will get started with it this weekend!!~",0.0,"£10,000",MeArm Pi - A robot arm anyone can build by Mime Industries — Kickstarter
100," GoBox is a fun and easy way to learn programming through a build-your-own robot kit with monthly robotics missions that are delivered right to your door! The first month, you’ll get the GoPiGo robot car, and every month after that you will be assigned a mission to accomplish! Each month, your GoBox will include a new sensor and step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish a mission -- complete with illustrations and links to helpful videos.We believe that the more someone knows about the way technology works, the more effective and successful they will be in any career they choose. However, the way that technology - like engineering and computer science - is taught, caters to those with a specific style of learning, and can often be boring and frustrating for many of us because it requires so much background knowledge. 
 
To solve this, we’re making an easy-to-use robot kit that will enable and excite anyone with any background to learn about coding and technology.
 
With the GoBox, you and your child can explore robotics and programming together, from the beginning. If your skills are more advanced, your monthly GoBox still gives you a fun way to connect, create, and explore new concepts alongside your child, niece or grandchild.We've reached our initial funding goals rather quickly so we are laying out some stretch goals!Stretch Goal 1 ($60,000): We heart Python.  If we reach this stretch goal, we will create parallel materials for each lesson in Python.Stretch Goal 2 ($100,000): Where do robots come from?  We'll develop a feature video that explains how we design and manufacture our robot.The GoPiGo is the foundation of GoBox. GoPiGo is a robot car we designed, built, and launched last year. With the awesome feedback we received from thousands of users and our thriving, creative community, we have learned how to make it easier to assemble, more durable, and a lot more fun to use! All of these improvements will be included in the GoPiGo2, as a part of this GoBox Kickstarter! The GoPiGo is built around a really neat $35 single board computer called the Raspberry Pi (the green board in the picture below). It was developed by a UK foundation a few years back and has taken the education world by storm -- making it easier than ever for young people to get their hands on electronics and learn to program. It's easy to use, and we think it's the best platform for beginners because it doesn't require any prior knowledge. Read more about the Raspberry Pi and the Non-Profit Foundation that supports it here.You can program the GoPiGo in many languages including Python, Scratch, Node.js, and Go. Our awesome community has even developed Windows10 for the GoPiGo! Don't know what any of these languages are?  Don't worry, GoPiGo helps you learn the basic coding languages.When we looked at how to make GoBox accessible and engaging for all skills levels, we decided that developing the missions for the GoPiGo in Scratch was the best option. Scratch is an easy drag and drop language developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for teaching new programmers how to code.  Rather than typical lines of code, you’ll use simple shapes and graphics to program your robot.It’s the gift that keeps on giving. Your monthly GoBox comes with a new sensor for your robot to help you accomplish a mission. Each mission builds on the next, so you are learning new skills and staying engaged over a period of time -- which we believe is the key to success! What’s more exciting than going on a mission? Our team of illustrators, animators, teachers, engineers and designers are crafting beautiful and easy to understand materials that lead you through a story that helps you accomplish something cool with your GoPiGo and each new sensor.  
 
Check out this sample robot Mission, which not only teaches concepts about biomimicry but does so in a way that explains programming concepts like if and else statements, how robots read sensor data, concepts like thresholds, and math concepts like averages and how they apply to coding.Each Mission will be accompanied with helpful videos to get you started and walk you through certain parts of the Mission.Each mission has fundamental engineering principles woven into the mission.  The GoBox teaches new ways to think about how to approach and solve problems.

Each mission presents a problem and provides the tools to approach and solve the problem in your own unique way. Our missions encourage the design theory approach: state the problem, design, build, code, test, and iterate.     

This allows students to find their own answers, and encourages them to come up with their own missions!
With GoBox, you’re not just playing with a robot, you’re actually learning programming concepts without it ever feeling like a computer science class. A robot makes the whole coding and programming experience tangible and real.Some of the concepts that are taught in the 12 GoBox missions include: program structure, if then statements, forever until control structures, variables, loops, nesting loops, waits, sequencing, state machine, inputs and outputs, broadcasting, conditional statements, iteration, variables, random numbers, event handling, parallel execution, and boolean logic.  Aren't sure of what all of these terms mean? No problem - that is exactly what GoBox is meant to help teach.Since GoPiGo can also be programmed in Python, Go, Node.js and a growing list of other languages supported by our community, when you or your child outgrows Scratch, a whole world of powerful programming languages awaits! Also, because the GoPiGo is open source, our active community is constantly adding new examples, languages, and features. The full package. You get the upgraded GoPiGo2 full robot kit delivered to your door before the Holidays. Then, over the next 11 months, we’ll send you a fun new mission for your robot to accomplish with a sensor. The missions are in a story form of step-by-step instructions that take you through the whole experience. You’ll have full access to our video library and support forums as well. The monthly sensors include the light sensor, sound sensor, ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, LED, motion sensor, button sensor, infrared sensor, and the brand new GoPiGo Line Follower.Want a color other than clear?  If you choose the The Custom GoBox Backer Level, you will be able to choose the color for your GoPiGo2 robot body.  We will offer the following custom colors:  When the Raspberry Pi first came out, we realized the power of this little $35 computer -- not only in getting people interested in technology, but learning about robotics! We saw the robot trapped inside each Raspberry Pi that we believe has mass appeal to all kinds of learners.We tested the idea through a Kickstarter campaign for the GoPiGo 1, and were overwhelmed by the response. Since then, we have been doing everything we can to gather feedback and build a better robot that is easier and even more fun to use!We’ve shipped thousands of GoPiGos and received fantastic feedback from our engaged and creative community.  We still weren’t getting where we wanted to be though: a robot that anyone, with any background, can use.We wanted to make it even easier to get started with coding and robotics, so we assembled a team to make a system that could help anyone, with any background learn robotics. And, after redesigning our hardware, software, and now developing missions that pull it all together, we think we’ve done it --  GoBox!
For the past few months we’ve been designing, redesigning, and testing our new materials with groups of parent-child teams, and transforming our lessons into missions that teach robotics in a fun way.We’re devoted to robotics education. Our company has been around for five years, and we are passionate about designing and making robots that people enjoy using.

She's a positive force of nature that gets us all organized and operating smoothly.By far the biggest accomplishment with the GoPiGo has been establishing an open, supportive and growing community. Our inspiration, the source of our feedback, and our wellspring of ideas has been the Dexter Industries community. By backing our project, you become part of that community, and with it, get access to a wide breadth of knowledge and support that is shared on our forums, newsletters, Facebook, and Github.We take immense pride in having three successful Kickstarters under our belt! We’re getting pretty good at figuring out the manufacturing side of a successful Kickstarter project, and making sure we deliver what we promise.  
We’re developing curriculum.
GoBox is a sequence of missions designed to take you step-by-step through your journey of learning programming and robotics. In order to do this well, we have illustrators, designers and artists, working alongside engineers and professional educators that have developed curriculums and learning programs for decades. Everyone on our team is passionate about developing the most effective and engaging program that’s out there! Manufacturing robots!We’re setting up the tooling, designing beautiful packaging, and building systems for testing the GoPiGo2, the Line Follower, and other sensors included in your GoBox.Based on our past experience of what it takes to do these types of projects, we’ve set our goal at $30,000. We’ll be able to deliver a high quality program that will thrill any adult-child team. However, surpassing that goal will allow us to develop even cooler missions — so if you want to see how crazy things could get, share with your friends, family and school.Delivery by the Holidays!
Delivery by the Holiday Season! We’re committing to getting the first GoBox to our backers in time for the 2015 Holiday Season (latest delivery of Dec 20th).  
Every month after...
What’s better than getting a robot for Christmas? Well, GoBox is even better because it’s the gift that keeps on giving — with a new mission and equipment delivered every month for the rest of the year!Where we’re at right now...
As of our launch, we have the hardware and software designed and prototyped. We have a manufacturing plan in place as well as agreements setup with our suppliers. All that’s waiting on the hardware end is for us to give the signal!We have the first few lessons written (see our example lesson here!), tested, and graphically illustrated. We’re working on the next eight, with most of the content developed. Over the next three months we will have these final lessons tested, iterated on, illustrated, and polished.Please share this with friends, family, and colleagues to help us bring this to life!",Dexter Industries,"$135,361",Unstated,The robot kit with a new mission delivered monthly.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,439 ," On November 28. you stated you would ship out a replacement MicroSD card on Monday (November 30) Today is December 5 and I have received neither the replacement nor any notice as to when I can expect it. It does NOT take more than 3 business days to receive mail from Arlington,VA to Cleveland Heights, Oh. I am very upset! Without the properly encoded MicroSD card, all I have is a VERY EXPENSIVE DOORSTOP!  What is up? When will I receive my replacement MicroSD card?~The author of this comment has been deleted.~Thank you. I can't wait to get started!~As I stated in my previous comment - I received the SD Card Adapter (Caddy) which was EMPTY. It DID NOT contain the MicroSD Card. PLEASE, PLEASE mail me a replacement MicroSD CARD as without it my GOBOX is dead in the water!~Here is an unboxing video from my 8 year old twins. They will be doing a video for the assembly and each of the monthly projects as well! https://www.youtube.com/watch…I thought it might be fun for you guys to have video of kids using the kit!~My GOBOX  arrived at the Post Office on 11/27/2015 at 0456 and was delivered to my door at 17:32. When I arrived home, I carefully unpacked the package and examined all parts for completeness. Everything was correct EXCEPT for the MicroSD card which only contained the caddy. The actual MicroSD card containing the Operating System was  missing! I can only assume that this was the result of a minor ""glitch"" in packing.Please send me a replacement MicroSD card ASAP.  Thank you.Larry Howard Mittman~I've been sent two messages in the last couple of weeks stating my package is on its way but with two different tracking numbers?Also the tracking info just states that the pre-shipment info has been sent to USPS?Please explain?~This is going to be a gift for my grand kids and I will give it to them pn Christmas. Will I be able to change the address for delivery.of the subsequent monthly projects?~Can an IPAD be used to program the GoPiGo?~i have the same q as kari~Can I get my first shipment to a different address? I'll be welcoming a new grandson into the world and would like to be able to deliver these first kits for Christmas to their recipients. But then I'll be going back home and will want to ship packages from there.... Is that possible?~If I bought the package with two do they both ship in one box to one address?  Or woudl it be possible to ship to separate addresses?  I see a lot of concern about shipping costs here, so whatever is possible is okay...just hope it might be possible for two addresses.~Not sure if this has been asked but would the ZeroPi currently on Kickstarter work with GoPiGo?~The author of this comment has been deleted.~The Gobox comes with 9 sensors. What's the max number of sensors that we can attach to the GoPiGo? ~wood and replacement?~Purple, definitely!~Would love to see green come out.  Might just have to up my funding for a green robot kit~OK thanks for the explaining your reasoning behind your backer levels but can you explain your last sentence regarding the coupon please?~+1 for missions for the camera~Hey it would be good to see an international delivery pledge level that included the Servo Package and Camera ie an advanced level delivered every quarter.Or will it be possible to just pledge for the GoBox international and then add the Servo Package and Camera by increasing the pledge by some $?~Having python support will be a great addition, and carefully produced lessons that introduce and demonstrate python will really expand the learning potential of the kit.  Thanks!~Love the idea of Python lessons for the stretch goal.  Looks like that goal will be achieved soon.  Would love to see missions for the camera module, especially for those who pledged the Advanced level.~So glad your Stretch Goal #1 is creating the lessons in Python!  If you need an extra set of eyes to look at the materials & code, I'd be happy to help.~here's my take as a parent. If I receive a box every three months, it's manageable to hide it , re-pack it and present it to the kids once a month. Especially if it comes in three distinct packages inside the one shipment. It's a compromise that I could live with.~We would have gone with the $339 level pledge, but shipping drove the total cost outside of our budget.~Monthly shipping is the perfect timing. However for non-US residents, shipping costs are too prohibitive. It's approx. 60% extra.  (120$ shipping cost, on a reward worth 189$ - Other countries see 160$ shipping fees for the same reward) ~This is for my grandchildren, so having a new project for them each month is part of the excitement.  I live in the U.S. and shipping each that much of a concern for me.  I'd rather have a 'present' for them each month.  Out of 9 grandchildren, I'm trying to see if any are interested in STEM.  My degrees are in ComSci.~",0.0,"$30,000",GoBox: The robot kit with a new mission delivered monthly. by Dexter Industries — Kickstarter
101," Every inventor has a story from their childhood where they ruined their Mom's vacuum cleaner or their own toys, trying to ""find out how it worked.""We wanted to create a robotic toy that not only could be taken apart to ""see how it works"" but encourages that kind of exploration so that a new generation of engineers and scientists can be created.At Slant we are working to create kits and tools that get kids excited about technology. Robotics is the best means of doing this since it is so multidisiplinary. Biology, Physics, Mechanics, Electronics, Art, they are all components of Robotics. The trouble is robotics can be scary for kids and expensive for classrooms. Not anymore. The LittleBot is a simple but expandable robot to get kids started with the possibilities of robotics. Press Materials Here.LittleBot is a small 3D printed Arduino personal robot for STEM, fun, making, and even research.What He can DoApplicationsLittlebot is a fun toy, but he is mainly an educational tool. With resources from  this campaign we will be working to create tutorials and explanations of how each part of him works so that kids can learn from him.Electronics Assembly of the LittleBot is easy enough that kids can do it. and while doing so they see how electronics come together to create the body of a robot.But the main electronics board is designed to be expanded on. So kids and makers can create new sensors and circuits and easily implement them into the LittleBot. ProgrammingUsing Graphical programming tools like Blockly and Scratch kids can program the LittleBot. And since all of our Arduino C code is available for download, kids can see examples of how written code controls a robot. We will also be creating more examples in the future. Physical DesignElectronics and programming is great. But we live in a physical world. The LittleBot allows kids to create parts for it using tools like TinkerCAD and then 3D print them to see their designs come to life. These designs might be decorations for the robot or whole new sensor arrays to strap on.LittleBot has been designed to be a minimalist approach to robotics. When kids are learning they don't need, a flashlight, accelerometer, tweezers, and a supercomputer on-board. Those things just add complexity and increase the fear of getting started.LittleBot has what a kid needs to see what is possible with robotics, but then offers the expandability to go beyond that. But to go above and beyond, the Bluetooth allows the robot to be controlled by a computer running things like vision software. Extra servos can be attached for grippers and other peripherals, and the list goes on. You can even add WiFi capabilities to the LittleBotThe BrainThe onboard brain of the LittleBot is a Arduino on a custom circuit board that we use for nearly all of our robots.The board allows for maximum expandability, including other servos, and more sensors. Its Bluetooth dock also allows you to connect to smart devices and create apps for the robot with tools like App Inventor.  The SensorsLittleBot has multiple sensors. The most notable are the ultrasonic sensors that make his eyes. These let him see things up to 2 feet in front of him and as close as 4-5 inches.The other sensors available are external attachments and can be added when someone wants to use them. We have created 2 external sensor arrays so far. We will create more in the future.Extra Sensors   SoftwareLittleBot has essentially two modes right out of the box. Remote Control and Autonomous. In the remote mode he is controlled using an Android Smartphone app. In autonomous mode LittleBot uses his 'eyes' to interact with the world. When he sees something he will avoid it by generating some kind of reaction. This reaction is completely unique and is meant to surprise and encourage engagement. He is not a ""wind-up"" toy that just repeats regular actions, that would not be interesting, he is truly a robot that sees the world, thinks about it, and then takes some action.All of the software for the LittleBot is entirely open-source. It is written in Arduino and C, allowing for a huge number of resources for beginner roboticists to draw from. Also, since the software is based on Arduino, you can use tools such as Scratch and Blockly to program it as well.In the future we will be adding to the software creating more and more functions and abilities for the LittleBot.LittleBot Maker KitThe Maker Kits contains all the electronics and mechanical components you need to 3D print and then build your own LittleBot. 3D Printing files will be provided at the end of the campaign.  LittleBot Basic KitThe LittleBot Basic kit, is just the LittleBot, all electronics mechanics, and 3D printed parts, with no extra peripherals. Assemble him and start using the app and wander modes right away. LittleBot Basic AssembledJust add batteries and download the app. LittleBot Plus Kit Basically the Plus is a Full LittleBot Kit with Gripper included.LittleBot Plus AssembledJust Attach the gripper, add batteries and download the Android App.LittleBot Ultra KitEverything we have already listed but also with:The LitteBot is the youngest sibling in the LittleBot Family, His older brothers were far less mobile. The orignal LittleArm started as a small garage project that ended up becoming a formal product at Slant Concepts that has continued to grow.Slant is a design shop. Several engineers and designers from all over the world work remotely to create various products. Most recently those products have been 3D printed robots. Slant was founded by Gabe Bentz to created truly useful robotics technologies. Slant is now responsible for many different products. One is Slant 3D, a 3D printing farm that can produce thousands of parts without the cost of molds. Another is the ShopArm, which is a 3D printed SCARA robot.  ",Slant Robotics,"$5,575",Unstated,"The simplest Arduino robot for kids to learn engineering, programming, and robotics.

102," XPlotter is designed to create a new definition of plotter. By integrating the laser engraver and cutter into the mechanism, it becomes a versatile yet affordable desktop tool for artists, craftsmen and makers to set their imagination free. XPlotter is not just capable of simulating real effects of handmade drawing and writing, cutting out and laser engraving on different materials as people like, but also be able to pick and place objects with great accuracy, leaving room for secondary development on more applications. The writing of XPlotter features handmade effects. Indeed, the process is almost the same as that of a human hand writing. It is accomplished stroke by stroke with a real pen at certain angle to the paper but just by a robotic arm, which moves in a steady programmed way. XPlotter allows you to produces good writing in any fonts and styles you like without making any typos, stains on the paper, while retaining the realistic feel of hand writing. Pen is not the only choice for XPlotter. As the pen holder is adjustable, it fits various implements, such as pencils, markers, charcoal, chalks and so much more.  People often feel comfortable and respected in front of nice hand writings. You can spread this feeling through people around you with the help of our XPlotter. There could be a wide range of applications:XPlotter draws pictures in two different ways. The drawing can be executed in pen, ballpoint pen, water color, pencil, etc.You can choose a picture and upload it on the computer. Then XPlotter could start draw it on the paper. It is not simply “printing” the images you choose but a process involves a lot of techniques. Like the cute cats we present to you, in order to portray the texture of the fluffy fur, XPlotter uses varied length and density of lines to render the shading on the cat, making them look more vivid and real. On the contrary, printers often fail to reappear the texture and details of the original picture.   You can also let XPlotter to draw on its own via the program, that’s how the colorful tree was painted. Unlike the upload-and-draw way, XPlotter will totally listen to his internal voice (the program) and create images randomly without repeating the same for twice. Every picture is unique. What an original artist! XPlotter is more than a plotter. It could transform into laser engraver if you want. From wood, leather, fabric to kraft, there is a wide range of materials it can engrave directly on. Equipped with a powerful laser, XPlotter is able to engrave a work of art within a short of time. Engraving on Anodized AluminiumYou must be tired of using the same products as any other. How about customize your individual style? For instance, you can engrave your own phone case and music box, or anything that is suitable for laser operation. Turning your (or other people’s) favorite picture into a laser-engraved form could also be amazing and of great fun. Let alone it can help make unique gift to the person you care.Use laser engrave to do Printmaking is also very easy. Safety is always what we concern about. Lasers are potentially hazardous as it could be powerful enough to burn and cut things. The laser we use is of high power, in order to minimize the potential risks of laser accidents, we offer a specifically designed goggles for XPlotter to protect your eyes during laser working. On the other hand, a Velcro sticker pad was designed for Laser head with a view to avoid excessive scattering of laser. If unfortunately, (we wish it would never happen) you expose your skin under the working-on laser head before you realize it, pls press the quick shut down key as soon as possible to avoid further injury to the skin. We hope you can enjoy yourself on engraving but stay alert is necessarily important.If XPlotter can be laser engraving, then why shouldn’t we make the cutting accessible?XPlotter laser cutter is a great tool that expands the field of creation from the two-dimensional world to a three-dimensional one. XPlotter is capable of cutting up to 3 mm of wood.Once the pieces were cut out from the board, the happy time of assembly would start. You can make yourself a decorative lampshade or other interesting works involves in fitting and assembling. Models require high precision can also be done by XPlotter. It would be convenient for architects, artists and makers to build up their own models unmistakably through our XPlotter. Since XPlotter could cut graphs into tangible pieces, it provides a good chance to verify the prototypes in a more direct way, e.g. making a moving Nautilus Gears.You might be wondering if it was possible for XPlotter to cut materials that is thin and light. Because as we all know the thinner the material is, the harder the cutting will be done. But our answer is “Yes”.  XPlotter has no problem with that. It is able to cut complicated and delicate patterns out from thin materials as a scissor or pen knife does to it, but the edges will be soother and clearer. For example, the XPlotter can make a exquisite paper cutting on a sheet of thin paper. It can deal with all the details carefully without breaking any ties between the hallow patterns.Making a Laser Cut Leather Lamp at home is no longer impossible. “X” is a mysterious letter, indicating something or someone that is unknown or unclear, which requires endless exploring and discovering. That is exactly what we wish for our robot. We want you to always have an expectation on our work. XPlotter could be far beyond a plotter, a laser engraver and a cutter if you let yourself go out of the box. We managed to make a built-in vacuum pump system, enable XPlotter to pick and place at a high speed and feature a precision within 0.012mm. It only takes you a few minutes to change the end effector into a vacuum suction cup, which is powerful enough to grab spherical items. We will open source the interface for you to conduct a secondary development. For example, you can make XPlotter to play the chess with you. XPlotter can become a medium for your further innovations. Facebook | Twitter | Youtube | Google+ We have developed 5 prototypes of XPlotter, improved the hardware for more than 10 times. Finally we choose to use the all-medal CoreXY as the main structure for enhancement. The product becomes more solid and stable and can move very fast. Now the final XPlotter is ready to release. Below images present the improvement process of our main prototypes in different periods.Our goal is to make a product that integrated the functions of a plotter, a laser engraver and a cutter but comparatively at a lower cost, making it accessible to more people. Added functions mean added complexity. But we managed to simplify the steps and keep it easy to use. At the same time, we open source the operation interface to welcome more amazing applications made by our users through the secondary development. We offer an easy-to-use operating software for different application scenarios. The software will work on Windows and Mac OS.   The mainboard we used is ATmega2560, Arduino compatible. We will open source the operation interface for users to extend their own applications on the basis of the XPlotter.You can also use XPlotter by the 2.8 inch touch screen and SD without connecting to the computer. There are 7 members in our team so far:Eric Wang leads this team on project management and business.Jerry Peng is the software and algorithm engineer in the team.James Wang is the mechanical engineer.Wanhong Zeng is the electronic engineer.Yi Yang works for the supply chain part.Kebo Shi works for the manufacturing part.Lichun Deng is the Graphic Designer.",PineconeRobotics,"$403,700",Unstated,"An affordable and easy to use desktop Plotter, Laser Cutter and Engraver.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,827 ," @Wildcat JM I too have grumbling on the X-Axis on the far right end.

Nothing.....~@-Tj- Thanks you very much for such detailed instructions. You are a life saver! Now I managed to use my XPlotter in both laser and painting stuff.~I keep sending msg not reply even I didn't receive it till now unfair from kickstarter I had to cancel my visa coz most I backed not revived till now I don't trust this them anymore~I too,  5 emails 4 messages all unanswered.   So very very disappointed with their ""customer service""~I didn't receive my item and respon from ur side regarding not receiving it til now~@Matthew Callahan, i've got the same issue as you. In addition, my machine keeps stuttering on the X axis quite a bit. It makes a jarring sound that gives me the impression of a stuck gear or something. But it resets to the starting position, everything is find and dandy.~I siding receive my item till now am in Saudi Arabia~I have sent a snapshot showing the damaged machine to the creator. 3 weeks later and no update. I guess the word ""soon"" does not mean the same thing in Chinese. The creator is not responding to my private messages; although he logs in from time to time.~@Roth: and there's reddit.  https://www.reddit.com/r/XPlotter/~@Roth: Facebook-group ""XPlotter Community Global""~Is there a dedicated forum for Xplotter users yet? I've been playing quite heavily with mine, calculating ideal speed/power for different materials, calculating the (non-) linearity of the laser power, influence of speed on precision, etc.. And I would love to share those infos and speak about it with other users!~I have to say that I really like the XPlotter. I can't stop cutting and engraving things! What a great Kickstarter campaign. I use osx 10.12.6 and USB-C and everything works like it should.~I've followed your videos and when I go to select a small image to scan and etch, the machine will etch multiple lines outside the image location.   In addition, the laser will continue to make multiple horizontal lines inside the image when there are none.~@Mito Goto: Windows or OSX? You can download the Windows files (Painter, GUI and Driver) at our Facebook-group ""XPlotter Community Global""~I can't download SD card test file about the G-code commands.There is something wrong with the download link.~I can't download SD card test file about the G-code commands.~I tied to download the software, but there is only display “We're sorry, this content cannot be displayed. Please try again later.”.  Please anyone tell me when is “later”... or any solutions?~Hi, I received my XPlotter but there isn't any instruction manual. I don't have the time to figure out and would like to see if there is anyone would like to have this item. It's in its original package. I am willing to take a loss. My XPlotter has XPlotter Laser  XPlotter + Pen Holder + Laser (You will get a fully assembled XPlotter Basic, a Pen Holder, a 2.5W Laser, a Goggles, a USB Cable and a 12V Power Supply. I paid $499+ Shipping. The final retail after Kickstarter is $599.)~Has anyone figured out the stray lines it does off the project and back on?~Hi creator, my software makes output of position data, X and Y array. Can you make function to import x,y excel file or open your source code?~Anyone been having issues with any of the laser cutting paths going slower than they're supposed to? I had a path that cut so slow that it burned the paper flaky along the edges. It was way below the 100 speed setting.~@Joongjin Park:That shoudn't be much of a problem.The output of your software must be g-code (commands provided on pinecone.ai). Either saved as a file and put on a SD-card or directly fed via the serial-port.~Hi, I received the tablet today but the LCD screen appears to be damaged and there are no instructions on how to use it.Please advise.Thank you~I haven’t received mine yet.

What a joke!!~I still haven’t received my pledge~Software?    My issue is when trying to download the software application for Windows, my firewall system is blocking the link as it states “255bits.com” is a dodgy site?~Teeny: I thought the same... should have been a manual... but go to their web site and check out the installation video, it is actually very accurate and got me through the process easily.~Hello!~The pen holder stopped working. Could I just return that piece for a replacement?~There is no instruction manual. Can someone tell me how to get started?~Lol I guess I may have spoken too soon or didn't knock on wood or something. My XPlotter just ""broke."" I put that in quotes because I don't think it actually broke, just a screw came undone, specifically the belt tightness screw, the 25mm M3 Allen Screw. I managed to get it back in after a few tries, but the belt was misaligned the first time, and I overtightened, causing the too-tight belt to bend one of the belt guides. At least it gave me an opportunity to see how the machine was put together in this area. The belt tightness screw could probably use a dab of thread locker to tighten it up if it's prone to undoing itself, unless there's a reason it shouldn't be thread locked. I'm guessing the vibration of the head is what caused it to fall off.~I haven't figured that out. I have a feeling we won't have that kind of functionality till they release the instructions on how to program the cutter, or the software gets added functionality for it. For now I've just been feeding it two images like you probably have. Seems to get the job done, but it could definitely get to be a pain for longer jobs.~Have you guys figured out how to send one picture to the laser engraver with two settings, one to laser cut and the other to engrave? Here is the use case: I am trying to cut coasters and engrave in the middle. I need the edges to be cut and the engraving to not cut, just engrave. I am trying to do that in one load, instead of two diff pictures. ~Mine arrived without issue, with all parts and everything assembled seemingly solidly. This thing is fun as heck! :D I've had some issues with laser engraving, like the random lines some folks have been experiencing, but I've only experienced it once out of all the times I've used it so far. I'll keep an eye out for what may have caused this to happen.~For those that have begun playing with their units how much smoke does it create ? I am asking because in my apartment we have smoke detectors and automatic sprinklers and I don't want to accidentally trigger them~My plotter arrived two weeks ago (October 9 in Idaho), and I figured I should mention so here. Set it up this past weekend, pairing it with Windows 10. The two programs–GUI and Painter–are sort of finicky to work with, but I successfully burned an image on some paper and then wood. To say I was giddy during this process–going from sketch, to program, to burned into wood–would be an understatement.~To update my comment of the bars coming out,, under the machine and the end of the bars are grub screws mine were not tight so I would advise everyone to check them~Still waiting for my order.~They do a bit. Seems the only thing they reply to is inquiries to tracking numbers. They posted their email in one of the threads. But some people complained of them not answering that either. I have a unit that is having issues too, with no response.~Question: Has anyone been able to contact the Creator of this project?  My unit arrived with a damaged microswitch and I'd like to get a replacement switch so that I can start using this unit.  But it appears that the Creator doesn't monitor these comments.~Thanks! I’ll try it~Cordairo put your finger behind the black box where both rods go into and check they are level as in not sticking out too much on both rods and both sides I believe as they come loose they rub on the belts and create friction but not sure if that I.S your problem still waiting for the creator to get back to me about my issue as I believe in the long run everyone will have the same problem~Hi, I still haven’t received my order. Can someone please update me? Thanks~@tressalian any idea on how to fix the running clicking sound?~tried creator, asked for your email to sort out problem but no response so I’ll let everyone here know what has happened, was engraving with laser scanning half way through picture the laser head came off the the head itself but both rails on which it slides on,, to my surprise I noticed both rods have no stoppers at both ends meaning if not greased the head WILL pull out the rods the weird noises people are hearing could be the rods rubbing on the belts I would advise everyone to be present when laser engraving and making sure rods ain’t touching the belts as it will end up tearing them off lucky for creator I can’t send photo, being an engineer I fixed it but rods still loose and trying to find a way to secure permenatly~I received a laser that doesn't work. Won't light up, even during testing and they won't get back to me about a replacement laser.

103," What in the World is This Thing?The Vorpal Combat Hexapod is a 3D-printed, Bluetooth-controlled, Open Source, low cost educational robot. It uses the Scratch drag-and-drop programming language developed by MIT (and already used by many schools).  It's made from standard Arduino hardware and other open source or commonly available components.This robot is mesmerizing for adults and kids alike, and draws students into the world of STEM unlike anything else.We provide the Vorpal Combat Hexapod both in kit form and fully assembled and tested! In kit form, you can either 3D print the parts yourself, or get the Full Kit which includes all 3D printed parts.You can maneuver the Vorpal Combat Hexapod using its included 3D printed gamepad which can trigger 60 different motions useful in many different activities. The gamepad has an SD card and can even record motions and replay them. Even better: you can write Scratch programs to create your own custom hexapod motions and upload them onto gamepad buttons for use in games and activities! There's no other hexapod that has this kind of sophisticated yet easy-to-use functionality.This product was designed specifically for:The fact that the structural parts are entirely 3D printed means Makers and schools with access to 3D printers can save a lot of money by just purchasing the Basic Kit, which has everything they need (such as motors, electronics) other than the 3D printed parts and batteries. This makes the Vorpal Combat Hexapod just about the least expensive wireless hexapod kit on the planet, especially considering the amazing features this robot has!Just want the bare minimum at a fantastic price? Pledge for our Bare Bones kit, you supply the 3D printed parts and we give you just enough electronics and other parts to run the hexapod with gamepad. No extras like sensors or SD card reader for the record feature, but you can add those later if you like.Want a great learning tool that goes beyond the basics? Consider the Basic Kit. You provide 3D printed parts, we give you all the bare bones parts plus sensors and SD card reader.Don't have a 3D printer or Maker Space nearby? No problem, we'll provide all the 3D printed plastic parts with our FULL KIT and this robot will still cost a fraction of other hexapods out there.Don't want to build it, just play with it and maybe learn programming? Again, we have you covered! A fully assembled and tested version is available, and you'll still be able to buy two or more of these for the price of one similar hexapod.What sets this project apart from other educational robots is the huge number of different ways it can be used by teachers, home schools, scouting groups, or others to learn about technology. There are fun, informative activities (posted on our website) that can be used by the youngest grades up through challenging tasks for high school and even college. You can keep it simple or get as complex as you want with the Vorpal Combat Hexapod.There are four different packages to choose from depending on your needs:You can add $25 to any support level and also receive our absolutely awesome Vorpal Combat hexapod T-Shirt!We want to bring the Vorpal Combat Hexapod to the world! I coached and taught Robotics at the high school level for ten years, and I know how students learn technology, what excites them, and what motivates them to go deeper into the subject. I've worked with wheeled robots, even space-based robotic satellites in the Zero Robotics competition. I've seen reaction by students and adults to many different kinds of robot.Here's the bottom line: When I first started demonstrating a prototype of this project over a year ago, I never saw such a reaction to any robotic display. Adults, teenagers, toddlers, it didn't matter. All I had to do was fire up the little hexapod robot and make it walk and dance, and people were instantly hooked--they wanted to know more.That's what makes this project such an important educational tool. Students need only drive the robot for a few seconds to get hooked on technology. To them it seems like a game (Capture the Flag, Joust), but they're learning the complexities of walking gaits ... then you tell them they can program it themselves using a simple drag-and-drop interface, and they're drawn in to the world of technology!It sure has! We donated eight robots to the Partnership for Appalachian Girls' Education (PAGE) for a summer program they ran for rural adolescent girls this past summer. One of my interns, a biomedical engineering student at Duke, ran the robotics activity that used our hexapods. This was the first time the PAGE summer program had a robotics activity! For six weeks girls in grades 6 through 9 used an early version of the Vorpal Combat Hexapod.The results were amazing! One girl was overheard saying, ""I can't believe I'm actually building a robot!""  Another was so excited by the Scratch programming that she cut other mandatory activities to get more sessions with the hexapods. (My intern looked the other way!)At the end of the summer program, one of the students was asked what the PAGE program was all about, and she gleefully said, ""Robotics!"" even though that was just one of many activities.To follow more of our success stories, see our Facebook page: The funding from this campaign will allow us to buy parts in large enough quantities to make this project the most economical and full featured hexapod robot on the market today. This will allow many more schools, home schools, Makers and hobbyists to afford this great project. Some of the funding will also be used to add several more 3D printers to our manufacturing facility so we can fulfill more orders from customers who don't have 3D printers of their own.NOTE: Batteries are not included.  Battery requirements: Warranty: Each hexapod kit comes with a 30 day money back guarantee (you just pay shipping back to us) and a 90 day parts warranty.",Steve Pendergrast,"$38,355",Unstated,"A low cost, open source, wireless, 3D printed, Scratch programmable Hexapod Robot designed for games, education, and FUN!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,224 ," GITD printed parts will make for great night time battles....~@Papje, First one is Light BLue, the second Magenta. Both printed in eSUN PLA+~@Creator I've been playing around with OnShape a little and it's incredible. I am by no means a CAD expert, just dabbling with OpenSCAD, Tinkercad and the like to create some simple designs. I think OnShape is the first powerful CAD program that I just might be able to use, at least to modify existing designs. I had no idea such a powerful, relatively easy to use program existed, let alone free to use for hobbyists creating public designs. For instance, I was able to change the number of oval holes in the cap from 24 to 12 to make it possibly easier to print. Could easily play around with the outline shape as well. Thanks so much for making your wonderful design available in this great program, Steve!!! (BTW, I cross-posted this on Thingiverse; I'm not sure where the best place is to post. Do you have a preference?)~@Papje, I printed a dark blue body with yellow legs and hinges. I made the gamepad a lighter blue.~I like the name “Fred”!~Just a little poll, in which color are you printing “Fred” the hexapod?~Cheers Steve, updated my pledge. Thanks for all the effort.~Can I use a 2S 7,4V lipo in this hexapod? Especially for the weight of this lipo, how much weight can it handle?~Or you can buy the 3xAAA to 18650 adapters on amazon.~Perhaps design a AA to 18650 adapter?  You'd have to source some +/- plates for the adapter but that might be easier?~Hi Steve, thanks for the thought. Would it be possible to kick in some funds to get both types of battery boxes?~Has anyone else tried running Scratch with Safari on MacOS High Sierra? It works fine on my older MacBook Pro running Sierra but I have an unusual problem with my 2016 MacBook Pro running High Sierra. Everything works except for the menu items Load/Save Project (or Download to/Upload from My Computer). When I select these items, nothing happens. No error, no action, no nothing. Chrome works fine though. I posted to the Scatch forum but have not gotten any responses. Thanks.~Hi Daniel Thomas, all the details are here in the wiki:http://www.vorpalrobotics.com/wiki/index.php…~Im new to this kinda a stuff, could you put a link to the batteries i should use for the gamepad and hexapod?~That's very helpful.  I through (re)heating the parts might soften them enough for fitting.  I will give it a try.  Thanks for the tip on shells also.  Got the octopi all set up.  Now we just need the CR-10. :)~@Creator Question re: printing.  We're getting our first printer in a few days, and I hadn't planned to jump straight in to ABS.  Can PLA be heated with a hairdryer to avoid cracking/splitting during those tight press fits?  Also, how many outer layers do you usually print?  I saw the infill recommendation, but may have missed the layer spec.~Ohh yh I know, was just corious if changes was still made, but thx for reply, and this awesomeness!~I fundet 139 , i spinder when the 3d printed files are ready to download and Be printed on my printer? :)~My 10 year old daughter is in a STEM program and participates in a VEX-based robotics club after school.  The other kids are going to go nuts when they see her building a Vorpal Hexbot. :)  It will be great to see her use Scratch for more than creating simple games and animations as well.  Thanks for the great project!~Actually, the better charger with 4 white batteries is only 4 bucks more and can charge other types of batteries. I ordered that one.~@Creator Great info, Steve! Based on that I will probably go ahead and order the white EBL batteries. They have 2 chargers: the white 839 and the more expensive 992. It's clear the 992 cuts off automatically which is handy if I forget about the battery in the charger. It looks like you have to remember to remove the battery from the 839 soon after the light changes to green. Based on that, I will probably go with the 992 but any further light you can shed on this would be appreciated. Thanks!~@Creator Thanks for the battery info, Steve. You're the best! Really jazzed about this project.~Got in as an early bird basic backer after seeing your fun project on Thingiverse. I'm trying to select batteries on Amazon but it's very confusing between flat tops/nipples, protected or not, battery quality. I see you recommend EBL but even they come in multiple varieties and their charger does not seem to stop when the batteries are charged. Could you be more specific about what to select please? Also, Outlite and Fixed Star seem to have chargers that stop automatically; any experience with them? Thanks!~Hi Steve, have you thought of doing any add-ons? I'd be keen for to buy some spare servo's.~@Creator. Ok. Thanks for a fast reply. One more question, what size is the biggest part in this kit (for us who print it)?Is it the final design released on Thingiverse or is it ""work in progress"" still?~@Creator. Please look in too a cheaper shipping alternative, I think many possible pledgers avoid this project due to expensive shipping.~Hi Steve,~It’s not clear to me how to charge the 18650 batteries, is this through the usb connector?~Hi Steve & Vorpal Crew, congratulations on funding. A quick question regarding the 18650 battery holder, is it long enough to accommodate protected 18650 button tops, or only the standard unprotected 18650s? Cheers.~Great design! I'm printing out all the parts as I type - PETG is working well.

106," Tens of thousands of whales are killed or injured every year as a direct or indirect result of human activities. The health of ocean ecosystems is tied directly to the health of whales. If we continue to lose whales, the results will be disastrous not just for the oceans, but for our entire planet.We need better technology to understand and document our impact on whales and their habitat. And we need tools that don’t further harm or harass them. And, most importantly, we need YOUR help.Healthy oceans are critical to humanity’s survival. By supporting Snotbot, you are leaving a legacy for future generations and ultimately helping to preserve Planet Ocean.We need your help to fund the purchase and construction of new drones, expeditions into the field to collect samples, and data analysis and dissemination. By funding this work you are supporting the development of a new data collection tool that will be easily replicable by others as well as the collection of critical data that is of benefit to whales and ultimately humanity. Snotbots are custom-built drones created in partnership between Ocean Alliance and Olin College of Engineering. They hover in the air above a surfacing whale and collect the blow (or snot) exhaled from its lungs. Snotbot then returns that sample back to researchers a significant distance away.Here is an extended interview with Ocean Alliance CEO Iain Kerr and Sir Patrick Stewart about Snotbot. With your help we can get it into the field where it matters!Having a lung lining sample is crucial. With it we can see virus and bacteria loads, analyze DNA, and look for environmental toxins that have been absorbed into the whale’s system. Perhaps most importantly, we can test for levels of hormones, which gives us information on the reproductive cycles and stress levels of these creatures as they are increasingly impacted by human activity in their natural habitats. In the “BS” era of data collection (Before Snotbot), the standard way of getting a data sample of a whale (living outside captivity) involved chasing an extremely acoustically sensitive mammal with a loud  motorboat and subsequently shooting it with a sampling dart from a crossbow. Imagine if everything your doctor knew about your health came from chasing you around the room with a large needle while blowing an air-horn.The chart would say something like, “elevated stress levels, prone to shrieking.” It's inaccurate. This is what we believe is going on with some of the current whale data due to the invasive nature of previous sampling methods, and with Snotbot we mean to correct it with a clearer picture of whales that are undisturbed. By using Snotbots, the whale never knows the data is being collected. The custom-built drones fly well above the surface of the water and into the blow, the subjects are never touched or approached closely. Ideally, whale researchers should be positioned about half a mile away from their subjects, giving the whales plenty of room to go about their business. Dozens of technological hurdles had to be overcome in order to make the drones capable of collecting a physical sample at this distance in an uncontrolled marine environment. We crashed a lot of drones in the process (some even on purpose) but wound up with a system we can count on to give us the vital data we need.Snotbot has received some great coverage in popular STEM publications. Aside from a segment on Discovery's Daily Planet show, we have also been featured in Smithsonian Magazine, Gizmodo, the Boston Globe, Geek.com, io9, Popular Science, Daily Dot, and Engadget. The scientific and engineering worlds have taken notice of us, and for good reason. At this point we could spend another year or more mired in what we like to call “The Research Industrial Complex.” We'd be chained to our desks, writing grants, and filling out stacks of paperwork with no guarantee of any success in securing the funds we need to get this project accomplished. But with your help we can start collecting this vital data right away.The way scientists support their research has become collaborative, and we are part of that change. All over the world innovators and researchers are turning to fellow citizens passionate about their subjects to become involved and have access to the results. For those who love whales, the oceans and who believe in minimally invasive research techniques we’re asking you to join up with us. And the best part? When you back our project, you become part of our team. You'll get access to the data we collect in an easy-to-understand report, as well as updates with photos and videos from the field.This Kickstarter supports three expeditions to sites vital to the future survival of whales on our planet. All are locations where Ocean Alliance has significant experience conducting research and where we feel Snotbot will make the greatest impact on our current understanding of these species.Peninsular Valdez Patagonia:
A unique location where land, sea and air come together, to create enormous biodiversity. The barren landscape belies a sea teeming with life: elephant seals, sea lions, fur seals and of course the southern right whale. Ocean Alliance has been studying them there since the 1970's.Sea of Cortez: A prime research site for us since 1985, this region is considered a biological nursery for the Pacific due to the density and variety of oceanic wildlife. Fin, Blue, Humpback and Sperm whales found there at different times of the year. Southeast Alaska / Frederick Sound: Our most enduring research subject the Humpback travels from across the Pacific to Southeast Alaska every summer to feed on the abundance of small fish. The waterway, known as the “Alaska Marine Highway”, is busy with commercial and recreational traffic so any data gathered here will be particularly useful for the health and survival of the species in these waters. Each location is specifically chosen based on the species that frequent the habitat and drawing from the experience of our previous research expeditions.We are hoping to sample some of the same individual whales we’ve been following for the past 45 years.This will allow us to compare the new, non-invasively gathered evidence to well-established data sets from previous missions. This is where we expect Snotbot to prove our hypothesis that the sampling methodology has a noticeable effect on results, potentially altering our view of these creatures and their stressors.We like to say we're the most significant marine research group you've never heard of. But publicity or no, we've spent the past 44 years using the latest technology to better understand our oceans. In 1967 our founder Roger Payne used underwater microphones to first discover whale sing songs, featured in National Geographic Magazine. You may have seen the album ""Songs of the Humpback Whale"" - that recording is on the Voyager spacecraft as a greeting to other civilizations from the inhabitants of Earth! We partnered with leading research organizations worldwide, collecting the first ever global expedition to establish a baseline data set on ocean pollution, covered by PBS. Recently we've wrapped up another five years of toxicology research in the Gulf of Mexico documenting the effects of the BP oil disaster. All in all, we've been involved in the production of over 40 documentaries studying whales,We have some really cool rewards for backing our project.  For instance, our basic whale adoption kits, and 'Whales' IMAX DVDs that are narrated by Patrick Stewart. Some are even signed by the man himself! And it's key to note every donation to our Kickstarter is tax deductible in the U.S.(minus the value of the merchandise)All pledges to the Snotbot project are tax deductible, minus the fair market value of the reward it contains! We're unable to change the rewards to add this information, but keep that in mind when you're pledging - Ocean Alliance is a verified 501(c)3!We consider anyone who donates at any level to be on our team and should display the Snotbot mission logo with pride. Backers at all levels will receive updates from our missions and a user-friendly report including the data sets of our findings.  Here's a mockup of some of the rewards we're offering (may be subject to change and/or modification):Whale art photo suitable for framing:“Most recent efforts at saving whales have been directed at whaling. But whaling has become a relatively minor problem for whales compared to man-made pollutants, plastic trash, military sonars, oil spills and the noises from the air-guns used in oil exploration. It is time to attack these causes of stress and death for whales, their dolphin cousins and many other ocean species. That cannot be done without knowing more about which problems cause the worst effects. The missing link in finding that out has long been the lack of any way to examine the general health of a whale before and after it has faced such insults. Your contributions will help find that missing information—that missing link. You will help to find unarguable evidence about  the effects on ocean life of the problems that humanity is causing. We are after a cure, and accurate diagnosis is the first step to any cure.""The principle goal of Snotbot is not only to collect physical data from whales but also to develop new innovative tools to collect it. Sir Patrick happily volunteered to be harassed in order to help tell the story in support of this endeavor. Sir Patrick is a longtime supporter and trustee of Ocean Alliance – even traveling on our research vessel the Odyssey. We can’t thank him enough for his participation in this project. His new series, Blunt Talk, is premiering on August 22nd on Starz. You should watch it, it looks hysterical.

If I have to purchase an iPad to program CodeyBot, I will.  But, since this will be an additional expense, I'll be looking to minimize the cost by buying an older iPad.  Does mBlockly run on every version of the iPad?  Thanks.~Dear Makeblock:  I received my Codeybots, and they are working great!  These are awesome robots. I backed your KS because you promised full Android support for the Codeybot.  When will mBlockly be available on Android?  Thanks!~I have not received it yet, any help?~hi i havent receive my order yet~Wow!  Very very fast production, moving from completed Kickstarter project to fulfillment in only 3 months, exactly as you predicted.  Thank you!  You guys have been excellent with 3 of the projects I've pledged towards.~I had received Codeybot at Today.Taiwan customer to claimed  me of NTD169 TAX. This is for Taiwan fans reference.Thanks.~I just got mine today, and it's great so far! The only thing that hasn't worked for me is voice control. How do I get that to work? I tried pressing on the little microphone button in the app, but it almost immediately switches to a red X in a circle.~Hi, I also got my Codeybots last week, but DHL also demanded 74Euros Import Duty Tax. I surely wasn't expecting this and it's quite a lot of money. I love the robots, but is there a way you will refund the Import Duty? I heard some kickstarter projects actually do this.~@Imran, I was able to get it on my wifi, but one mistake and your codeybot could be toast.  The codeybot app however did not appear to find it on my own Wi-Fi.~@J Dubrow It is possible like in those wifi hard drives. They create their own wifi network but you can also connect to your own wifi connection through it. Useful for drive firmware updates.~Anyway to have the codeybot on our normal wifi so we don't have to keep switching our WIFI and cutting off our devices from the internet to use it?~Please tell me when will you ship mine ???!!!!~When do shipments start for the US?  Thank you!~Hello,~I received mine last week and my son and I have been having a blast with it! I am looking forward to updates with more options in the MakeBlock app! ~Makeblock,~Hi, when will you ship mine? I am so disappointed.~Got mine. But, very disapointed by the lack of dev tools on android/windows. Supposed to be open, no ?~We're still waiting for our codeybot~Received my Codeybots a couple of weeks ago, still looking for android compatibility. Got it to work with my iPad though, but when I hit dance is it supposed to just sit there and play music? My Codeybot does not stand upright at all despite all of the views showing it does...is something wrong with it?~Just curious as to when I'll be receiving my Codeybots. My credit card was charged back during the Kickstarter project but since then I have had no communication from you.~Just received my Codeybot in the Taiwan, very nice; thanks!~Just received my items.~Thank you for taking the feedback into consideration. Looking forward to hearing some good news for Android users.Also, I received my Codeybots. Excellent packing, very impressed. Didn't get any shipping notification. Its been a while since I received a Kickstarter product on time so Kudos for that. Seems like a solid/polished product.Good luck for the future.~Just got mine and it is a great Bot. Thanks~I got a Fedex delivery from KWAI CHUNG HK. Is it from your company?~When can I get mine? Does there any way to track it?~I got mine on Thursday, very cool. My kids love programming it with the mBlockly app.~Hello, DHL are demanding £27 import duty before they will deliver in the UK. There was no mention that this would be required so I will not be paying it and the codeybot will be sent back. Could you cover the duty or refund my money please.~Till now. No any info about shipping. Please check my status.~Got mine yesterday here in PA. Awesome!~Is there any possibility of using the Windows or Mac desktop version of mBlock ( http://www.mblock.cc/ ) to develop a program, and then send it to Codeybot somehow?~Looks like the codeybot uses openwrt and some python scripts.  Root is the username with no password.  It also seems to use UDP on 1183 and has a variety of commands it accepts.G# param1..paramNI haven't compiled a list, or really confirmed this, but that is what I've seen in my 20 minutes of looking around.~Re. Android programming capability - add us to the ""sorely disappointed"" contingent.  We were planning to purchase additional units to do some coordinated programming projects, but if programming via Android is not possible (and ""full Android implementation"" was promised earlier in the ""stretch goal"" text), then we will not be purchasing any further units nor add-ons.  I'm hoping that this is merely a glitch in logistics and that you've just been too busy as yet.  Please address the community of backers regarding this issue so we can know what is really going on and stop any further speculation.  Thanks.~If you won't make an mBlocky app, please open the API so others may.~I second @Chris Imershein's comments.  I was going to buy a second one and a two battle kits, but I think I'll pass and sell mine to someone who can use it if there won't be a mBlocky for Android in the very near future.  Very disappointing.~I didn't receive call or tracking # my Codeybots just appeared. I have an answering machine so didn't get a message either. What's up with your website www.codeybot.com?  Should of had that going before they shipped. Are they any other sites working with info on the Codeybot?~I found the app, but it only works on iPad. great! Now I need to get an iPad. You guys are some special kind of geniuses.~I am extremely disappointed to learn that the mBlocky app that is required to ""program"" Codeybot is not available for Android.~I got mine today. I can't find mBlocky on app store.Do you have a link?~Hi,  just received my Codeybots today, i want use it with scratch as i do with mbot what i must to do ?? Is there a plugin to install on scratch...?? The website www.codeybot.com is expired so i can't download sw from it.... plase help me..!!~Hi, just received my Codeybots today, so thanks for that.

109," Just over two years ago, out of a garage in Redondo Beach, California, we launched a Kickstarter campaign for an innovative underwater thruster - the T100. Thanks to over 350 awesome backers, that project became a reality and Blue Robotics was born.Since then, we've put everything we've got into designing the most innovative and accessible components and systems for marine robotics. We've reached thousands of people around the world, supported hundreds of schools and research projects, and launched our own complete vehicle, the BlueROV2.As a company, we always strive to be open and transparent, putting our customers first and sharing as much information as we can about our products. With the Make/100 Edition Thruster, we're taking that transparency to a new, literal, level. The Make/100 Edition Thruster is a completely clear version of the T200 Thruster, perfect for showing off to curious minds, learning about engineering and design, and for making some unique looking underwater projects! We will only ever make 100 sets of these thrusters and this campaign is limited to 100 backers! In our continuing effort to support STEM programs and the overall education of marine robotics, as part of this campaign we'll be donating 50 thrusters (not clear ones) to the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center to be distributed to schools that are in need of financial support for their programs.The thruster was originally launched in 2014 through a Kickstarter campaign and supported by Proto Labs through the Cool Idea! Award.Our mission has always revolved around education and learning. Our products, including thrusters, support hundreds of STEM programs, MATE ROV competition teams, and more. Beyond educational programs, it's really important to us that all of our users and fans can understand how our products work so they can take full advantage of them. We strive to make our product designs easy to use and flexible enough to promote creative uses. Here are just a handful of projects using the T200 Thruster.We love talking to those who use our thrusters and we often visit schools, competitions, and trade shows to meet those people first-hand. We always get asked, ""how do the thrusters work?"" and ""what's inside?"" - we've always thought that a clear thruster would be an awesome tool to answer those questions. So, when were invited by Kickstarter to participate in the Make/100 initiative, we knew exactly what we wanted to do!Whether you're a student, educator, hobbyist, or just a marine robotics enthusiast, the Make/100 Edition thruster is a unique tool for your next project.We owe our initial success to the ""kickstart"" that we got on Kickstarter - it was the start of an incredible journey. Things have changed a lot since then! We've moved twice, grown our team, and launched many new products.We're back on Kickstarter to raise the funding to make this project happen. Hopefully we're not the only ones excited about clear thrusters! The funding goal is set at $5,000 to cover the set-up costs and minimum order quantities required to make a batch of clear parts.We're thrilled to be on Kickstarter again with a really cool and fun project! We hope that you'll join us as one of our 100 backers on this campaign.The T200 thruster is basically a brushless electric motor, just like you’d find on an RC airplane or a quadcopter drone. But, it's purpose-built for use in the ocean and was designed specifically for use on marine robotic vehicles of all sorts. We've had customers use them on everything from ROVs to stand-up-paddle boards!The T200 is made of high-strength, UV resistant polycarbonate plastic. The core of the motor is sealed with a protective coating and it uses high-performance plastic bushings in place of steel bearings that rust in saltwater. Everything that isn’t plastic is high-quality 316 stainless steel that doesn’t corrode.A specially designed propeller and nozzle provides efficient, powerful thrust while active water-cooling keeps the motor cool. Water flows freely through all parts of the motor while it's running. That means it can go deep in the ocean and handle extreme pressures.Key FeaturesPerformanceElectricalPhysicalFor all details, check out the T200 Thruster documentation page.Each backer will receive two clear Make/100 Limited Edition T200 Thrusters. We will ship all of the thrusters by the beginning of March.  As part of the campaign, 50 T100 thrusters will be donated to middle school and high school robotics teams through the MATE Center. To learn more about our mission, check out the video below! Thanks for visiting our campaign!

It simplifies lives by making smart homes safer, more comfortable, more accessible, and more efficient.  Momo offers many functions in one, allowing you to replace security systems, smart home hubs, and many other home systems with one elegant device - no complicated installation required.  ​Momo beat out products from Philips, Samsung, and many other huge IoT brands to win the Silicio IoT Award in 2016 .    Home Security - Momo is packed with standalone security features like motion detection, facial recognition, and intelligent sound detection, and can also work with any additional security systems around the home. It will even equip connected cameras with motion detection and facial recognition.Smart Home Super Hub - Thanks to a full suite of connectivity systems and an open architecture, Momo can automatically sync with and manage nearly all smart home devices, including standard appliances plugged into smart plugs. Learn & Adopt Intelligence - Momo employs machine learning techniques to learn user habits and environmental preferences, and suggest automations for your home to perfectly fit your life.    Momo isn't just a hub - it's a fully featured smart home robot, that learns and adapts to the requirements of your home life.  Whether you want to manage every action in your smart home, or let Momo effortlessly automate your home life, we've equipped it with all the features you will ever need:  Momo's AI frees you from time consuming home management by automating your home, giving you more time to do the things you love. Momo's smart home management can lead to impressive energy savings, keep your home safe, and help you to build the perfect smart home experience.   Momo offers 24/7, intelligent and self-learning standalone security, in addition to full compatibility with all smart security sensors - it will even apply its intelligence, facial recognition, and motion detection to connected cameras.   Thanks to Momo's revolutionary AI capabilities, it can automatically arm your security when you are asleep or away from the home, provide live feeds of abnormal events detected, and even connect you with users in the home in the case of an emergency.   Momo is equipped with a 360° night vision camera, facial recognition, motion detection, intelligent sound detection and more, to provide a 24/7 standalone home security solution.  Momo's artificial intelligence extends to a full suite of standalone security features. It can automatically activate these features when you leave the home, or when your family is asleep. Sensors include light, sound, smoke and air quality, motion detection, and intelligent sound detection.Momo will learn the layout of the space it is in, along with the faces and patterns of all residents and friends, provided they are ""introduced"" by a resident. With it's rotating night vision camera, you can stream live video and keep an eye on the home when away. Momo will deliver auditory, light, and app alerts whenever strange motion, abnormal sounds, or changes in air quality alert it to something wrong in the home. Intelligent sound detection can tell the difference between normal home noises and sounds like a cry for help or breaking glass.   Momo's intelligence extends to connected security systems in the home, acting as a hub for conveniently controlling them all at once and making them smarter through its own AI features. Momo connects to wireless door or window sensors, moisture sensors, and additional security cameras, using them to recognize who is there and when they are moving. View all video feeds for connected cameras right from the Momo Home app. You can even keep track of the health of loved ones wearing smart bands.The Momo Home app lets you view and manage all these devices, or you can let Momo manage them automatically, and alert you to any issues.  Whether it's an emergency or you just want to check in on your loved ones, Momo allows wireless two-way video and audio communication.When it is connected to WiFi, Momo allows you to make and receive video calls through any connected AV device, like a smart TV, Computer, or mobile phone. You can also make WiFi voice calls using Momo's speaker and microphone.Momo allows a wide variety of remote functions, like remote activation of devices in Momo's network. For example, you might want to turn on lights or music in the home to simulate a presence while you are away.  Your privacy is incredibly important - that's why Momo uses 128-bit encryption running on proven software, thanks to our partnership with Microsoft.  In addition to encrypting all data that goes through Momo, you can choose to manually lock Momo's camera and microphone by rotating the shade to physically block them and set Momo in the security lock position. Momo does not retrieve, store or share any personal data, and prioritizes in-house users' privacy over remote access requests. momo is cloudless, and does not require the internet to function within the home. All your data is safely stored on its internal memory.  Momo is the ultimate smart home hub, coordinating all your smart home devices and allowing for a fully autonomous, managed experience.   No other smart home hub offers the same artificially intelligent learning that Momo does. Manage all your devices through Momo manually, or let Momo do all the work; the choice is yours.   Momo can detect other smart home devices automatically - setting it up couldn't be simpler.  Once you have downloaded the Momo app, you can make a profile, set your password, and add any additional users. Momo takes it from there - it will automaticaly detect devices it can connect to, and ask if you would like to add them to Momo's network.  Momo runs on an open platform, and is the first smart home device that can work with all your other devices without losing any functionality.With Momo, the possibilities are endless. It will work with natural language virtual assistants like Google Home and Amazon Alexa. Whether you use the native apps for connected devices or the Momo Home app, you will not lose any functionality, and Momo will continue to learn your patterns and preferences.  Stream your favorite web radio to connected Bluetooth speakers, set the thermostat to your perfect temperature, adjust the lighting - Momo will let you control any system with wireless connectivity. You can even connect to traditional appliances by plugging them into smart plugs and letting Momo know what appliance is connected. No more leaving the oven on - Momo will alert you if an appliance has been left on in an empty home.  Most smart home devices are ugly plastic boxes, marring the aesthetic of your home. Momo is designed by a professional lighting design studio in Italy as a beautiful and functional lamp, with style that will stand the test of time.  Momo is discrete, and will blend into any room in the home while adding mood lighting you can fully customize. Use gesture control to brighten or dim the lamp, or change through the four modes: Study, Relax, Night, and Living. Momo will illuminate automatically when you enter the room, and can change its brightness based on ambient light. It will even light up if the power goes out, thanks to a backup battery.   Create pre-set modes for different scenarios: if you're having dinner with friends, you can tell Momo to automatically set a soft light, raise the thermostat to 72°F, and play your favorite music.  Interact with Momo however you want, as much or as little as you would like.  With Momo, your level of control is entirely up to you - and all automation goes through you. You can control Momo and connected devices via voice commands or the Momo Home app. You can chat with Momo via Telegram, Facebook Messenger, or Skype. Control Momo's lamp with gesture control, and receive alerts from the LEDs, on your mobile phone, or through Momo's speaker.Momo can fully autonomously develop and suggest automations for your home, or you can choose to set up your preferred sets of actions manually.  Momo uses machine learning techniques to learn your patterns of device use and behavior in the home, and suggest automations to make your life easier.   Momo's Learn & Adopt intelligence will help you create the perfect home environment without having to spend hours managing your devices.   Momo's artificial intelligence allows it to learn your patterns of smart home device usage and behavior, and suggest sets of actions for you to adopt.  We call it Learn & Adopt Intelligence. Say you get home from the office every day at 6:30. You turn on the lights, set the thermostat, play some music, and deactivate your home security. Momo can suggest this set of activities to all happen automatically when you get home each work day. It's your choice how to implement the automation: Now, Always, or not at all. When you leave the home, Momo can activate security, turn off the lights or turn off connected domestic appliances that have accidentally been left on, detect open doors and windows, and actively keep an eye on the house. Momo will even learn if you prefer to change a connected device's settings through that device's control panel, the Momo Home app, or to let Momo handle it automatically.Momo's AI is based on machine learning teachniques, giving it a level of self-awareness. It can learn users' household habits, recognize its surroundings, and acknowledge specific events. Importantly, the user always has final say on any automation adopted, and can set combinations of devices and activities to automate manually if so desired.  Momo is designed to make your life easier, safer, and more comfortable.  Because Momo can coordinate multiple features and services in the home, it is able to maximize the benefit you get from each of those systems. You can come back to a home that's set to the perfect temperature and light level, without worrying that you've left your lights or heat on all day.  Momo requires minimal interaction, and no special installation or configuration. Interact with Momo as much or as little as you want - you'll be able to benefit from the same perfect smart home experience either way. Momo saves you time, energy and money, and lets you focus on the things that matter.  Momo is constantly learning, and will adapt to changing environments and situations. Momo will analyze its environment, and adapt to any changes it detects. It can turn on the lights when you enter the room, activate security when you leave the house, and alert you to any appliances that have been left on. It will suggest different sets of automation for the weekend, when your hours at home are different. It can adapt to being moved to a new location in the home, changing any settings and working with different devices. It will even suggest changes to automations you have adopted if your habits change.   Momo is the ideal home companion for discerning home owners everywhere. Whether you are concerned with security, home management, energy efficiency, or personal safety and health, Momo has the features you need.    Momo's standalone security features and networking capabilites allow it to fully protect your home, worry-free.Say you've just left the home. Momo will activate security mode, and alert you to any windows or doors equipped with sensors that have been left open. If you choose, it will generate a mock presence in the house by turning lights and music on or off periodically.  If Momo detects something suspicious, such as an unknown presence or strange sound, it will send an alert to the user, sound an alarm, and can even turn on its light and any connected lighting. Stream video through the mobile app to see what triggered Momo.When you return home and Momo recognizes you, it will deactivate security mode.  Momo comes equipped with a variety of sensors designed to maintain a healthy home environment. If momo detects unsafe levels of gas or other pollutants, poor air quality, crying or a call for asistance, it will send an alert, flash, and sound an alarm. Users will be able to see exact readings in the Momo Home app, stream video of the home through Momo's night vision camera, and communicate through Momo's speaker and microphones.   Momo can coordinate your favorite devices and services to create the perfect home environment. Momo will set up your home just how you like it - whether you're coming home from work, inviting friends over for dinner, or leaving for vacation. Sets of actions can be assigned to each of these scenarios. You also manually tell Momo to do things - for example, turning on your coffee maker and radio in the morning.   Momo can differentiate between members of the household - it can create different sets of automations to activate for each user that enters the room or the home.  Save on your energy bills by leaving device management to Momo.  Momo will learn the time when users are going to bed, and suggest energy-saving automations for night mode. For example, turning off the lights in the rest of the house, lowering the heat, and turning off any appliances plugged into smart plugs that have been left on. Similarly, it can make sure lights, heating, and appliances are not left one when all users have left the home. Once our campaign reaches $60,000, we will unlock our free More Power package. All Momos will be upgraded to an advanced Quad Core processor, 2GB of ram, a double-sized 32 GB HDD, and a larger back-up battery pack. This will make Momo work faster, letting its algorithms, facial recognition, motion detection and more work at peak capacity.      We’ve participated in conventions and fairs throughout the lifetime of the Momo project, and gotten some great feedback on Momo. Check out these missives below on what makes Momo great. We interviewed Sumit Dhanuka - VP & Lead - Private Investments at SAR Group Family Office, based in Gurgaon, Haryana, India - at SMAU Milan 2016. In this video, he describes his impressions of Momo.  Ray Garcia is an entrepreneur with over twenty years of global experience in creating business value with innovative information technology products. Here he talks about the MOMO project by Morpheos.     Thanks to Momo's open platform OS, it offers broad inter-operability, and can connect to devices using a wide variety of industry standards. It will work with devices on closed systems, like Philips lights, without forgoing built in features other hubs do not support. It can connect to closed systems via their API libraries, and will track your use habits whether you interact with your smart devices via the Momo Home app or the device's native app. It can even work independently of an internet connection.         ",Morpheos Team,"$54,446",Unstated,"Momo is a smart home robot, equipped with artificial intelligence, and designed as a super hub with standalone security features.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,210 ," Thanks - as I have high expectations for Momo's performance - I have a similar high view of how the design and management for those task with bringing Momo into existence. So far - excellence (minus the current delay) is what we (backers) have received.  This next communication I think is critical - I suspected that getting Momo to us before Xmas will be difficult BUT ... I am inclined to believe it can be done.~It's been nearly a month since your last update - I'd like to know how testing went and where MOMO is regarding delivery...~Thanks for the response - Each time you restate how MOMO will ""learn"" and ""Adopt"" new ways for it to better serve my needs for a hub  - my excitement level rises. I'm just giddy with expectations to receive and watch MOMO fix the ragged edges of my smart home collection odds and ends into a functioning and learning environment...~@creator, the question made by levy is one that I asked before and you could not yet answer. (Integration with Google home/assistant). ~Thanks for the response - I think Flare and Momo would be a bit much - I thought is that Momo is far superior to Flare - One the points you did not make was the community you've assembled using the KS platform and the design/fashion aspect of Momo. It is curious that neither device wants to be integrated with other platforms like Google, Amazon or who have you... Which raises the question - If I use Alexa or Google Home to manage my lights - will Momo replace them in the control or direct them to engage the control?~This morning I read about a product that sounds like MOMO but it's not!  ~To follow on from Levy. The longer term implications of both MOMO and the IOT are in their infancy. It seems slightly daft that I've gone from switching lights off, to asking Alexa and then on to having them be automated inside a year. Having said that I think Amazon proved a point. None of their new range would make me upgrade. Just not quite a big enough leap. I think if MOMO is smart enough (and has an internet connection) then the techno creep we see in cellphones will be unnecessary.~I get  you have and continue to but much effort into Momo - but my question was more about what's next - after Momo is in our hands - will there be a place for us early adopters to continue our engagement with you or not.  I continue to be impressed with your efforts and tone for communication with us -  I'm hoping it continues and grows over time.~I listen to an interview where one of your people talk about the differences between the USA market and the Italian - That you would not be opening the Italian market until next year - Should we who are receiving the current MOMO consider ourselves Beta Testers?  In the same interview he discussed the arc of the products you intend to introduce - Like what and when, will us Beta Testers have a continued roll - like a forum or slack channel?~10/2 - where are we on the path to delivery - this month?~Oh-Oh. Details are scarce but I think Amazon just double-downed on you - the new Echo-Plus would seems to be threatening to steal your thunder! Come on Team MoMo!~Good answer - you're quick at understanding what I'm asking - will the Alexa and ifttt services be available when we receive momo or ota shortly after...~Will we be able to link momo's light along into a room's lighting scene - color - mood and the like? When we tell Alexa that we want the lights in the room with Momo to go into ""Party"" how will or could momo react?~How are we looking on the Oct. delivery date?~While you are answering my question about blubs - how about the camera that would fit best with Momo?  I'm making these request in anticipation of Momo's being delivered in Oct - am I being to optimistic?~Which blubs best communicates with momo~Ilumi uses bluetooth LTE 4.2 (mesh) to communicate to and between its bulbs - using them requires a phone (android within 10 ft or so) to function.  Will I be able to use Momo to communicate instructions to these bulbs, given it is placed within the range of the bulbs?~I've learned couple things from just following your answers - the security camera needs to be connected to wifi network that momo is - the placement of momo is strategic and important. I am even more impressed as the time nears towards its delivery.~He creator,~It's been awhile - what's up - hope you and the team are refreshed and have something exciting to tell us about MOMO - like it has reached the level of funding for the extra processing and memory?~Interesting post on Wake Words. I backed a smart alarm clock on KS a while ago and warned the (French) development team that using ""Bonjour"" would probably trip some folks up - they asssured me it would be fine - but what did their last update say? On a similar note my wife now knows that ""Echo"" gets much better results than ""oi!

112," AJAX (Amplified Juggernaut Assistance Exoskeleton) is a full body exosuit designed to allow its user to lift and carry 400 pounds effortlessly. The goal is to have it entirely controlled by the wearer so that it responds naturally to the user’s arm and leg movements. We plan to debut the project at May 2015 Bay Area Maker Faire. This is our most ambitious Maker Faire project yet. For more information, pictures, and weekly updates, please visit exosuit.org. Our team consists of eight high school students from the Bay School of San Francisco working in conjunction with a few adult mentors and the Young Makers program for resources and guidance. We've never made anything quite like this before and have been enjoying this challenge. We hope to not only learn and grow as engineers from this experience, but also to inspire other people our age to take up projects of their own.Members of our team have been exhibiting at Maker Faire for years, including projects such as Saphira, an animatronic fire breathing dragon, The Viper, a Battlestar Galactica themed flight simulator, and the Potato Gatling Gun. A list of all previous Maker Faire projects can be found here.The AJAX exosuit detects its user’s movements with force sensors on their upper arms, forearms, thighs and lower legs and sends a signal to the on board Arduinos. The information is then processed and sent to the pneumatic pistons located at each joint. The pistons then push the suit’s limbs, allowing the suit to mirror its user’s movements. This means the AJAX exosuit can respond automatically to its wearer's actions and act as extra support and strength for heavy lifting.We've been talking about making an exosuit for years, but have always been worried about safety. However, seeing movies like Iron Man and Robocop got us excited enough about the concept to assemble a team and finally start working on it.For more, check out our weekly progress updates on exosuit.org/exosuit-progress.You can find additional pictures here.All contributions will be used to cover the cost of materials and Kickstarter rewards. Here's a more in-depth breakdown of estimated costs:We've secured approximately $6500 in corporate sponsorships so far (thank you Autodesk and Cliparrd!), so we are seeking an additional $2500 from Kickstarter to help defray most of the remaining costs.Any contributions in excess of actual expenses will be donated to our fiscal sponsor, The Maker Education Initiative, that supports creating making opportunities for kids and families.",The Exosuit Team,"$7,263",Unstated,"High school kids are building a powered exoskeleton.

113," The Spirit Rover is the next big step in advanced robots for learning, teaching, and all around hacking fun. The robot is outfitted with up to three different computing processors, built with high quality components, and fit into an iconic form factor that any tech nerd can appreciate!Spirit is a perfect starting point for students and hobbyists looking for an expandable and full featured robot platform. Whether you're new to coding or involved in serious robotics research, the Spirit Rover has something for you.  Want to learn to code in Python and/or Arduino? Whether you're new to programming or a pro, the capabilities of the Spirit Rover hardware will allow you to grow and apply your skills. Many combinations of programming are possible. Write your code using Python and C/C++ on the Raspberry Pi, or write your code in C/C++ using the free and open source Arduino environment. Our easy to use functions allow seamless communication between the two boards.
You'll learn how to use advanced features of the powerful Linux operating system. Compile your own code, install packages, view hardware information and more.The Spirit Rover robot includes three different computers, just like many other advanced robots you'll find in the real world. You'll learn how these more advanced systems really work at the low level.A Raspberry Pi computer will handle most of your processing. Though it is optional, it is a powerful computer capable of doing many things at one time. The Pi is similar to the computer inside a tablet computer or small laptop.An Arduino compatible processor can be used alone or together with the Pi. This is the same processor as found on the popular Arduino UNO board. It is also the same processor (and runs the same code!) as the processor on our Ringo, Wink, and Plumduino boards.A Microchip PIC processor handles the low level processing on the robot. It does things like sending pulse signals to the servos, reading light sensors, and managing the power system. It is pre-loaded with code. Normally you won't play with this code on your own, but it is still open and hackable if you want to customize it.The Spirit Rover robot was designed to be the ultimate robot for teaching, learning, hacking, and research. Spirit is perfect for those just getting started in programming all way through to serious swarming and robotic automation research.The Spirit Rover combines the two most popular code learning environments: the Raspberry Pi, and the Arduino. We've assembled them together into a single, high quality platform that is easily usable and endlessly hackable.Start with simple tasks like reading a light sensor and changing the color of a light, then progress into more advanced topics. You will learn how robots use inertial navigation to find their way around, and computer vision to identify objects and obstacles. You'll also learn the basic electronics and communication methods the individual parts robots use to talk to each other. Learn the inner workings of the Linux operating system and how to write your own code in Python and C/C++ languages along the way. The Spirit Rover is packed with personality! It includes 27 RGB ""NeoPixel"" style LED lights that can be individually set to any color or brightness you like. This includes light up ""eyes"" (which are actually the send/receive elements of an ultrasonic rangefinder), 12 pixels down each wing, and one pixel on the mainboard that can be used to indicate status or anything else you like.Using the Raspberry Pi camera, you can begin to learn how computer vision works! You've probably seen examples of this, and it sounds like it would be really complicated. It's actually rather easy to understand.The Spirit Rover is built using high quality components. The pan/tilt head assembly, motor mounts, servo mounts, and connecting hardware are stamped metal parts for maximum durability. The plastic frame parts are made from semi-flexible ABS plastic. This plastic is not brittle and will not easily crack. The rover is designed for best operation to run on smooth surfaces like floors and desktops, though it can still move effectively over more rough surfaces like low pile carpeting.The Spirit Rover includes a gripper servo that works well for dragging small objects around the work area. The gripper and object can be seen through Spirit's camera.The Spirit Rover includes a 3-axis Accelerometer and a 3-axis Gyroscope. These sensors can be used to sense rotation and movement in all directions. This allows the robot to perform ""inertial navigation"" to move specific distances and make precise turns.These are the exact same sensors as used on our Ringo robot, and the functions and code to control them are identical.The Spirit Rover has many different wireless options that can be combined in various ways.   People interested in doing research for swarming behaviors, factory automation, and mesh networking can use the XBee socket to attach any of the range of XBee modules to the robot. These modules allow for long range networking between the robots. We included a socket for this module after talking to researchers who ran into limitations attempting to run multiple robots using other protocols like Bluetooth. WiFi is a good solution but does require a bit of work to join networks and the range of WiFi can be limiting in some situations especially in congested WiFi environments.You can connect a monitor, audio, as well as USB devices and use the internal Raspberry Pi just like a stand along Pi on your desk.The Spirit Rover is shipped as a kit you will assemble yourself with basic hand tools. We will populate all the electronic parts on the boards so no soldering is necessary. Assembly hardware and parts are included.The assembly instructions include CAD drawings for a clear step by step process. As a kid I built lots of R/C cars and the build process was just as much fun as actually playing with them.If you require a special combination of items contact us via message and we'll try to make it happen for you!The Spirit Rover is loaded with useful sensors and processing, sure to keep your projects fresh and evolving for years to come. The heart of the rover is the Rover Main Board which connects to an optional Raspberry Pi computer board.Have a look over the graphics below to see and appreciate all the smarts and awesomeness packed into the robot. The Spirit Rover can be configured in several different ways to maximize the possible applications for the robot. Usually the robot will be configured complete with the Pan/Tilt head in place, though this head can be easily left off and the ultrasonic rangefinder relocated to the front of the rover's frame.Because the Spirit Rover is so well suited to different tasks, we've provided an optional top plate design that can you can 3D print yourself. The open source files can be edited as necessary and the final top plate can be installed using the tabs normally used to mount the wings.The Spirit Rover was designed for maximum flexibility for people to easily hack and make use of all sensors and smarts however they like. Users will generally use a Raspberry Pi to communicate with the Arduino based processor on the rover's main board using a set of simple and easy to use functions we have provided. The Arduino then in turn communicates automatically with a Microchip PIC processor which runs constantly in the background managing the low level hardware, doing things like setting the servo positions, measuring the ultrasonic rangefinder, measuring how much current the robot is consuming, etc.A detailed block diagram more clearly shows the key sensors and smarts of the Spirit rover and how they are inner connected. On June 10, 2003, the Mars Exploration Rover ""Spirit"" lifted off from Earth. About seven months later on January 4, 2004, it landed on the martian surface - bouncing inside a cluster of huge beach balls.Spirit had a sister rover named ""Opportunity"", which arrived to Mars on a separate rocket 21 days later. Though the rovers were only designed to run for 90 days, they both far surpassed this goal. Opportunity is still alive and well on the martian surface over 12 years later! But the story wasn't so rosy for Spirit. After completing it's planned 90 day mission, Spirit ran into several challenges. It suffered a failed wheel which it dragged across the surface while moving, became stuck and un-stuck a few times, and kept the flight crew up late at night with other issues.On May 1, 2009, over five years into it's mission, Spirit became stuck in soft soil . Though the flight crew on Earth tried for nearly eight months to find a way Spirit could free itself, it wasn't to be. The rover continued to communicate with Earth for another few months, working as a stationary observation platform. But on March 22, 2010, communication with Spirit was lost, and Spirit was never heard from again.This project is in honor of the Spirit rover and the extraordinary people at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) who design and pilot the rovers. By making this project possible, you will allow the 'spirit' of Spirit to live on - inspiring and educating the Makers, students, and hobbiests that will go on to design and program the rovers of the future.This project is not affiliated in any way with, or officially endorsed in any way by NASA, JPL, or any agency relating the the rover missions. I'm just a Maker and overall space nerd. The Mars rovers are some of the coolest robots ever designed. I've wanted to design, build, and pilot my own ever since I watched the real mission play out on live television. By supporting this project, you can have your own rover as well! An animation produced by Dan Maas of Maas Digital for Cornell in 2002 showing the launch and landing sequence of the Mars Exploration Rovers. https://www.maasdigital.com/",Plum Geek,"$171,403",Unstated,"Design your own rover missions!

It is the nature of this setup.  The drive motors are only geared DC motors with no feedback to control for position. Being only simple DC motors when you are putting the same power to each motor they have a high likely hood of turning at slightly different rates. This can be somewhat corrected in software by applying a different (lower) power level to the faster motor to slow it down a bit.~So today me and my daughter put it together, and when the glue finally dried she took it for a spin with the default program. But I noticed that it does not go in a straight line. I'm not sure if it is supposed to, but it pulls to the right when I think it should be going in a straight line.~I’m 438. Not heard anything about shipping detail.~same herebacker 634 an update on shipping to australia?~Sorry, should have mentioned that I am 537 ..~Hi ... I pledged for the Spirit/Opportunity Fully Loaded option, can I get a shipping status on that please and thanks.~Hey, I was backer 84 and haven't heard anything yet, can I get some feedback here?~Our first student Rover is operational.  Yay!  Thank you very much.~Got it yesterday, very excited! Planning on building it together with my daughter this weekend.~I'm still waiting the Spirit Rover - My ID: 177~Awesome, thanks Thomas and Plum Geek for the update!~Daniel V.,  From the last update it looks like it was only Nona and Kevin working on fulfilling backer pledges. Kevin was also having to test each board individually with one test fixture which I am guessing takes 1/2 hour. He then loads the demo program into each one and test some more. Another twenty minutes. Put all the parts in a box with a shipping label puts it around 1 hour a backer pledge. I would guess he is working 10 hour days to keep from burning out. That would be 10 units a day. Lets say he works 5 days and we get 50 units a week. I got mine September 7th so I was the first batch of 50 being backer #17. So at the end of day September 15th should have 100 sent out. At the end of September 22nd should have 150 sent out and the end of September 29th around 200 sent out. End of October 6th around 250, end of October 13th would be around 300. That should cover the Fully loaded Early bird pledges. I am guessing at this time line just from the last update and the delivery of my unit. I am thinking the end of October for the shipping of all units..~Hi Plum Geek,How is shipping coming along? About how many robots are going out each week? No rush, just curious. I'm at the very end of the backer line and excited to build this robot (also its the first thing my daughter asks me about every day after school)! Thanks!~Alejandra, I used a set of cheap digital calipers but even a cheaper metric ruler should help.~Hi Alejandra, If you have set of calipers, then a  quick measurement and your done. Otherwise I would open the detailed parts list and match the size to the screw count. That plus the instructions should work. Hope that helps.~Hi guysIn the initial powerup test video, PiUp lights up but in my case it does not. Only pwd and COM. Is that normal ?~Hi! I'm a total beginner building robots and I'm having a hard time knowing what size of the nails to use (for example yesterday I confused the 10mm ones with 6mm ones). Any tips or resources I can use to be able to tell them all apart?~Hi Thomas, No worries, It did not take long to charge. I found the YouTube video on the built-in functions and have already played with it! Very cool.~Jerry, You should be able to test your Spirit rover even before charging it. I was able to play with mine at various times for several days before recharging. The spirit rover does come with some preprogrammed routines that show off some features. Plum Geek has a demo youtube video. https://www.youtube.com/watch…~The rover is charging now! It came in Monday. Spent a couple of hours each day building. Instructions were spot on. On issue I think is on P.20. The caption for the picture does not match the instructions directly below it. Unless I misunderstand stood it. Followed the instructions. No issue.The build went along pretty smoothly. Wish some of the fasteners were a little larger. Only lost 1 tiny screw though! - lolLooks great, can't wait to see it in action.~Thanks Plum Geek. With an overnight charging through the USB connector my Spirit Rover is back to life. Now it awaits new instructions for exploration just like the real Mars rover..~Although I am having fun with my assembled Spirit Rover there is one big important thing missing from the kit. That would be a power supply to recharge the battery. It is not on the bill of materials and not mentioned at all in the manual. Once the battery drains the fun stops. I guess that makes our Spirit Rovers just like the real Mars Spirit Rovers. I do not mind getting a power supply but we really need to know what size (5 volts 2 amps ?) and what plug size (N, M, ??). I am presuming that it would plug in on the main board with the obvious DC type power connector..~Simon, They are shipping. I was fully loaded kit early backer 17 and I just got mine on the 7th. There were 300 fully loaded kit early backers so it is going to take awhile to get those all out. From the last update it appears that it is only Kevin and Nana fulfilling the pledges as their hired help went missing. That will surely slow them down. I am guessing they can ship 50 a week so with 300 early backer full kits and another 155 not so early backer kits it will take some time. Totally worth it. Took me around 6 total hours to build. Looking forward to the educational part of this project but I feel with Kevin's schedule it will be likely early October sometime before that part starts. Give it time.~HelloI havent recieved anything - not even a shipping notice. Is everything okay?Kind regardsSimon~Now that 300 backers are starting to get their Early Bird deliveries it should be pointed out that there is a Forum for discussion.http://forum.plumgeek.com/viewforum.php…~MINE JUST SHIPPED !!!!! Cant wait! So happy but sad as well since my 9 year old daughter was waiting to build it with me but now she immigrated to Canada :(~Built!  Instructions are great.  Part are very small.  I can't believe I didn't loose any screws since I did this over carpet.  Only thing I did wrong with the screws was I used 3 on each wing LED board and ended up short for the eye LED board.  I used a couple SHORT self tapping servo screws for that board since, at the time, I didn't know where the other two screws were.  My ONLY two suggestions at this point are that I think larger screws would have been helpful for the build, the holes for the wing cables should be moved a bit so you can still put the cable through easily with the LED board attached, and I'll bug you again for micro USB ports.  ;-)  THANKS Kevin!  Let me know what your next project is.  I'm sure I'll be there to support it.~The Inventory list seems to be working now for me. Now the fun begins.~First assembly bug. The manual ""Spirit Rover Robot - Parts Inventory"". The link:https://plumgeek.gitbooks.io/spirit-rover-setup-build/content/parts-inventory.htmlwhen clicking on the inventory link that goes to https://drive.google.comit produces.""Error 404"" Not found.~I'm Backer #17 in Indiana and just got my box of Spirit goodies. Looks like it is all there. Now if I can just skip work today so I can play ;)..~Backer #45 here on the East Coast.  Just took delivery of the Rover.  Box full of goodies I now have to find time to assemble :).  Thanks for all of the updates along the way.  One of the more process details, warts and all Kickstarter projects I have backed and I appreciate that very much.~woot.. woot.. So excited.. Just got a shipping notice... Looks like my Spirit will arrive Thursday...,.~The funny symbol on my last comment was supposed to be a smiley face not a question mark! ;-)  That's better.~Backer #7 here - I just got a “shipped” email!! �~Any updates on shipping?~Last chapter 'Gripper'  of the manual at gitbook. Looks like text and or picture is missing.~@Plum Geek. I second that request not to rush. Take your time. You are communicating with us so we know what is happening. If it is going to take you another week then it will take another week. I know we are all patiently waiting but there is no point in killing off the project creator from exhaustion. We all want support later down the road ;).~@Plum Geek. Don't feel the need to rush. I would rather wait a little longer and get the rover when you feel it's ready.~Wahoo, as we all are excited to get our hands on the little rover. I am glad that all is going good now. Some are not as patient as some of us we understand that troubles happen and we just wait and see if help is needed on our side.~*Excited!!!* Can't wait to start building and programming the robot :-)Hope everything will go as planned and we all will have our rovers soon.~Got my survey request so I know it must be close..

114," Introducing the world's first Pancake Printer! We are a group of high school students working on a project that can print pancakes out in shapes drawn by users on a touchscreen. The Pancake Printer started as an idea at lunch in the fall of 2013, and we began working on the project in late 2013. In December of 2014, we finished a fully functioning prototype that was revealed and displayed at a breakfast for our classmates put on by the school's PA. Our classmates were able to draw their pancakes on a touchscreen laptop, and when they pressed Print, the drawing was sent through a program we developed using the Python programming language through a serial port and into the machine's 'brain', which is written in the Spin language. The project in its current state (as shown in the 1st picture and the video) is fully capable of moving with decent precision and drawing the shapes sent to it. (The video shows a testing session where the printer printed ""hi"" in cursive using an expo marker taped to the nozzle rather than real pancake batter. Unfortunately we didn't get any videos of the printer working at the breakfast with real pancake batter.) The problem we now face is making the printer more precise. Right now it is constructed using wood and screws, and this hurts its ability to place the pancake batter onto the griddle beneath with the precision we need. Our plan is to use the funds we earn through Kickstarter to submit the 3D model we are designing (shown in the 2nd picture) for 3D printing so we can construct the final version with the exact dimensions and precision we need to print some pretty awesome pancake designs. We hope you'll support our endeavors! Visit www.thepancakeprinter.tk to see the official website.",Austin and Philip,$630,Unstated,This machine prints pancakes in shapes drawn on a touchscreen.

115," Be ready humans! The Plantoid robots have arisen, ready to conquer wild territories such as mildly cluttered carpet or lawns, and courageously... err safely avoid top-tier predators such as house cats and honey bees.   Concept:Our Plantoids are practical. We actually build plant brained robots (no more abstract models), and approach the educational topics from a mindset of building a model with real hardware and code that results in physical experiments. Your plant-robot cyborg dream can become reality.Sensory Input:The key is using sensors and data to expand and support the survival of the plant specimen on the robot. When you can achieve that, the robot can perform interesting experiments and missions to expand life to new environments--previously devoid of life! Using an Arduino-based sensory suite to provide data on the quality of life of its plant center, a Plantoid can autonomously explore its environment in search of the best location for its own prosperity. Modeling the extension of life can lead to literacy that may inspire new solutions to big problems that we face today: send life to other planets, change food production, or model survival and sustainability in harsh environments. Currently, the sensors included in the Plantoids Base Kit: It can signal states and alarms with an RGB LED and speaker.  MobilityThe robust tread and wheel designs allow for travel over moderately rough indoor and some outdoor terrain, and uses data from the interior of its terrarium brain, housing a small specimen of carnivorous Butterwort plant, or other plant fit for a terrarium environment.Educational AspirationsWith Plantoid Robots, we are bringing new educational activities to homes, classrooms and gardens across the world. Our initial pilot project was held in partnership with our local botanical garden, and it served to change and excite the perspective of what kind of education can be fostered around technology and conservation, while making cool robots in their perfect habitat. That is why we have a specialized Backer level to sponsor and collaborate with botanical and community gardens everywhere. This campaign is for Makers. If you like building things, these robots are a fun exercise in making a cool science project that combines tech and code with biology and bio-mimicry. Our Stretch Goals will expand on the Plantoid ecosystem. When we reach our initial funding goal, we will release our advanced units, the PlantoidX. They are much larger, research-oriented robots featuring upgraded computing with such hardware as Raspberry Pi or single board computer, and use software called MyRobotLab to build a full webserver Advanced sensory functions will expand the Plantoid experience. Users can also tether via our Plantoid smartphone app to control the functions of the robot manually. ",David Ultis,"$5,139",Unstated,Let's make organic plant-robot cyborgs together.

116," Formula Pi is an exciting new race series and club designed to get people started with self-driving robotics. The aim is to give people with little hardware or software experience a platform to get started and learn how autonomous vehicles work. We provide the hardware and basic software to join the race series. Competitors can modify the software however they like, and come race day a prepared SD card with your software on it will be placed into our club robots and the race will begin!You don't need to be in the UK, you can enter the series from anywhere in the world. Just join and send code to compete!The SeriesThe series will consist of races hosted here at PiBorg. The races will be live broadcast for everyone to watch online. Races will consist of up to 23 laps (approximately 1/2km) with 5 competitors per race. The robots will be provided by PiBorg for racing.Grid position, competitor list and club robot assignments are assigned with a random shuffle script. Each competitor will be involved in a minimum of 5 races. We will have a complete structure once we know how many competitors are involved.Anticipated race datesAlthough these dates may change (especially due to amount of entries), we expect the following:Winter series - 
	from October 2016 - January 2017Summer series -
	from April 2017 - July 2017The TrackThe track was designed and built at the PiBorg offices. The 22.9m track has 5 corners and can be run in either direction. There is a built in timing rig and start lights to control the race. The colouring of the track helps the software identify changes in direction. The RobotsThe YetiBorg HS Zero robots are a new design and will include our already successful ZeroBorg Kickstarter for motor control. The 2mm thick Aluminium chassis are made here at PiBorg.When entering the races you will have a YetiBorg top (called a YetiLid). This is a fibreglass lid with a microsd card slot in it to conveniently store your code when shipping your top. The YetiLids will need to display a unique number for us to identify you and you can decorate your top to make sure you can see your robot.The SoftwareWe have written a basic control software which will be available to use. This will be available on the Formula Pi website and on github. The software can be modified by the competitors to improve performance. Or you can provide your own software if you like! It can be as simple or complex as you want.The winners code is published at the end of the season, so everyone can start the next season from an equal standing. This helps the autonomous software improve and makes for a highly competitive sport.History of Formula PiIt took a lot of testing ideas and programming lots of different code before we got good results. Our very first run was less than successful! We eventually decided that if the track was painted in bright colours, the robots could dedicate more time to processing things such as the position of other robots, collision avoidance, traffic light detection and so on.Project statusWe are ready to go racing with the exception of having a fleet of performance calibrated YetiBorgs for the club robots! This Kickstarter would allow us to buy resources to build robots for competitors to use for racing. The more successful we are, the more competitors we can host.The track has been mostly built, but is missing a timing rig. We have a laser timing rig that we developed for Pi Wars and we will be adapting this with a Pi 3 and Pi Camera to take images of the cars as they pass the start/finish line. We can also use this to check for jump starts.We are intending to buy basic cameras to allow us to broadcast the races on a platform such as Youtube. And this way we can capture all of the action on track and record the races for you to enjoy at any time.The software is mostly ready, we still need to do a few tweaks here and there. We are working on blog material at the same time as coding, so you can see what we have done and why. We have a domain and website dedicated to this project at www.formulapi.com where you will find rules, code and all sorts of useful information.The RewardsThe rewards vary from race entry with a YetiLid to the YetiBorgs themselves. The YetiBorgs are high quality robots which can take the bumps and rubbing of racing.You don't need to have one to be part of the racing, but you might want one to experiment with autonomous robotics or just to drive like an RC car! They come with everything you need with the exception of a 9V battery and a Raspberry Pi Zero.They are made from 2mm thick aluminum and they have high quality metal gear motors similar to a DiddyBorg motor. They also sport the ZeroBorg motor controller we had for our last Kickstarter.The YetiBorgs are supplied with detailed build instructions and our normal high standards of PiBorg support. As always, if there are any problems with building or getting started, we're there to help on our PiBorg forumThis together makes an awesome Raspberry Pi Zero controlled robot!It is even capable of driving after flipping upside down!The TeamPaula Brown - robot assembly and shippingArron Churchill - software design Timothy Freeburn (Director) - hardware design

118," Our goal is to empower people to build what they want when they need it. We believe this can be done by creating an automation technology sharing community that owns all of the necessary building blocks to realize a complete personal micro-factory. To this end we have created an efficient, precise, brilliant, sensitive, extensible, buildable,  and programmable 5+ axes motion platform (a robot arm we affectionately call Dexter).  We have shared all of the source code and manufacturing data under the most permissible open source license (GPL3). What we are trying to do with this Kickstarter project is to find the first tier of collaborators. If you have a passion for robotics and automation, making and tinkering, 3D printing and programming, or you just want to build your own home business building robots, join us.We are a collection of like minded individuals with lots of experience building technology products and bringing them to market. Kent Gilson is a serial entrepreneur and inventor extraordinaire with 30+ years developing deep technology products including FPGA supercomputers and hardware programming languages. Christopher Fry has been a​​​​t MIT for decades, most recently a research scientist at the ​media lab​.​​ He has created many computer languages and development environments. He has a passion for teaching and believes in maker-centric economies as a sustainable model for human flourishing. Hampden Kuhns, a Carnegie Mellon engineering PhD and serial entrepreneur. Todd Enerson is a published scientist with a Biochemistry degree from University of Wisconsin-Madison, 20 plus years in science, sales and marketing.  Richard Fu, Investment banking background, renewable energy focus, bridging Wall Street capital with the sharing economy. Gary Kochis is a 30 year technology veteran, a multi talented hardware, software, and applied mathematics engineer and an experienced entrepreneur. James Wigglesworth is a Mechanical Engineering grad student with a background in robotic arm kinematics. His undergrad and grad research involved using robotic arms to print PCBs and antennas on complex curved surfaces.We have spent the last 5 years (and our collective fortunes) building nearly a dozen prototypes to arrive at what we think is the necessary combination of capabilities to enable a revolution in personal automation and human to machine/human to human (haptic) collaboration (resistance is futile). Lets break it down.5+ Axes motion platform (but don't you need 6?)We get this question a lot. The answer is: it depends on what you want to do. Three axes are enough if you want to do things on a horizontal plane like conventional 3D printing, laser cutting and pallet moving. Add a fourth and you have movement and positioning on many planes. Or, use the forth as a filament extruder and you have a 3D printer (more like a 2.5-D printer). Add a fifth axis and now you get any 3D position with the end pointing in any direction. This can be used to draw/drill/laser/poke on any complex geometry. Or, use the fourth axis to keep parallel to a plane and use the fifth to rotate. Now you have a traditional planar pick-and-place motion system. In reality there are uses for robots with many more axes than 6, think grippers and whole hands as end effectors. We stopped at 5 and added expansion capability in the form of a sixth motor controller and position sensor that is useful for extruders, vacuum generation, a sixth axis etc. and an Arduino embedded in the tool head that can be used to drive multiple servos, sensors of all kinds and... You get the idea.  Also, the motion platform is scalable.  Build it big or build it small, change a few length parameters and our software will just work.    EfficientBy using a FPGA supercomputer to solve the precision control problem, we were able to optimize the physical and electrical architecture of the robot to minimize the mass and therefore the power requirements. All 5 of the stepper motors are placed at strategic locations to lower the center of mass and to statically balance the arm. This way almost all of the torque of the motors is used to move the payload not the robot. Also, we generate all of the voltages needed for the robot from a single supply that can range from as little as 7 volts all the way to 60 volts.  PreciseOne of the breakthroughs we achieved is the ability to very accurately measure the deflection of each axis and do it quickly enough to use this information to control all of the motors simultaneously. We have measured a 50 micron repeatability (worst case scenario) on a robot that is built with 3D printed parts. Brilliant All of this precision and sensitivity could not be done without the computational capabilities of the FPGA supercomputer and an efficient and productive FPGA hardware programming language. We are using an FPGA that has the capacity to perform hundreds of billions of signal processing calculations per second--that's like having thousands of Arduino's. The FPGA brain also has 2 ARM-9 processors running a full Ubuntu Linux OS. You can think of Dexter as a personal computer with a massively parallel real-time sensory cortex that can move and interact with its surroundings.    Sensitive Dexter has a sense of touch that rivals humans. In fact, Dexter's ability to measure the position of each axis is far more sensitive than the robot's motors are able to move. This extra measurement quality combined with algorithms to calculate force over time result in a force sensitivity that can be used for many applications. This force information can be shared between two Dexters to transmit forces over distance and scale--think haptic faxing--or it can be used to simulate computer generated physical environment--haptic video game controllers--or it can be used to sense the amount of force Dexter is applying to a work piece and adjust it to apply just the right amount. This force sensitivity is also used to make it simple to capture position information. By moving the robot to zero out the forces it feels, Dexter essentially follows the movement of its human operator.  BuildableDexter was designed to be manufactured using 3D printed parts from a low cost hobby printer and to minimize the number of specialty parts needed to complete the build while still maintaining structural integrity.  The trick to using a low-cost 3D printed part as a  robust production part is to reinforce the Z dimension with standard carbon
fiber extrusions, cut to size, and steel--we use finish nails.  One of the reasons for making the parts using 3D printing is to make them reproducible by
the robot. With the addition of an extruder end effector (in development), Dexter will be able to fabricate and assemble a majority of the subsystems needed to construct a second Dexter.ExtensibleA strong, precise robot needs tools to make things. And it needs to be able to change tools in the middle of a job. This is why we have given Dexter an interface that combines a two part tool changer with spring loaded connectors for signaling and power. The ability to perform different processing steps during the same ""job"" enables what we call heterogeneous direct digital manufacturing (HDDM).  With one piece of equipment you can
automatically change tools and use additive, subtractive, and assembly processes.  ProgrammableBuilding complexity into hardware is expensive. That's why we push as much complexity as possible into software. Our Dexter Development Environment runs on your PC (Windows, Mac or Linux). It provides a Development Environment for creating ""Jobs"" for making things. DDE can control many different types of materials, end effectors and processes because it is based on a general purpose programming language, JavaScript (the primary programming language of the web). We augment JavaScript with high level classes and methods for describing jobs that automate a number of different processes to make things. Our automatic tool changer enables switching of end effectors on the robot arm to allow complex builds without human intervention. But sometimes human intervention is necessary. Our Job language contains instructions for humans too, so that a process can be defined with discrete human instructions embedded in the process DDE can also synchronize multiple Dexter's should they be needed for especially complex builds.Is all this hard to learn? Usually. But we've compressed decades of programming language and Development Environment design to make DDE as simple as possible (but no simpler!).  The documentation is included in the environment, along with ""click help"" on every character in our text editor.  We have about a hundred examples of code snippets to get you on the right track and speed both learning and implementation. Watch our DDE video to see exactly how.We have shipped our first kits and robots and now need
you!  Creating a community that shares
will allow for further development.  With
your support we can take Dexter to the next level, provide the education and
have a secure portal for sharing.Fully Assembled DexterArm This fully assembled Dexter is ready to go out of the box. It connects to your PC via ethernet and is fully programmable with our open source development environment, DDE. It comes with an automatic tool changer interface, ready to accept any new tools that we develop, are developed by the community, or that you can come up with yourself. These tools will allow you to do so much more than just a 3D printer. DDE has extensive built-in help but we will be putting out tutorials to make your experience as smooth as possible. Dexter has all the capabilities of conventional robotic arms like moving in Cartesian without the price tag (seriously look up the cost of industrial robotic arms). Plus it has capabilities that a lot of those arms don't have. Such as computing power, precision, and force sensing capabilities.Dexter Kit with Printed PartsThe kit includes: NERD STUFFSpecs:  ",Haddington Dynamics,"$108,885",Unstated,"Dexter is a robotic arm powered by an FPGA supercomputer. 5+ axis, trainable and a friendly UI.

When I set the delay in the app to a few seconds, it makes the first part of the whirr, waits a few seconds, then makes the second part of the whirr - all without any visible movement (except for the light). But I'm confident it's not a hardware but a software issue because when I switch the bot in the app to the ""push & pull"" mode, the arm pops out halfway every single time to mount the ""pull"" handle - so it can work reliably under certain conditions.BUT: Unfortunately, the bots are all too weak to work on any of my light switches, which are not rocker switches but have to be pressed in straight... :'( Any known workarounds to increase the bots' leverage or plans to make them stronger?

122," In MatataLab, the story begins from we four co-founders happens to know each other in the robotics industry, facing our own children entering kindergarten age, and we always dream of combining our passion with our children’s education. That's why we designed MatataLab, hands-on coding robot set, make coding easy, fun and inspire creativity. And since we are designing this product for our children, we strive for excellence in every detail.  Why starts ages four?  Around age four the brain lays the groundwork for the development of logic. While there are already many educational robot toys on the market, few of them focus on a crucial stage of brain development. So why don't we just try it out?  Why hands-on coding?  We know kids naturally play and learn by using their hands, building stuff and doing things together. This is essential, and it reminds us of tangible programming which makes code physical, so kids can play with it. With simple logical games, plus a robot to make it fun and give instant feedback, coding is not necessarily to be difficult. Starting young and equipped with the understanding of fundamental concepts, children at a later age will be able to grasp more abstract concepts of real programming at school and can learn without fear.  ""The most important value of the solution you are developing is the tactile learning that is involved and the modular growing complexity of the learning activities that a student can engage with while using your tools."" - Tommaso Dalla Vecchia, Future Classroom Lab, European Schoolnet""Colourful, creative, hands-on. MatataLab’s“Coding like ABC” takes coding to kindergarten level. Using game-based, hands-on coding, even the youngest children can start developing an understanding for computing in the most playful way. This is a relevant step in supporting future coding talents from an early stage on.""- Beate Jost, Technical Manager at Open Roberta, Fraunhofer IAIS""Child-friendly programming is one of the great educational tasks of this century. The coding robot from MatataLab is a milestone in realizing this task.""- Volker Bombien, german publisher, Bombini Verlags GmbH""The most favorite part that I like is that this educational robot not only help young kids to do some exercise of coding game, but it is quite unique product to combine the idea of coding and music creation, which will make this product a possible market winner.""- Christian Göttker Executive VGM, European Educationall Group""This is a very innovative concept to learn logic and coding in an intuitive way, without knowing how to write or read! No computer, no screen, no complicated setup, teachers are going to love it!"" - André Bernot – A4 Technologie |France ""The possibility of learning computer logic through tangible play, without the use of a digital device, will be appealing to many educators. The playful look inspires engagement and makes children want to come back to this tool. The expandability that the product offers is also very important and adds to its appeal.""- Mats Oscarsson Category Manager Education | Sweden “Innovative, clean and very nice design. It is funny and easy for kids and very powerful new way of teaching programming! Congratulations! You have made a brilliant job.”- Iratxe Sáez Robotics BU manager | SpainPeople tend to think that programming is difficult, so we know our first job is not to really teach them how to code, but make them feel easy to code. While easier to use, more kids would like to try it and play with it, thus to make their first program effortless. For this reason, the coding block is designed extremely simple, and physical; you can touch the blocks, see the symbol, and already like to guess what it means. No need for a screen, nor any literacy capability.The symbols are just intuitive icons, e.g., an arrow point forward means let the Robot goes one step forward, in the same way, just name it, you have more icons mean turn left, right, or even note or melody to create music. That’s it, simple like ABC, what you see is what you get! We not only make it easy to code, but also bring a lot of fun ways to play!  With MatataLab, kids don’t feel like serious programming, they are just playing some maze game adventure, create music or even drawing a picture which means something, your kids are born to be an artist, isn’t it?To build a solid and sound logical thinking mindset, don’t be rush, it’s always important to construct a good foundation from a simple concept.Matata Adventurer Sequencing is a very common starting points to help kids explore the world around them. That’s the reason we firstly introduce Matata Adventurer. With several sets of adventure maps, kids are challenged to find different ways to meet the target. As they progress from easy to advanced level, kids learn and use new coding concepts step by step. They can collaborate with their friends or compete with them to complete the challenges. Matata MusicianCoding is cool, and if you like to make one step forward to inspire kids creativity, music could be the best combination. With Matata Musician, kids choose the musical notes and beats they want to combine and the robot plays the song they’ve created. Matata DrawerPainting things could be another creation that you won’t miss! Kids are introduced to basic geometrical concepts as they program the robot to draw creative graphics and designs. Learn to Code  According to CSTA standard, that kids learn to construct programs, in order to solve a problem or for creative expression, that includes sequencing, events, loops, conditionals, parallelism, and variables, using a block-based visual programming language or text-based language, both independently and collaboratively.  Sequencing  To animate his robot, the child must simply use these blocks to build sequences and then associate them with the control tower provided. The latter will then transmit the instruction to the robot and the robot will begin to animate itself by following the different steps defined by the script designed by the child.  Parameters, Loops, Functions  The number blocks will allow kids to quantify its movements and angle blocks to rotate it in one direction or the other. In order to do it right, we also created loop blocks and functional blocks to allow even the most experienced children to go even further.  Debugging  When kids program with a few blocks and hit the button, the robot will just follow the instruction according to the block sequence one by one. So they get the idea in mind that block=action, and if the robot didn’t perform the action or miss target, they can easily start the debug job.Code to learn  Inspired by Logo, Scratch, we extend the possibility of coding. Coding is not just coding, there are more ways to play! Code to learn math, geometry, music. What you have to do is to free your imagination. The family interaction is always a precious hour, with MatataLab, parents don’t need any professional programming skill before you show your kids how it works. As designed very easy to use, and by offering extra warm-up cards and easy-to-advanced booklets, parents can easily play with kids without any worries. Creativity brings to our awareness what was previously hidden and points to new life, so just be your kid's learning partner and explore the new world. More interaction comes from customizing the robot with funny costumes for special occasions, and role-playing through minifigs, all the while exploring the simple programming logic that drives the MatataLab experience. Combined with kids’ favorite clay, paper craft and 3D printing to the robot sets, kids can create their dream world and tell their own stories.  How we make coding so easy?A Matata Block size = Two Lego® brick 2x4, easy for kids to grip and place.Symbols on coding blocks are intuitive icons which are easy to understand.Magnetic connection between blocks: Kids could easily put blocks together with just snapping them.Fool-proofing device to make sure kids place the right blocks and place the blocks right.The coding language is simply designed as intuitive Symbols, and learning resource also try to use the minimum character, no matter what language you speak, or where you come from, all kids can play together indiscriminative of race, gender or education level.How we make it so playful and much fun?Adorable robot design with small size, compatible with official robot cover, 3D printing and more DIY models. Kids are up to change the look of the robot.Inside MatataBot, there are servo motors, pen holder, and mini-speaker, equip with these parts, the robot finally can perform to make precise motion, draw things, and even sing a song.Image recognition technology gives us freedom to design the best and beautiful coding symbol, it will also support the ultimate coding style that you can imagine.Abundant coding blocks to support all your creativity. Symbols are available to update.Is it safe for kids? Children's safety is our top priority, as we design this also for our own baby. We follow strict standards when we design MatataLab. For now, we are in the process of developing pilot production and will gain CE（EN71）, RoHS, ASTM F963-16, CPSIA, 3C, SRRC accreditation certificates before delivery.  Stretch goal #2 Hit! Stretch goal #1 Hit! Currently, we have three MatataLab robot sets, the Starter Set, the Advanced Set, and the Pro Set.  Moreover, add-ons with music, drawing and other complex functions will be available in the future.

123,"  STEAM education can have more fun! That`s why we create Mabot, a modular robot kit that combines education and entertainment for kids and adults to spark their imagination, with hands-on learning, teamwork, and fun.      Each Mabot kit is an incredible robotic system that allows kids to use modular components to create robots and unique functions such as moving, sensing the surroundings and interacting with the environment.Mabot has 4 sets of kits and each of them can be used to build different types of personal multi-functional robots. Then, using the Mabot Go and IDE App, kids can easily control the robots and learn how to program them with additional functions.        Like the structure of human body, Mabot has 5 types of elemental balls, the control ball, the drive ball, the connection ball, the battery ball, and the sensor ball.      Each of the balls is designed into the right size to grab. Mabot is also among the first of its kind that supports hot-plugging, meaning that you can add or remove functional components without turning off the power.By doing so, we ensure the safety and get you concentrated on playing and learning.     The elemental balls might look complicated but actually they are not! Mabot comes with the simple and intuitive Mabot Go App (available on Apple Store & Google Play) that provides easy, step-by-step instructions for you. It is fun to build a robot from scratch but even more awesome when you can enable different useful functions into your robots. With Mabot Go, you can easily program with the simple drag-and-drop for different functions such as changing light colors, driving the wheels, hitting the button, and much more.      After mastering the Mabot Go, it is time to try the next level! Mabot IDE is an advanced programming App but still super easy for kids to use and learn to code. It comes with a visual programming interface which allows you to drag the preset coding blocks and put them in a sequence to realize your desired functions!     PCMAG: ""It will be an excellent way to introduce kids to the magic of manipulating the world through code. It also serves as a nice halfway point between canned solid-state robotic toys and something more complex and nuanced like Lego Mindstorms.""New Atlas: ""The Bell Robot Mabot kit is so easy to build with that my 6-year-old was able to make this robot in about ten minutes using only graphical instructions included with the Mabot Go app.""Fast Company: ""Not all STEM toys deliver on fun, but Mabot puts it first.""Geekdad: ""Overall, the components are pretty good. Assembly is easy and the parts feel fairly sturdy.""Gadget Flow: ""Welcome to the robotic LEGO toys of the future. They’re sleek, smooth, and fun to play with unlike the old robotic sets of yesteryear""     Mabot Go App comes with step-by-step building instructions for 12 different robots, which serve as missions for your kids to complete. Along the way, they will learn building basics and master coding as they go.         The hands-on instructions will lead the users to program their robots in specific ways and challenge them to follow through on their goals. Once you accomplish the missions and get more familiar with Mabot components, you can quickly turn your creativity into reality.           Mabot kit is extendable with additional kits, just like Lego blocks and it will help kids to explore the innovative ways to play together as a team.      Mabot is compatible with Lego bricks, so you can always expand your robots with your own LEGO™ toys for endless combinations of creative fun!      Mabot Go App is currently available on both Apple Store and Google Play. You can download it and take a look at the robot-building instructions!       Mabot IDE provides an easy graphical programming method for kids to code with a simple drag-and-drop method. They can try many different combinations of programming functions as they play and learn. Due to the limited screen space of smartphones, the Mabot IDE App is available only for iPad.    Like a human body that has brain, muscle, legs, and eyes, Mabot has its own computing center, driving wheels, sensors and connection parts. Each serves an important function.  Take a closer look at each of the components:         We are team Bellrobot, the leading robotic and creative science education organization in China. We are providers of robotics education, AI research and development, and science education. We create “learning by doing and playing” curriculums that encourage hands-on learning, imagination, creativity, logical thinking and teamwork for children. We want to bring collaborative, hands-on robotics and programming learning to every kid in the world!

124," Every year, the FIRST LEGO League issues a challenge to teams to research and solve real world problems. Teams are judged on their research of a real world problem and their ability to present their research in a creative way.
 The challenge this year is Hydrodynamics and it's all about water. 
We began our research by visiting many experts to learn about problems with the Human Water Cycle. The human water cycle is how we get, use and dispose of water in our communities. But what happens when human activity negatively impacts the Human Water Cycle? To narrow our focus and understand the most serious problems, we met with experts at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. They told us while certain products, like synthetic fertilizers, are beneficial to humans; they also contain more nutrients than the earth can hold. The problem is the excess nutrients and sediment are washed through our storm drains and into nearby waterways where it pollutes the water we depend on. Untreated stormwater containing these nutrients causes massive algae growth. When these Harmful Algae Blooms die, they consume all the oxygen so nothing in the water can live. This has a huge affect on the human water cycle and our ability to find clean water. 

We met with Mr. Joe Grist, the Environmental Compliance Administrator with the Newport News Department of Engineering. We learned that stormwater runoff is the only source of pollution still increasing in our local waterways. They use many natural ways to reduce the amount of pollutants entering our waterways, such as bioretention ponds, grass swales and rain gardens. We analyzed these solutions and realized two things. First, many of the solutions relied on plants - which use phytoremediation to clean excess nutrients and pollutants from our water - and second, that while these solutions are great, none of them included ordinary people. People who want to help, but don't know how.We wondered what we could do to solve this problem? By using the Engineering Design Process, we had already identified the problem and it was time to brainstorm solutions. We had ideas like rain barrels and rain gardens, but after considering many factors decided that these just wouldn't do the job. So we invented...
 THE BAYSAVERS BUFFER GARDEN KIT!
A buffer garden is a sloped garden built around lakes or rivers to filter run-off with plants before it can reach the water. Our Baysavers Buffer Garden Kit includes everything that homeowners need to be part of the solution by building buffer gardens in their own yards, preventing run-off from reaching storm drains.We met with Dr. Laurie Fox, a Horticulturist with VA Tech, and learned that the best plants for phytoremediation were those that were native, lived all year round and had an extensive root systems. But homeowners needs are important too so we added size and attractiveness to our list. We used the best science to include the seeds for six perfect plants. We also include growing pots, soil pellets, landscape designs, and educational material to help homeowners learn what they can do to be part of the solution. Using the next step in the Engineering Design Process, we tested our kit by building a buffer garden in our own yard and testing the soil. At first, we were shocked that the water exiting our buffer garden had more nutrients than when it entered! We made modifications to our garden, with the help of horticulturists from Virginia Living Museum, and retested. We've included instructors for building a perfect buffer garden in your own yard.With our improvements, our buffer garden prevented almost all of the water from leaving it! We also met with educators from Lynnhaven River Now and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to redesign our educational materials to make them easier to use.But one buffer garden alone cannot stop the flow of stormwater runoff, so we need to get our solution into the community. That's why we need YOU! We envision buffer gardens doing their work to keep our water clean all across Virginia...and eventually the World!******************The BaySavers Buffer Garden Kit comes with two different types of kits - one for shade and one for sun.

125," Robots are great tools for learning – encompassing mechanics, electronics, programming and more. There are learning robots for many ages, but is there one for all ages? Hedgehog tries to come close to this ideal!Hedgehog is a robot controller: it connects to a robot’s motors, servos and sensors and executes the robot’s program. What makes Hedgehog stand out is its consistent white box approach, allowing you to tinker with every part.We worked hard to make Hedgehog what it is: simple enough for use by elementary schoolers, yet versatile enough to allow even university students to learn new things. The secret lies in our modular hardware and software design, together with open source technology throughout.Read on to see what we have to offer for beginners, or scroll down to ""Plug & Play"" to learn about the specs and your options as an advanced user. Look at ""classroom ready"" if you're a teacher looking for a tool for your classes – but do check out the other sections as well.We use the Blockly visual programming editor to allow kids to start their first programming experiences. The programming blocks still use text, so it is appropriate for elementary school and up. Blockly is an open source project developed by Google, with great usability and reliability – a Must for software used by kids.Some day, you will grow out of visual programming, but don't worry – you can transition smoothly into textual programming. You can even convert your existing Blockly programs to Python code, and continue where you left off!We use a web-based integrated development environment (IDE): code on any operating system without installation, using your browser! The IDE's server runs on the controller itself, so an internet connection is not required. Connect to the controller either via WiFi or Ethernet.Apart from programming, the IDE lets you control connected motors and servos, and displays analog and digital sensor values, making it easy to quickly test your creations.Hedgehog is compatible with standard RC servos and DC motors. Choose from a variety of sensors: from simple push buttons to infrared or sonar range sensors, different components can be connected to your robot. A standard webcam can be used to give your robot vision. And you can, of course, add any USB device that the Raspberry Pi supports!All software tools necessary for developing Hedgehog are installed on the controller: an STM32 microcontroller toolchain for the firmware, KiCAD for designing circuit boards, Python 3 and node.js for the server software, and of course Git for getting the sources and blueprints. Our standard case can be made with a laser cutter, just visit your closest fab lab and make your own. Hedgehog is a maker product through and through.You're an experienced programmer, and our beginner-friendly IDE is not enough for you? Or our default Raspbian install doesn't suit your taste? Or you're interested in microcontroller programming and need a simple development platform to get started? Or you don't like the programming languages we support? Or you're reading this in 2020 and the Raspberry Pi 3 has become an antiquity?There are so many things to do, and we try to support you in going your way. That's why we prioritized a modular design with clear interfaces, and easy access to all of Hedgehog's power:This gives you full control, but it also helps us extend Hedgehog's functionality. We use Hedgehog everyday in our workshops, so we want it to be the best controller it can be!Hedgehog is developed for the classroom as well: by default, controllers connect to an existing WiFi network, avoiding the overload that would result from a one-network-per-controller strategy. The large range of use cases makes Hedgehog a long-term investment: teach programming to elementary schoolers and undergrads, on the same device. Introduce computer vision and closed-loop control, with the same device. Explain closed-loop control and gear ratios, using Hedgehog.At the Practical Robotics Institute Austria, we already use Hedgehog in classes, workshops, robotics competitions and projects, and we know how well it works. It has already helped us engage dozens of kids with engineering subjects, and inspired multiple bachelor's and high school diploma thesis projects.We are certain that Hedgehog is the right tool for robotics beginners, enthusiasts and educators alike, but to get it out into the world, we need your help. With the money raised from this campaign, we want to fund a first larger production run. What you get in return is not just a product, but a product supported by a team that is invested in its success. Support us with a small amount to get listed as a supporter, or to get the Pac-Hog T-Shirt. Choose a ""Do it Yourself"" option if you have a Raspberry Pi and are not afraid of installing the Hedgehog SD card yourself. (We provide images, and instructions for starting with bare Raspbian)Choose the ""Hedgehog Controller"" or ""Hedgehog Robot Kit"" options to get a ready-to-run controller, fully assembled and installed. The robot kit includes all parts for building a driving robot.Choose between a one-day afternoon session for anyone, and a one-week robotics course for teenagers, both in August 2017 in Vienna, Austria. Workshops are held in German!Feel the satisfaction of making a big difference.

126," This is the initial launch of our product so we are pulling out all the stops. Whether you consider it a sport, a hobby, or a pastime, we are ultimately trying to revolutionize fishing. We feel this is the step in the right direction. We are throwing down the gauntlet and challenging the rest of the industry to meet high standards—to integrate modern technology with a timeless practice and beautiful art. Picture it: you're a dad and you like to fish. You happen to have a child who also likes to fish, or you are just out with the guys on the lake having a good time. This is the making of a beautiful outing in the tradition of a cherished pastime. Yet, fishing can get boring and ineffective with lifeless bait. It also doesn't help that you have to keep moving the rod all the time to give the bait the appearance of movement. But why settle for an illusion when you can have the real thing?

That's where Animated Lure comes in—a self-propelling lure that takes care of the tedious work for you. You can use that valuable time to bond. After all, fishing is often meant to be a social experience. It can enhance the professional fisherman's experience, too. Whatever your situation, your focus should be about catching big game, not bobbing the rod up and down and casting the line over and over again.Without going into the finer details of how it works (we do have a patent pending; refer to the FAQ for more info on that), suffice it to say that we've done extensive research over multiple years of trial and error and have concluded that there's nothing like Animated Lure on the market. Sure, there are ""lures"" that shake and vibrate—but cellphones can do that, too. They’re nothing special. Fishing bait deserves something more sophisticated - something geared specifically towards the art of fishing. With Animated Lure, our aim is to create a truly lifelike fishing lure at an affordable price, enabling us to bring fishing to life.
What you see in the video is one of our earlier prototypes. Think of it as a proof of concept—we wanted to demonstrate the feasibility of this product. Now that we have a foundation, we just need your help to make the little guy in the video become bigger, better, and more elegant with taking it to the market. We decided to have a launch party so we can show our gratitude to those who are able to give us a chance. We want to build a close community of individuals that want to see fishing brought to life. One of the ways to do that is to have an annual celebration that looks back on the accomplishments of the past year and announces the aspirations of the year to come.We truly hold these words to be self-evident and try our best as individuals and a company to uphold them:“Do not be content with showing friendship in words alone, let your heart burn with loving kindness for all who may cross your path.”Our launch party will be in Dallas, Texas, but in future years, we might have our annual celebration in different cities! Our goal is to always have our party in March. For our first party this year, we are going to have it on March 19th. The party will start at 7:30 and go until midnight.Monday, March 21st – product sales begins  (Products can be bought at animatedlure.com) ",Young Talented Pioneers LLC,"$22,041",Unstated,"Animated Lure is a mechanized, self-propelling fishing lure that is electronically programmed to swim like a real fish.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,130 ," With This design: - which is the swimming maximum time? - you lost the possibility to charge via usb? - which battery type will you install?

128," Bluetooth is available now as an add-on option. To control your uArm wirelessly as well as having the opportunity to be the first to play with our smart phone apps, you can back us with an additional $30 and send us an email to feedback@ufactory.cc See more details about the Bluetooth here.When hearing the word “robot”, most of us may think
of the giant industrial robot arms. They can precisely install the components
at a very high speed, or handle many complex, even dangerous tasks. Robots are awesome, and wouldn’t it be nice if everybody
who wants a robot arm can actually afford one? After all, $50,000 is kind of a
lot of money. This is when we, the UFactory come in. UFactory stands for “Your
Factory”. We build various robotics products to make robots more accessible for
everyone! That’s why we started the uArm project - a desktop miniature robot
arm.What is uArm?uArm is a 4-axis parallel-mechanism robot arm, inspired by
the ABB PalletPack industrial robot arm IRB460. It is made up of laser cut acrylic or
wood parts, powered by standard RC hobby servos, and controlled by an
Arduino-compatible board. In parallel-mechanism robot arm, most of the masses concentrate
on the base, making the robot much more stable and allows the upper Arm to
react really fast.Above are some
of the prototypes we had so far.What can you do with uArm?Well, in two words: COOL Things!!!Once you got your uArm, you can immediately customize it with your own components. For example:You can add a LED to make a computer-controlled desk lamp!Or install it on the arm on a mobile robot chassis base and move it around.Or play music!Or help you to send business card!Or make a small assembly line at your desk!Or program it to do your homework!OK, probably not doing your homework. But the possibilities are infinite; there are many more fun applications that can be done by using your uArm kit. And as you try to make it work, you will learn a lot about robotics and coding.The uArm can also be a great gift to get people interested in Robotics. Since it could be easily controlled with a smartphone, people with no programming background can also enjoy the fun of robotics.After all, even if you don’t plan to do anything with it, a desktop robot arm will be a WONDERFUL decoration!How
do I use it?Right now we have already developed a Windows
application that allows the uArm to be controlled with keyboard or mouse. A serial communication program that uses Processing to create a host computer program that displays simple OpenGL object to show the orientation of the controls and reads keyborad event then sends command to the uArm.Using mouse to control uArm to play Cup Stacking via
serial.With
some basic controlling skills, you can use basically any input device to
control it, for example, we have also used other remote controller to control the arm. With our imbedded inverse-kinematics algorithm, the uArm can be
precisely controlled using coordinates. We are currently working with the Android and
IOS apps as well, so you can control the uArm via Bluetooth as well. We have also written an Arduino library specifically for controlling the
uArm. So if you are familiar with Arduino, you can program it directly with
Arduino IDE. By calling different functions, you can easily move uArm to your
desired position without doing tons of hard math. UPDATE: We have just sketched out a new function for the uArm which allows you 
to simply dragging it around as the uArm records the critical 
coordinates for later playback! With this function, you can now TEACH 
the uArm to accomplish simple tasks without writing a single line of 
code, or even connecting to your computer！Further Details:The basic design is Arduino-controlled with 4 degrees of
freedom. Three servos on the base control the main movement of the arm and the mini
servo on the top moves and rotates the object. The end-effector of the arm is
always kept parallel to the ground.We also made some other designs of the end-effector for applications and extensions.Mechanical Parts:The structure of the arm is made up of laser cut acrylic or wood parts.In addition to some screws, nuts and brass stand-offs, we also provide some flanged bearings, one large bearing, and 4 suction cups for you to complete the assembly of the arm.By adding the bearings the arm can work smoothly and stable.These parts, along with the servos, allow you to build the arm and a gripper end-effector.Electronic Parts:The micro-controller is an Arduino compatible board. And we also develop a shield for Arduino to drive the vacuum pump and the servos. In additional, the power supply board will be on the shield, too.The electronic parts of the Basic uArm consist of 3
standard servos, 1 micro servo, 1 Arduino-compatible board, 1 uArm shield, 1
USB cable and 1 wall adapter power supply.The electronic parts for the gripper end-effector
consist of 1 micro servo.The electronic parts for the suction cup end-effector
consist of 1 small vacuum pump and 1 solenoid valve.The
electronic parts for EARLY BIRD & Gripper Kit：The
electronic parts for Suction Cup Kit：The electronic parts for Replaceable Kit, Custom
Message Engraved Kit, Complete Assembled Kit & Advanced Kit:Mounting:The uArm comes standard with 4 suction cups for the
base of the arm, to allow you to mount the arm on any smooth horizontal
surface, such as a smooth desktop or floor.You can also install the arm on a mobile robot chassis
base and move it around.uArm Work Envelope (working range of the arm):What is the payload weight capacity for uArm?In our informal testing, we have found that the uArm can
easily lift and move a regular can of soda. More testing will be carried out later and more accurate data will be specified.Open
source!!!uArm will be completely open-sourced after the
Kickstarter campaign completes! We will use the time in between to optimize our
design and make it the best it can be. We are a company, yes, but we are also a
group of robot maniacs. We want to share our joy with the rest of the world and
make more people realize how fun robotics can be! All of the design files,
hardware and software will be released in May, 2014. So you can build your own
arm using a laser cutter, then add you own controller and servos to it. Even if this project fails, we will still release all the
files online. If this project succeeds, though, we will be able to launch more
open source robotics kits and mechanical platforms! Cheers!How to assemble uArm?We will offer a full step-by-step tutorial describing
how to assemble uArm after we finish the finial design. Now we have a simple Assembly Diagram for the current version.Mechanical Parts:The major revisions of the mechanical parts are on the thickness of the Acrylic parts and the base of the arm.We changed the thickness from 3mm to 5mm.We have made an electronic module holder
for the electronic parts and also made a case for the vacuum pump and
solenoid valve in the latest version.We have made 3 versions of the base of the arm so far. In
the first version, the mounting is not convenient. So in the second
version, we added 4 suction cups on the base and you can also use screws
and nuts for mounting. In the third version, we added a bearing on the base, so
the arm can move smoothly and stable.Electronic Parts:With electronic parts, we have made 5 versions so far. In
the latest version, we make a shield of Arduino for the arm to drive the vacuum
pump and the servos. In additional, the power supply board will be on the
shield, too. The micro-controller in the final version is still an Arduino
compatible board.The first version: A micro-controller board, a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve. The second version: A micro-controller board (Arduino Leonardo), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve. The third version:A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve. The fourth version: A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.The fifth version:A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), an uArm shield, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.The latest version we have made so far:We are robot maniacs with the goal of making
robotics kits more accessible to the public and we want to help more people to
see the beauty of robotics!uArm is our first developed platform. We now
have several prototypes, but they can still be made better. Currently the uArm
can’t perform super accurate motion due to our tight budget; also if we can
injection mold some of the parts, the assembly process can be greatly
simplified; We are also planning to design and build the next version of the
arm. It will be stepper-motor driven with metal frames thus it will be
more accurate. And we will add remote control function on PC, Mac and Smart
Phones as well. Furthermore, if we can get gather enough public attention, we
can corporate with big companies to send these robot arms to schools, and give
children access to robots!We are eager to make the uArm better, cheaper and easily
accessible. so more people can enjoy the fun of robotics. And all of these
cannot be done without your support!As rewards, we will offer the parts or a complete kit to build
your own uArm from acrylic or wood. Only Complete Assembled Kit and Advanced
Kit are assembled.

I can imagine it hasn't been easy. I'm happy with what was delivered even though I had extra cost thrown on due to shipping. Keep working hard and remember you can't make everyone happy! :)~I like surprises but not ones that cost me.  I also just received a UPS bill for ~13USD that I didn't expect (am in MA, USA).  This is rather annoying since I'm currently traveling out of the country (my roommate notified me) and they do have a rather short notice before late fees kick in.  ~Just thought I'd balance out the negative posts and report my uArm arrived fast, with no extra charges, no missing parts and the arm is working great with the software.~@Ufactory we are still unable to post in the forums without admin review/approval.. you might want to check on the settings..~The bill from UPS shows a Duty Class of 8479.50.0000 which is described at http://hts.usitc.gov/Table%2084.xml#8479.50.0000 as ""Industrial robots, not elsewhere specified or included"". Lol. The customs form at the point of origin probably should have said something along the lines of ""consumer hobby kit"". But that's just conjecture. I'm going to call UPS and contest it. I'm not optimistic. Side note: There are no instructions on the bill or their web site on how to pay it online.~Thank you so much for getting everything worked out, I'm sure everything has been extremely hectic and I am extremely pleased to see that you value your customers in such a way. Thank you so much Eric!  I will definitely be telling others of your amazing product and great service!~I got a bill from UPS also.  $12US.  I chalk it up to UFactory is a new company and this is a Kickstarter project so things don't always go smoothly.  I am happy that they are working very hard to get it right.  It will just take time and patience.~I still have not heard anything about not receiving my pump kit board which has completely stopped this project in its tracks until I can obtain it. I also was not gonna bring up the fact that I am being charged more for shipping by the post office, but it has been three days and I have not even received an email saying sorry, and that you are working to get me the pump kit board which was supposed to already be in my kit to begin with. Please rectify the issue as what you do in these kickstarter times is what everyone is going to presume you are going to do as a whole. This is the first issue like this I have had on kickstarter and I am quite dissappointed to say the least!~@ufactory is the code for ""teaching"" the robot going to be released in this current library? Or is that not ready yet?~are those of you just getting UPS bills in the US?~I also just got a UPS bill. I'm seeing a $5.48 tariff. What's really frustrating is the additional $7 ""disbursement fee"" that UPS is tacking on. Have y'all talked to UPS about this yet?~just for fun ^^ timelapse of my assembly https://twitter.com/evil4dmin/status/472680262627631104~Same, just got a UPS bill for about $13.  What is up with this?  Your margin should be very solid on this so why are you now making us pay more?  Is this an oversight on your part or was this done knowing that the bill would end up on our doorsteps?~Yeah I just got a bill from UPS too. Very not cool. Nowhere in any of your materials here on kickstarter did it say I'd be paying any additional fees. You guys need to make this right.~yes here my fee ....  39.57 in canadian tax ( that it what I was planning to pay) but I cost me 66.03, so UPS got 26.46 for making the brokage ...  add that to the $25 more to ship it to Canada,  and UPS international  got  the usual $50plus for crossing the border ...    standart canada china post cost $5 in brokage fee,  FedEx and DHL are around $10 to $15 in brokage fee ( for the same speed of UPS)   ....   Again you should NEVER use UPS for international ... at least to Canada !!!~I just got a bill from UPS for my delivery -- $14.00. Not really happy about it. Shouldn't your company cover the brokerage fees?~Ok, my uArm is assembled and ready to go! The assembly certainly tested my manual dexterity, but it was a lot of fun and the parts fit together really nicely.

One of the most popular robots, IRB 2400, will set you back $50K+ and you will need an engineering degree to program it.We believe that robot should be for everyone.  So we developed a miniature of IRB 2400 at half the price of an iPhone.  And you don’t even need a single line of code to teach it how to move!Teach it like a child by holding its hand, and it will replay precisely.   A robot called Baxter can also record and replay but it costs $22000.Grandpa (who doesn’t even know how to use iPhone) taught it Chinese Calligraphy by holding its arm. Damn, now it writes better than all of us in the team!Using leapmotion or kinect sensor, it will just follow your exact motion in realtime.  Again, no coding is needed for you.Of course, you can still use your mouse or keyboard to control it.  Even over the web remotely.By plugging in a USB camera and using our sample computer vision code,  7Bot can see and think.  Watch how it sorts the lemons by colors.And it can even read and understand the math, and do the homework for you.  Well, may not be you but your 7 years old kid.7Bot Arm is a 6-axis desktop robot arm that is able to see, think and learn. It is precise, durable, versatile and intelligent.  With all Aluminum Body and 6 degrees of freedom powered by high torque metal digital servos with force-control supported, 7Bot has rugged reliability with exceptional performance in torque and speed, even close to the industry robot arm. When you want to move up the next level in the iPad game but you are getting bored with the current level.  You have a helping hand.  (The screen wasn't broken by 7Bot, please understand we are saving every penny on the project.)Play Xylophone by watching the colors of the blocks.Play chess with a human.Paint a cherry blossom7Bot Basic: Vacuum Cup GripperThe Vacuum Cup Gripper is one of the most useful accessories for 7Bot. Powered by a 5V Air Vacuum pump and valve, it picks up most objects with smooth surface up to 1kg.  You can use your Arduino, Raspberry Pi or any other micro-controller board to control this gripper through 2 digital signals.7Bot Pro: Vacuum Cup + Two-Finger GripperHuman isn't octopus and we are born with fingers.  So we offer the two-finger gripper to grasp objects within 500g payload.  Working stroke of gripper can be justified by replacing its fingers.  We will open source the design of finger gripper so that you can customize it for different application.7Bot DualHuman is born with 2 arms and we should treat Robot the same.  That's why we offer 7Bot dual.  By providing two 7Bot Arms, you can build a humanoid with less than 5% of the cost you can source elsewhere.  With our computer vision and AI capabilities, 7Bot humanoid can even perform things better than you, like solving for Rubik's cube.And don't be limited by our imagination, build your humanoid with 7bot and show us what it can do!7Bot Mobile: Building a Mars RoverYes, we have thought of it too!  So we proudly provide an omni-directional mobile platform as an option.  Now you can build your own Mars Rover on 4 mecanum wheels using our ""7Bot mobile"" package at $1397.  Only 25 units are available!7Bot studioWe open source the drawing of our end-effectors so that you can either customized or just reprint your own end-effectors.  If you don't have a 3D printer, you can choose our ""7Bot studio"" package.  It includes a 7bot, a 7bot dual humanoid, a 7bot mobile and a 3D pinter!  Only 5 sets are available.Here's the summary of the rewards tier:While 7Bot could provide you a fantastic and awesome hardware, programming a robot is no trivial thing, especially for the users without very strong engineering background. So we offer a various of controlling and programming methods, from very basic level to the most advanced level.Remote control is the easiest way for you to control your 7Bot Arm.  Basically, you can use any widely used human interactive device as the controller, from traditional mouse and keyboard, to gesture control devices like Leapmotion and Kinect sensors. You can use a Leapmotion sensor to control 7Bot Arm to follow your gestures, and use Kinect sensors to make the 7Bot ARM dual imitate your movement of upper limb in real-time.With our embedded inverse-kinematics algorithm, the 7Bot Arm can also be precisely controlled using coordinates. And we have made web controlling application by using a Raspberry Pi as the host and with real time feedback. Our custom servos with precise position feedback allow you to quickly set it up and operate in teaching mode without any codes. In this mode, you can simply drag each joint of the robot to a serious of desired way points. The movements will be recorded, and could be replayed in an optimized path. Using teaching mode, you can easily guide your 7Bot Arm performing some tasks.A multi-platform supported 3D visualization application will be provided for you to manipulate the 7Bot Arm intuitively. With our 3D visualization application, you can easily set and read the position of each joint separately with real-time graphic interface.The 3D model in the application could be interacted and controlled with mouse and keyboard. The robot can follow the movement in real-time. Or on the other side, you can perform simulation first, and generate way-point with the software, and then download the optimized moving path to your 7Bot Arm. This is well suited for many algorithms that need lots of iterations in simulation, like reinforcement learning. You can get rid of any low-level coding for the robot.The 7Bot Arm is compatible with Scratch. You can use Scratch Programming Environment to program the 7Bot Arm. Graphical Programming, super easy way!While for advanced users, we provide a wide range of open-source software APIs in C and c++. 
We will also open source the design with motion planning and vision supported, for more advanced developing.7Bot Arm Technical Specifications7Bot Arm Joint motor Specifications

Works like a charm with processing. But your http://forum.7bot.cc/  does not seem to work? Would like to ask there some technical questions, so I ask here. Has anyone integrated additional sensors or actuators on the Arduino board running  the software system? Would be very happy about a small example, how to approach this. Kind regards  Mischa~Hi 7Bot,You did a good job, but any software update will be great. What about Scratch project ? I was a really good idea for education and learning.Best regardsStanislas~Dear 7Bot~@WAI LEUN - that could be a good idea. so there IS a center position? there's no calibration of the center point from software I suppose.~@Ludwig, Maybe you need to let the servo move to its center before mounting it to the servo horn?~Hi! We received a replacement servo, installed it, but now we've run into a strange problem. Upon startup the main arm will raise to a specific point and it cannot be made to go back below that point. It's like the coordinates have shifted. We've tried resets and flashing but issue persists. PLEASE HELP!~Has anyone had any luck getting their 7Bot working with a leap motion?~@ Creator: Could you update the stand's shipping date. Thanks.~Thanks @Chris Katzbichler!~@Amit: Yes, it is the one you suspected (SUNY 6V/10Amps.)~@all, just have set my own campaign online: www.kickstarter.com/projects/687112352/project-angerdine-nationwide-anger-management~hey guys I kind of mixed up 7Bot AC adapter with my other power adapters (was cleaning up my work area). I think it uses the 6 V @ 10 amp AC adapter (I think it is the SUNY AC DC Adapter brand). Can someone please confirm? I will appreciate it.~@Andrew ConruI wonder if you can give me some advice.I sent messages to your official page and Facebook, I think that the former is on error states.Please contact my email ""order(at)mtmsystems.jp"" or show your mail address.Regards,~@creators : I've sent a few emails such as the one below without any response.  I am going to assume that you are uninterested or are not checking your info@ email.  ~@ Creator: i would keep spamming my question about when i will receive the package in full of accessories as stated with my pledged Mobile 7bot of #1,397 over and over again until i have a proper answer from you about the shipment date of the rest missing accessories of the Mobile 7bot pledge~@Creator @7bot Will you be looking into fixing the firmware bug that causes erratic movement soon?  I am holding back from doing more testing and development on the arm because from other people it sounds like it is possible to cause considerable damage to the robot from this erratic movement.~@ Creators: I wonder when i will receive the package in full of accessories as stated with my pledged Mobile 7bot of #1,397.~@Zhengtian Not sure what your asking. If your question is based on my recent comments. Then the only sensor information available is the servo position analog feedback signals which are used to measure arm position and provide limited force and obstacle detection. However I do plan to add a force sensor and accelerometer.~Hi All,~@ William Dutcher   What sensor do you use?~7Bot:Thank you for all your hard work making a quality arm with record/play motion software.  ~To persons who want to get 7bot's servos,~@ Creators: I wonder when i will receive the package in full as stated with my pledge of Mobile 7bot of #1,397.~As you informed us that the kit had been shipped out s by ShunFeng Express last week, but until now we have not received the kit! please check for it and let us know the reason. thanks a lot ! 我们还未收到货物，请确定顺丰寄出的时间及快递号发给我们。 谢谢！~Hello 7Bot Team, ~@r.shirono, I would need at most two servos.~We will buy some 7bot’s servos for our projects.But... a minimum business order lot of supplier is 100.For now, It's too much.Would you need them?~Hi, Richard,many thanks for your comment. I also opened the top of the servo but I couldn't unscrew all screws. Screws seem to have some kind of glue at the end (https://www.dropbox.com/s/hksfkr03dsa4f8g/IMG_7748.jpg…) which prevent some of them for being unscrewed so I had finally to cut their heads. ~For the people that might have feedback problem. I wrote a (very basic) windows application, that allows you to control 7bot, but also read out the feedback. Place it in ""FreeMove"" and while moving you should see the readout on the screen change for each axis.~Hi Antonio, ~@Creator, @7Bot - Dear 7Bot team! Do you have a progress update on the humanoid stand for the Dual arm configurations?~@Adam, @Wai, @7bot, I noticed this erratic behaviour as well. Seems like the firmware is having trouble determining how to get to its home position from certain positions during reset. Definitely a firmware bug and could cause damage or injury if not corrected.~@Creator, @7bot, or othersServo 2 in my 7Bot has a mechanical issue and it's no longer working so I need a replacement. ~@Adam,I have notice the erratic movement too. The movement is very wide and sudden.~@7bot I really love this robot, great work!One thing I have noticed is that sometimes when I press reset the robot will do a random erratic movement before moving smoothly back to its default position.  Does anyone know why this might be?  Sometimes the moves are quite big and fast so it can be quite dangerous.~@7bot/ everyoneI was playing with the robot using ""softwaresystem"" which requires me to press the button at the back of the robot arm. However, for some reason, after playing with it for sometime, pressing the button(long press) does not activate the manual programming of the arm anymore. I have checked, the arm is still working with the rest of the GUI. i.e. the hardware is still working. I have also restarted my pc, but it still doesnt allow manual programming. Kindly advise what could have gone wrong. Thank you.~@Andrew, You can find 7Bot's communication protocol at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/pytci253ql5lmey/Communication%20Instruction%20(v1.0.1).pdf…~Still trying to communicate to the arm in c++ on a mac/Unix but I don't know enough about low level serial port communication.  Ideally, I would like to be able to use the Arm7Bot object but it appears that it will only work in the Arduino IDE (right?).  So far, I've only been able to get the arm to twitch as ""proof of life"" using this:~@Francis, Let us know what you find.~could you share the 3D model files for printing the pen holder? I want to train my robot to write!~@William - Thanks for the suggestion, I'll crack it open and take a look~We haven't received the 7Bot yet. Could you send us the tracking number! Thank you! Please reply! Very urgent!!! From Zhuhai Backer~@Francis. Sounds like a feedback signal problem. Since the servo works when commanded, the servo is good and it's internal PID controller is seeing a feedback signal. So the problem has to be with the forth wire conning out of the servo, with is the feedback signal used by the controller to record movements. It is very likely that the single pin connector for this servo slipped off the pin or not making good contact with the pin on the controller board inside the base of the arm. You may have to remove the plate and check it that connector is plugged all the way in and has not come loose. There are directions online for opening the base and identifying the correct connector.7Bot or others may want to add their thoughts before you open the base up.~@Creator or others - I've finally gotten around to tinkering with the arm, and seem to have an issue with the axis 1 encoder.  I've described my symptom here hoping that someone may have encountered and fixed it already without having to replace servos?~Hello, everyone. I've been playing around with my 7Bot arm and certainly it's a nice product. My sincere congratulations for 7Bot team. ~I tried to control the robot arm from python, and it seems like to work well and the code is much simple compared to the java code. https://github.com/woshialex/py7bot. I'll try add more functionality to it :D~We haven't received the 7Bot yet. Please reply! urgent!!!~",0.0,"$50,000","7Bot: a $350 Robotic Arm that can See, Think and Learn! by 7Bot — Kickstarter"

132,"   If you’ve ever mopped a floor, you will instantly see the appeal in this magnificent device. It’s autonomous, meaning it can mop any floor without human direction. It has built in multi-directional and multi-axis sensors, meaning it can detect and avoid obstacles like furniture or objects left behind and can even detect and avoid hazards like staircases, floor vents and drains with its vertical floor sensor. It is also remote-controlled, meaning you can direct it where you need cleaning and keep it focused on a dirty floor until it sparkles.        Everybot developed the RoboSpin Technology which controls the speed and direction using two dual spin mops without having to utilize wheels. RoboSpin Technology, which was developed after years of study and testing, consists of mechanical engineered technology, dynamics technology, and motor controlled algorithm. With this system, our device can use optimized cleaning modes to clean everything from harmful fine dust to wax residue to stains. It can control speed and direction of each pad on its own, meaning it can implement and optimize cleaning action automatically. This device knows everything we know about mopping floors and then some!   Patented water tanks and water supply system can easily clean your floor using the wet mops, thus saving you from the hassle of refilling the water tank every once in a while.   Perfect wet-mop cleaning by two kinds of mop constructions (Diving Yarn + Microﬁber)Diving yarn can wipe dirt and polluted particles. Microﬁber can absorb the ﬁne dust and stains effectively. Two different mop constructions can improve the cleaning capability and performance.  Mop pads can be cleaned in the laundry or you can hand wash them.  It will be as good as new.  One Touch Operation for Ease of UseExtremely easy to operate, simply at the touch of a button or a remote controller, this device is wireless, eliminating all the hassle and mess of tangling cables in the house. When met with obstacles such as a wall or furniture while in motion, this sensor can detect it and travel on a different route to minimize contact with its bumpers.  When met with a falling area such a stairway, cliff, while cleaning, sensors will be able to avoid it and travel on a different route.   ESA (Exit Shadow Area) Technology If you think the obstacle sensors are all the electronics this little device has, you’re in for a surprise. What if we told you the Everybot knows to move back to a well-lit location after it is done cleaning? Think about it. If you have a dirty floor under a piece of furniture, normally you would have to move that furniture out of the way and then mop the floor yourself. But not any more. Not only can the Everybot drive right under that furniture and clean the floor until it is spotless, it will drive itself back out from under that piece of furniture when the job is done using its unique ESA (Exit Shadow Area) technology! Customers can select optimized cleaning modes according to their house conditions- Floor materials, structures, and types- Types of furniture arrangements and the level of cleanliness on the floorsHandy Cleaning Mode: Users can clean anywhere using the EVERYBOT's handle. Clean everything from desks, tables, glass windows, and cars which are all difficult to clean.Dry Mop Cleaning Mode: Dry mop cleaning mode can adsorb ﬁnd dust tightly. RS700 can clean the ﬂoors by not only wet mop cleaning patterns but also a dry mop cleaning pattern designed by numerous test and know-how. Electrostatics cleaning method can remove pet hair, clothes lint, and tiny dust which is not visible to eyes. Demonstration Video of RS700 Cleaning Various Stains on Different Floors.Comparison Video of other brand model vs Everybot RS500(Previous Model.  RS700 is an upgraded version but basic Robospin Technology is the same) Video of Everybot RS700 in Use Video of Everybot RS700 Wet Mopping Video of Everytbot RS700 Dry Mop / Dust Cleaning      Conquered the world with the wet mop cleaning robot, Everybot CEO Woochul Chung, “we made it solely practical”Everybot, founded in January 2015 by Woochul Chung the CEO, developed the 1st generation personal service robot. Chung is the expert of the expert now that he has been in the robot cleaner industry for 12 years. Chung started off as a development manager at a robot company but since the company was experiencing a financial downfall, he had to stand alone. Everybot consists mostly of the employees from the experts at the previous company, and Chung is actively growing the company. We heard more from Woochul Chung, CEO, who made people around the world fall in love with the unique peanut shaped machine with outstanding technology and reasonable price, about his inspiration for starting the business, his business philosophy, and more.The birth of “Everybot” from the conceptual shift.“I have been developing the robot, and the consumers were very interested in the first generation everyday use robot. However, the reality of the robot cleaners was that they could not properly clean because there were obstacles in the way and the consumers were dissatisfied about the high price. After asking a 3rd party to research what the consumers want, we found out that the answers were “cheap price” and “mop cleaning”. The normal vacuum cleaners are not hard to use, but just gets lazy to do it. However, mopping requires strength so the consumers constantly found it needy. So I thought of making a robot cleaner that could mop.”Of the former robot cleaners, there have been ones that also had the mopping feature. Because they only rely on their weight, they lacked strength like a child would mop. While Chung pondered about how to make it cheaper and still effectively clean, he thought of the car’s alignment, which measures the suspension and caster angles in the front of the car. Chung said, “the car wheels look like they are straight from the naked eye but they have intricate angles within that we cannot see. In order to make the circular mop rotating panel to rotate in a stationary position, it becomes harder to move around but changing angles to this allows for it to move forward. Our product cleans while rotating but also is made to move and work only with the rotating panel and the mop so that we could reduce the unit cost. Therefore, we produced a product, “Everybot,” that meets the practical needs.”Attract the consumers with a unique identity.Chung believes that the most important aspect in dominating over the market are unique product and idea, and he said, “the funny thing is that there are globally large-scale companies in the home electronics market but the middle and small sized companies tend to outstand them. This is because they begin with a unique idea and they are able to dominate the market. Also, I think that the design is as important as the technique in making a product. A lot of the products that the middle and small sized companies produce lack in the design aspect. We focus a lot on making the product design, catalog, and web skills all match in style and unique.” He also emphasized that he wants to grow the company and at the same time make everyone around the world think of “Everybot” for the personal service robot by using the B2B (Business to Business) method along with foreign companies to make more profit and provide techniques.3 conditions to success: challenge, overcome, accomplishmentWhen Chung was young, he thought “how do people succeed?” and tried to look for the methods to success. The answer was pretty simple. It was “challenge.” He said that he needs to challenge himself because if he doesn’t do anything, nothing happens. Also, he believes that a strong will to “overcome” the obstacles is necessary after challenging himself and when various techniques harmoniously come together, he is able to “accomplish” something. So he highlighted those three words, challenge, overcome, and accomplishment. “We can’t live all our lives by just working and we need to enjoy our lives. We need to work hard and be competent in the social role outside and at home, we need to be great in taking part as the head of the family and a parent, spending good times with the kids.”I wish the best for Everybot to be the world’s “Everybot” through Woochul Chung’s, CEO, endless challenges and passion for the better quality of life.        There is so much to tell you about this marvel of technology that we’re running out of room! We want to bring this product to market, and to do that we need your help. In exchange for your generous contribution, we would like to invite you to be a part of autonomous cleaning history and help us bring the Everybot to every home. We have some interesting exclusives for our contributors, and some one-of-a-kind rewards for our top backers. We consider this a unique opportunity to literally blaze a path for other time and money-saving household robots to follow, and we want to make sure all our customers and contributors get a top value for their financial contributions to our exciting campaign. Join us, and help us finally advance mop technology into the 21st century.

I have messaged multiple times with no responseMy tracking information has been saying “Expected departure date from the port” since 03 January!~@Edward Nowicki, How long did it take for yours to arrive, i.e. from ""Expected departure date from the port"" to the time you received it?~Help! My water tanks have completely broke apart! Both of them have cracked all the way around the clear plastic part that the water goes into rendering them unusable and completely unfixable. I only used a mixture of water and a floor cleaner diluted. I read that it could use any cleaning solution as long as its water which it was!  I need two new ones please! Please message me to get an updated shipping address please!~Hi, I received the package. Great, thanks.~Hi!~I have receiced my everybot some days ago. However, you have enclosed the wrong power adapter. The plugs are not compatible with German plugs. Please provide me with the correct one. Furthermore please mail me an invoice. Thanks a lot.~I received my everybot late January this year and have only used it about four or five times, yet there are already pieces that are falling off. The little black plastic pieces holding the mop heads in place have been snapping off. I have not dropped Nor damage the machine in any other way, and have been just using it as instructed. Please let me know whether you can send me a replacement or a refund. ~Ok so I received the package today.

Can you pls investigate and update me thank you.~When is my robot going to be shipped? I am waiting patiently since December...  Please send me an update about the status.~I have not yet received any tracking number. What is the tracking number for me ???!~I have not recived my reward, it is illegal in germany.(for further questions Email me or the ""Bundesnetzagentur"") ~Still waiting for an update Everybot. I have tried contacting you multiple times but you have ailed to response. If I don't get an update from you by the end of this week, I am going to approach my credit card company for breach of contract under Article 75 of the Consumer Credit Act in the UK. Then it'll be between you and Kickstarter to sort it out.~So my Journey continues.I got post from the customs. They do not allow the Everybot. Because the Charging Adapter is for America and not Europe. Also the CE certification is missing on the Adapter and on the Robot. So my last atampt will be Using the documents i got from the creator and hope they are sufficent. If not i want a refund. The Creator was not honest when he said worldwide shipping~Still no information on my Aus shipment which was meant to be in December. ~I have not received any message or item so far. If I do not get any message or item by end of Feb, I am going to take action against Everybot.~I received my Everybot RS700 in Germany. But I'm disappointed, since no invoice/shipping document was attachted -- I had to drive to the customs office to get it (and pay 50 extra bucks)...~They don't even reply my message nor comment. Let me repost this:~Is it start shipping ? Wait too long already~@everybot this is my third or fourth request for information. All I know is my shipping number says my bot is still in Korea. No mail from customs they are holding it and no update or even replies to my earlier requests to you for advice what i should do. Can you at least let me know you’re refunding my purchase for failure to deliver? It’s been more then two months now!~What's the status for those with defective units? A couple of us have mentioned that the sensors do not work~OK. I am now very angry!Your shipping and customer service has been dreadful!You appear now to be selling the product via Amazon with guaranteed delivery dates - yet mine has not arrived. There are 3 options for you. 1. Fulfil my original pledged order anew with tracking and delivery date2. Give me a delivery date for the original order, if it has left Korea, which I suspect it has not3. Refund my pledge in full and without prejudice~Hey @Jaq: Can you share a video of the same in youtube and share a link here, please? We want to see it's performance..~My bot is being literally ""shipped"" from Korea! And as per Korea Post EMS: Delivery to Vietnam, Philippines, India, Bangladesh via surface is 70-90 days. Damn! Expected delivery for my bot in India  turned out to be 14/MAR/2018 - 03/APR/2018. http://www.koreapost.go.kr~help… my everybot simply bump into all my furnitures. any way i can recalibrate it?~@seth geoffrion: Wow that's totally unacceptable brother. I promised I won't back anything from Asia again.~Your package still not arrived since Dec 26, 2017 bro. Would you mind recheck?~Tracking status says: “Expected departure date from the port” since 31st of December! I’m suspecting mine is lost or has not been shipped. Please refund my double pack.~I have not yet received any tracking number. As I see from the other comments you have already shipped to Germany, i.e. to ""my"" country. What is the status?~@Christian: Are you able to release your robot from the customs?~So i went to the german customs yesterday, had to open my package, told them that the Roboter is CE certificated... I even have a mail with all the documents...So on to the Problem, apperantly it is of no use if the CE is not on the charger and the Robot because only if it is the customs can hand it out. An interesting thing is that in the manual is a picture of the charger for european standart with CE certification..~I had tracking number from you end of December: CP 168 203 358 KRThis is still showing as 'expected departure date from the port.  Korea Post EMS'Is it lost or something???~OK. Third time lucky?I mean - this is my third request for information - maybe this time you’ll reply. Failure to reply within 72 hours will result in a further complaint to Kickstarter and lodging a refund via MasterCard for non-supply of goods.

133," The world is there to be explored and robots, whether they fly, drive, sail or dive are an increasingly common means of reaching and documenting remote and exciting locations.We want you to be able to make the best, most capable robots you can imagine without being limited by size and functionality, so we decided to make available two very small, yet extremely capable robot control boards we have been working on.The 640 and ESCAPE boards are both capable of powering 6 independent motors - the 640 board is aimed at DC motors (up to 11v) whilst the ESCAPE board is the smallest board specifically designed to control ESC powered motors.There are a lot of motor controllers currently available that can easily run 2 or 4 motors - powering 6 currently requires using multiple boards and stacking them on top of each other. This takes up valuable space, which some robots simply do not have, and complicates wiring.We wanted to put the power to control 6 independent motors on the smallest boards possible and we think we've managed it.Six is a magical number when it comes to motors - it opens up possibilities and options you just don't have with 4 motors or fewer. With underwater robotics, six motors allows you to create an extremely manoeuvrable diving robot or a 4 wheel drive bottom crawler with an additional 2 vertical motors for stabilisation and lift. For land robots, whilst six motors may sound like overkill, it could mean the difference between making it over a hill or not. Think you can get away with 4 wheel drive or 2 wheel tank tracks? Then why not use the remaining motor drivers to add a stepper motor for a 360 degree scanner or camera mount.Need lights or robotic grippers? We've got you covered - each board has additional servo and / or LED connections - no need to add additional boards or circuitry.The Dark Water Foundation C.I.C. is a UK based Community Interest Company. Our aims are to promote and encourage an interest in underwater research, adventure and exploration through the use of open-source software and technology.We originally designed these boards for our own custom robot builds as part of our upcoming Over and Under Expedition, but as the prototypes progressed we realised that a lot of other people may benefit from their capabilities on the ground and in the air as well.During the design and building stages we created some small prototype robots - these enable us to quickly and easily test new software and hardware functionality without the need to head out onto the water every time, and also show off the capabilities of the boards.        £5,000 : Stickers for All - We'll throw in a set of awesome Dark Water waterproof stickers for you laptop, drone, submarine, etc.. If you backed us on the SUPPORTER sticker reward then will include a little gift just for you - and some more stickers.     £7,000 : Upgradable boards - We'll design and add a method of extending the capabilities of boards so that they can be upgraded with extra sensors at a later date.£15,000 : 9 Degrees of Awesomeness - We'll add a 9DoF IMU (9 Degrees of Freedom Inertial Measurement Unit ) to each board so you'll have instant access to a 3 axis accelerometer, a 3 axis gyroscope and a 3 axis magnetometer - just like they have on quadcopters.Robots should be capable of exploring and heading to places you sometimes can't follow.

 Whilst Bluetooth game controllers, WiFi and infra-red controllers are great and relatively easy to set up, and use, they all have low range limits - some even down to a few meters.

We needed to be able to send our robots further away - yet always have the ability to take control when we needed to. Rather than invent something new, we looked at what other drone and robot builders were using and decided to follow their lead and use Radio Control.Both the 640 and ESCAPE boards have a dedicated CPPM / PPM-SUM header on them to make it as easy as possible to connect and use a Radio Control transmitter and receiver.The 640 (Six for Zero) board is a DC and Stepper motor control board capable of powering 6 independent DC motors (from 2 - 11v) or 3 stepper motors. DC motors are cheap, easy to get and simple to wire up - so you can quickly and easily get a robot up and running. We have developed libraries in Python and C++, and are working on others, to enable you to get your robot moving with minimal effort.   The 640 board also has 2 additional connections for servos or LEDs, so you can add camera mounts, lights or grippers with minimal effort. The ESCAPE (ESC-cape) board was designed to provide a method of using brushless motors rather than the DC motors used with the 640 board. Brushless motors are highly efficient, quiet and fast - they are used in everything from fast radio control cars, to quadcopters, radio control planes, boats and underwater robots.When you feel the need to switch from DC motors to brushless motors we wanted to keep the amount of work required to a minimum. Having to re-write a lot of the code on your robot just to change the method of propulsion seemed like a bit too much work to us - so we tried to keep the API (programming interface) as similar as possible between the two boards.  Each 640 board has:

 Each ESCAPE board has:CPPM (also known as PPM-SUM) stands for ""Combined Pulse Position Modulation"" and is a method of combining 8 channels / signals into a single input. Connecting a CPPM compatible receiver to your control boards allows you to use your Raspberry Pi to read these 8 signals and then use them for whatever operations you want.The first two channels are usually assigned to power and steering, after that you have an additional 6 channels to assign to things like lights, grippers, toggling cameras on and off, etc. RC receivers are already capable of controlling ESC powered motors and steering servos - so why would you want to use a Raspberry Pi to perform the same operation?Whilst using a Pi to control the basics ( power and steering) seems redundant - sometimes you may not want a direct input to output link. Examples where you may want something more complex could include:We've used the 640 board as a surface computer to control a 3 motor and 5 motor Lego underwater robot at the Raspberry Pi birthday party and Edinburgh Mini Maker Faire. We tested a 6 motor, vectored thrust, underwater robot controlled by the 640 board, a Raspberry Pi Zero and game controller at Maker Faire UK. The GrassShark - a ground vehicle with 4 independent DC motors ( shown in the videos above ) is our main test, tank-control based, vehicle. We are using it as a small robot to test control algorithms and sensors for future nautical robots.The Raspberry Pi Buggy is our latest creation. We are using it to test motor drive and servo steering functionality as an alternative to tank control.We wouldn't be where we are today without the brilliant work and openness of others so we decided early on that everything we create will be released as open source as well.All of our hardware designs are released under a Creative Commons Attribution, Share-Alike license and are available over on our GitHub account. We have developed libraries in both Python and C++ for each of the boards, and are working on NodeJS libraries - these are also available via our GitHub repositories. We'll be continuously adding to these, and putting together some tutorials and examples, as we progress through this campaign and afterwards.As both boards share a common API so you should be able to switch methods of propulsion with as few changes to your code as possible.Whilst Raspbian is fine for the majority of robots - when you need rapid processing and control you need to move to something with an element of Real Time processing. Real time Linux is used in quite a few autopilot systems for autonomous drones and quadcopters so we decided to build a version of Raspbian with Real Time capabilities.The kernel source is currently available on our GitHub site for you to download and compile straight away. As this can take a long time - we will be making downloadable images available on our website very soon so you can just write them to your SD card in the same way as you usually install your operating system.We're also a very friendly team - so if you want to know how to do something then you can also find us Twitter. A documentation site and forum will be in place by the end of the campaign for more complex questions and answers.We designed these boards to be the same size as the Raspberry Pi Zero so you can make extremely capable, yet very small robots. Both boards will also work on other Raspberry Pi models as well.If your Raspberry Pi has 40 GPIO pins then both boards will fit with no changes needed - this includes the following:If you will need to use an earlier model Pi (with only 26 GPIO pins) then you can connect a shorter header to your boards instead - the 640 and ESCAPE boards use the 3.3v, 5v, I2C and two extra pins (for the 640 - only 1 for the ESCAPE) which are all in the first 26 pins - earlier models are:Each board will be delivered partly assembled. All of the surface mounted components and chips will be attached but you will need to solder your own headers and connections on.We originally planned on supplying fully assembled boards but after a lot of conversations we came to the conclusion that not everyone needs the same connections as us, or have the same space in their robot chassis.As the Raspberry Pi Zero came without a header attached there was also no guarantee that everyone installed the same ones, so this added an extra complication if we wanted to install female headers on all the boards.When we send out surveys (after a hopefully successful campaign) we'll give you the option to select the header (male or female) and connections (vertical or right angled headers as shown in the pictures, or screw terminals) you want included with your board - so you will be able to set up your board to your specific needs. We've spent over 4 months designing, prototyping and testing both boards. The latest versions of the boards are the ones we plan on sending to production unless we need to make small changes or updates.The 640 board - which was the first one we developed - is currently on the 4th version.The ESCAPE board is on the second version as it is a much simpler board and the design was initially based on the second version of the 640 board.All of our prototypes were manufactured by the wonderful team at Ragworm (as you may already have spotted from the colour). We started trading 18 months ago - a few years after the founders came up with our initial aim and name whilst sitting in a restaurant in Liverpool's Albert Dock looking out over the waters of the River Mersey. We were announced as the recipient of The BLUE Ocean conservation fellowship grant in late 2014 for our Bob autonomous drone project.12 Months ago we designed and developed the Lego ROV and have been running workshops across the UK ( and Ireland ) since then encouraging children of all ages to take a interest in underwater robotics and ocean conservation. This campaign takes us forward a significant step - with your help we can help people create more complex robots to really encourage future underwater robotic engineers, explorers and conservationists to push forward, build awesome things and explore distant places.We plan on putting the most recent versions of our prototypes into production (Mk2 for the ESCAPE board and Mk4 of the 640 board).As soon as the KickStarter funds are released we will finalise the PCB panels (order a test panel), order components and make sure our assemblers are ready to go.We intend the order for PCBs to be sent within 4 weeks of the funds arriving - allowing for delays if we need to factor in test runs for stretch goals.Assembly will commence as soon as the PCBs are ready.Factoring in postage delays, we hope to be shipping orders within 8 weeks of the funds being released.If there are any delays then we will, of course, notify our backers as soon as possible.Stretch goals may increase these time-scales - but you will be getting something even cooler for a small delay.",Barry Getty,"£5,814",Unstated,Compact and powerful open source robot controllers that fit perfectly on your Raspberry Pi Zero.

137," Welcome and thank you for spending the time to view our Kick-starter page. It means a lot and we at 4286 Imperial Robotics (the FIRST order)  hope that this is the beginning of your support of our FIRST robotics competition and engineering endeavors.       We are a small high school robotics team based out of Lee Davis High School in Mechanicsville, Virginia. Our team is about 20 members, mostly freshmen and sophomores interested in learning how to build robots. We’ve existed for about five years and are previously known as C-FEDS (Club For Engineering Droyds), but are now beginning to build our own identity separate from the Lee Davis Confederates. We are the 4286th FIRST robotics team in existence, and we compete within the Chesapeake regional. But More than the facts, Imperial robotics is a community of high school kids interested in creating something bigger than themselves. We gather together not only to learn and hone new problem solving skills, but to take in new members and spread the joy of engineering to a younger generation (aka: middle school students). And of course have a lot of fun doing it!  A Brief History:     Imperial Robotics was founded 4 years ago by Parker Stevens, an ex member of another FIRST team. He and many others built up the program at Lee Davis and since then have been wildly successful. Despite low amounts of funding we have managed to compete decently in all of our events. in 2015 we ranked 38th out of 64 in the Virginia Regional, 2014 we ranked 29th out of 64, in 2013 28th out of 65, and in 2012 30th out of 59. Our coach has always been Thomas Riley, our school’s computer automated design teacher, and his time and effort has allowed us to meet for these four years.     Founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen, FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a non-profit organization which hosts various competitions for 6 to 18 year old students. FIRST competitions change based on the level at which the teams are competing. For instance FLL (FIRST Lego League) teams of people from grades 4 to 8 make robots using Lego Mindstorms kits and also provide some creative solutions to a real life problem. For instance recycling or energy consumption.    Imperial Robotics competes at the FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) level in which each team is given a kit of parts which will be necessary in building a robot to compete in a themed challenge. This year’s challenge is called “Stronghold” however until January 9th  no robotics team will know the nature of the challenge. Often the challenges are sports related and in the past have included Frisbee golf, basketball, and soccer.     However FIRST isn’t just about providing teams with the ability to learn how to design, build, CAD model, market, and program a robot (and team), nor is it about the 800+ scholarship opportunities it offers to it’s college bound alumni. It’s main function is to spread the concepts of gracious professionalism and coopertition. Gracious professionalism is the convergence of high quality work and respecting the values of others. It works together with coopertition, the idea that teams should work together just as much as they compete. Together this builds the community we know as FIRST robotics. “FIRST is more the robots. Robots are a vehicle for students to learn important life skills.”- Dean Kamen 
  Honestly building robots costs a lot of money, as do competitions. In order to support the team through travel expenses, competition entry fees, purchasing kits of parts, purchasing spare parts, team image paraphernalia and other necessary purchases we need YOUR help. With the assistance of each cent you can spare us we can get to competition and keep spreading the joy of engineering and of course, each donation will bring a reward and access to our updates for backers. As far as we are concerned, once you donate you’re part of the team. But if you’re still on the fence, then let’s show you where your money is going.  Budget:
Notice: the FRC World competition and Chesapeake finals will only be expenses if we win a slot during the qualifying and finals respectively. This is how much they would cost without fees for travel and hotels. Simply put our primary goal is currently to increase our tool supply, as buying new socket wrenches and other equipment is necessary for this years build however there are a lot of major goals, mostly directly from of our budgeting list above. Goal: at $275 for New Socket Wrenches and other toolsStretch Goal 1: at $825 for Travel and Hotel expenses for the team at

140," Robotics is the most multidisciplinary field in engineering. It encompasses everything from electronics to neuroscience, helping to prepare students for any number of careers in the STEM fields. But this breadth is not always obvious, or interesting, especially to kids who are just getting started. So we created a robot that is different from any other. It let's kids see that entirely new ""creatures"" can be created with robotics and technology that do not exist. They can see that they don't have to be limited by biology, or even past engineering, they can create things that are entirely new with robotics.We wanted to show kids that robots can be something completely new and exciting.What Kids Can Learn from the CritterThe Critter is the fifth robot in the LittleBot family of 3D printed arduino robots. We had already made arms and wheeled robots, we knew that with the next one we wanted a walking robot. But while creating the new walking robot we had to ensure that we met the same quality of design for easy assembly that we established with all of our other kits.WalkingWalking robots are generally pretty complex. They generally require a lot of calibration, precision, and special programming to operate effectively. When we decided to build a walking robot we knew that it couldn't be a traditional system. We needed something that was easy and rugged enough for kids to build while still being interesting enough for hobbyists at higher levels.We took a little inspiration from mudskippers and the first animals to crawl out of the ocean. We knew that it would be a belly-dragger, and that is where the similarity ended.The LittleBot uses its two front legs to drag itself along. This gives it many of the capabilities of walking robots, such as traversing difficult terrains, while not having the downsides (falling over when a program is bad). This lets new roboticists experiment with code without having to worry about damaging the robot as much.Easy to BuildSince we simplified how the walking was to be done we were able to use many of the standards we created with our previous kits. The Legs themselves only have 8 screws (4 apiece), and since we design for 3D printing a large majority of makers and schools can build the kits from scratch without a great deal of difficulty.The electronics of the Critter are based around the Meped board. This custom PCB allows simple connection of bluetooth, sensors and even wifi. The board greatly reduces the complexity of  the electronics. Instead of having to go through complicated circuit diagrams it is basically just plug and play. Using this board within a few minutes you have a robot that can see the world with its ultrasonic eyes and start moving.Every single plastic part on the Critter is 3D printed. Since we designed it this way there are only 6 3D printed parts in the Kit and less than 2 dozen parts total (not counting the 12 screws). Making the Critter 3D printed ensured that anyone can build one anywhere in the world to take advantage of what it can offer.The other advantage of 3D printing is that students can change and add to it. We will be releasing details of the Critter design so that kids can design new features like feet for his legs that provide different amounts of traction, or even extra sensors added to his shell.Easy to ReprogramSince the Critter is a based entirely on Arduino its code is very well supported. We work to post tutorials and explanations of the code on each of our robot kits. And the wider Arduino community provides resources and tutorials on basic programming concepts.Additionally, since the Critter uses Arduino it can be programmed with graphic programming tools such as Scratch and Blockly, reducing the stress on new programmers to learn syntax.Just Fun to Play WithThe Critter can be operated with an Android app that we have created. The app allows for ""driving"" the Critter around, activating ""Autonomous Wander Mode,"" (where they Critter uses his eyes and various internal behaviors to wander) and executing various motions such as waving and dancing. If we exceed our initial goal for the campaign we will add a ""Training App"" where you will be able to use bluetooth and USB to teach the Critter your own motions, much as we have implemented with the LittleArms.Maker KitIf you have a 3D printer and would like to make those parts yourself go right ahead. We will send you all the other parts and the 3D printing files.Full KitEverything you need to build a full Critter. You just provide the batteriesDeveloper KitThe Full Kit with a few extras (assembly required). We added the Developer Kit for those that intend to spend a lot of time reprogramming and adding to the Critter. The Power Supply allows you to keep his servos powered as you program different gaits and behaviors. The extra breadboards give you the electrical space you might need to add other sensors and peripherals. Assembled KitAssembled and ready to go.

142," Please note that the Early Bird reward will be delivered in December 2015 not 2016 as listed.  We've added a second reward with this corrected but we're aiming to ship all early bird rewards in December 2015.Ohbot2 is a robot head that helps children to learn programming and computational thinking.  You can choose to have one fully constructed or as a kit that you put together yourself.It has seven servo motors:It has graphical programming software that allows children to program it to move, speak, 'see' faces and 'hear' spoken words. See program examples.Since we launched Ohbot1 in March 2015 we have delivered hundreds of robots to children, teachers, academics and enthusiasts across the world. Ohbot1 generated a lot of excitement. Children immediately engaged with the idea of a robot head that they can program to tell stories, greet school visitors or to boss adults around.Through a partnership with the University of South Wales, we sent Ohbots on working holidays to primary and secondary schools in Wales to help us establish how Ohbot would support learning in computer science and programming. Children programmed their robots to do useful work around their schools ""I've learnt to program robots to make them like they're a real human which was hard"" one young roboticist reflected on the experience of programming Ohbots. See the ITN report on the project here.Ohbots also took part in the BBC's Make it Digital tour. See this BBC News report.Feedback on Ohbot1 has helped us to understand the potential of Ohbot as a fun learning tool, and as a sibling to the floor turtle in primary education.""The only robot I have seen that might introduce artificial intelligence ideas in primary."" Helen Caldwell, University of Northampton""I think the best thing about the Ohbot is that it is a suitably challenging progression for kids to move on from Scratch - a real gap in the market at the moment. The interface will be familiar to pupils but they will then need to think about controlling and timing the motors to make a real robot move and speak!""  DigitalKatieProfessor Adrian Oldknow of the National Stem Centre on Ohbot.You can read all about the story so far on www.ohbot.co.uk or on Twitter @OhbotRobotOur campaign is to make a new version of Ohbot. Currently it takes a long time for us to produce all the parts. We've also found that assembling Ohbot from a kit of parts is time consuming.So we have teamed up with a local company to make Ohbot2 using injection moulded parts. This will make the robot much easier to assemble for the people who buy it as a kit and also reduce the time it takes us to make parts.We have all of the design finished and prototyped with 3D prints but the moulds are very expensive to make. We need total pledges of £10,000 in order to bring our designs off the screen and into the real world.We are also taking the opportunity to make Ohbot even better so it will have:A new controller board will allow additional sensors and servos to be added. It will also make the power supply connection more reliable. Arduino enthusiasts have the option to write code to run on it directly, without the need for a PC to be attached.A more expressive mouth, controlled by an extra motor allows Ohbot to look sad and most importantly happy!New eyelids which cover the top of the eyeballs to show a greater range of emotional expression.Improved software will include exciting new blocks such as one that allows Ohbot to respond to live data from Wikipedia. We will try our hardest to ship the first 100 kits within four weeks of the close of the campaign so that they are delivered in time for December holidays.

Click to Tweet!mePed is an awesome little open source quadruped robot which allows anyone to build their very own walking robot with no prior knowledge in robotics at a price point that almost anyone can afford.  The mePed is targeted towards beginners as well as more advanced makers.  Out of the box, the mePed is pre-programmed with a simple set of commands that allow you to make the robot move around the room, wave, and dance.  With a little bit of extra programming, you can make the mePed navigate mazes, avoid obstacles, or anything else you can imagine.  Everything about the mePed is open source so you can hack it, remix it, and reprogram it to make it unique and your own!Our goal for mePed is to bring the price of the kit down low enough so that anyone can build a programmable walking robot for under $100.  Most comparable robot kits cost $200 or more and are closed source.  By supporting our Kickstarter campaign you are helping us increase our buying power by enabling us to buy components in large quantities, thus receiving deeper discounts on the parts that make up the mePed. We will pass those discounts on to all of our backers and future customers.The mePed v2.0 kit will include everything needed to assemble and start having fun with your very own mePed Quadruped Robot!  From the high quality MDF wood pieces and fasteners that make up the body of the mePed to the custom printed circuit board, pre-programmed Arduino Nano Compatible controller, Ultrasonic Range Sensor, and IR Remote Control.  You'll even get the hex and end wrenches needed to tighten the nuts and bolts.  Just add 4AA batteries and you'll be up and running!In addition to running 8 servos and controlling the mePed with an IR Remote, we have also added BlueTooth and I2C ports to the circuit board for more communication options.  All unused pins from the Arduino Compatible controller have also been broken out in a pin header for adding more sensors and other components.The mePed robot is completely open source, from the hardware files needed to build the structure to the electronics and software.  The mePed v1.0 hardware and software files can already be found on our website: www.meped.io.  The source files for mePed v2.0 will be released after this Kickstarter campaign is completed.Since the mePed is open source, you can easily reprogram it, hack it, add new sensors, or even change the design of the body and 3D print it!  In early 2015 I ran across the open source meArm robot project on Thingiverse.com and I built one for myself.  After a little while, I realized that there weren't many places to purchase a meArm kit in the USA.   I began selling meArms online and after a couple months, I wanted to give back to the open source community by creating my own open source robot.  Using a couple components from the meArm and some of the design concepts, I set out to build the first mePed robot. With the permission of Ben Gray, the designer of the meArm, I settled on the name mePed because parts of the walking robot were borrowed from the open source meArm! I have been selling a partial kit of mePed v1.0 for nearly a year now.  This partial kit contains the mePed body, 8 servos, and the nuts and bolts required to assemble the main structure but no electronics.  The end user was required to supply their own circuit board, micro controller, and supporting sensors. Fast forward to May, 2016, I have redesigned parts of the mePed to increase the strength of the legs, reduce torque on the servos, improve the visual appeal of the robot, and added mounting holes for various components such as the new PCB and a battery holder.   I have also designed and ran a couple small batches of PCBs for the mePed, refining the PCB layout and features along the way.",Scott Pierce,"$8,224",Unstated,Build your own four legged friend with this easy robot kit!

The goal is to help everyone build a feature-rich robot without all the messy wiring. You simply connect the motors, plug in the sensors and controller and you may start programming. We even provide sample programs to help you get started.In addition, a free Android app will be developed once we hit our stretch goal of $10000. With the app, even kids can navigate the robot with a smart phone or tablet.Not into robotics? You can use this as a platform to build your Arduino based IoT (Internet of Things) devices as well.If you want to know, please refer to the bottom of this page.It is the main PCB that connects everything in the kit. There are many holes on the edges for you to mount the motors and sensors. You may also mount it to other chassis using standard screws and standoffs. Note: Final design may vary from this picture slightly. For example, color, component placement, pinout and etc. may change.Speedy Hackabot Nano: This is a 2-wheel-drive version of the robot. The motors run up to 150rpm. Flat and smooth surface is ideal for this robot. For example, you may turn it into a maze robot or even line following robot if you add proper sensors.Fully Loaded Hackabot Nano: This has all the features listed in the ""Key Features"" section. You may choose either high speed or high torque motors. With the latter, the robot will be able to travel uneven surfaces. However, it will not run as fast. You may turn it into many different robots. For example, you may control it over the internet. You may ask it to go to a specific location based on GPS readings. With Radio Frequency (RF) module, each robot is able to communicate up to 5 other robots. You may create a robot team to solve problems as a group. Isn't it fun?It is very simple to assemble Hackabot Nano. All you need is a screw driver. No soldering is required. Since the controller is Arduino Nano compatible, there is a large community supporting you. You simply download the software (IDE) from http://arduino.cc and you will be ready to start.The programming language is C. There are tons of libraries and examples for your controller and sensors. In addition, tutorials for Hackabot Nano will be posted on http://www.HackARobot.com in the near future.In addition, you may also program it through graphical programming interface. If time permits, we will customize minibloq to give you such capability.  According to WikiPedia : ""It's widely used in Argentina, where just in the San Luis province, more than 60000 children has been trained with this software in public schools"". Here is an example of minibloq: With two powerful on-board voltage regulators, it is possible to power Raspberry Pi single board computer through Fabric Shield. It only takes 4 wires (5V, GND, TX and RX) to create a serial link to Raspberry Pi.With Raspberry Pi, you may connect to camera and use computer vision to navigate your robot.Alternatively, 5V power could be delivered through the audio jack and a USB adapter. (I could even charge my phone or tablet with that).Instead of driving DC motors, it is possible to drive four servo motors. How about building a bipedal robot? How about building a self-balancing robot ? The picture below shows that it is possible to connect a temperature and humidity sensor directly to Fabric Shield. It wouldn't be difficult make it a WiFi connected temperature logger.A few months ago, I started a Meetup group for robotics ( without knowing anything about robotics). I was just dreaming about building an intelligent robot and a robot football league. I created my first robot (called Hackabot Uno), which is based on Arduino Uno and standard off-the-shelf components. I even sold quite a few kits to my members.I quickly realized that wiring is a big problem. The robot consists of almost 100 wires even before I added all the features (like GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth and etc.). This is pretty much how most of the DIY robots look like on youtube. With over 20 years of circuit design experience, I know it is easy for me to create a PCB. My goal is to take care of the wiring so that everyone can build a compact and feature-rich robot. I created a couple of prototypes and hope to use Kickstarter to make it more affordable. Tags:Arduino Robot, Robotic Kit, Gyroscope, GPS, DIY, Robotics, Arduino Nano, NRF24L01, WiFi, ESP8266, Bluetooth, IoT, Home Automation, MPU 6050, InvenSense, Nordic Semiconductor, SLAM, Ultronsonic Distance Sensor, Arduino Sensor, HC-SR04, L293D, Motor Driver, PWM, Accelerometer, Audio, USB power, Raspberry Pi, charger, AVR, Atmel",Funnyvale,"$6,445",Unstated,Anyone can build a robot quickly with this kit.

Does it require certain apps to perform this functionality? If so, are these apps already built-in to BIG-i or do they need to be installed seperately by the owner? How does the robot know its way around the house? Is this programmed or does it just learn paths from moving around? What if, for example, it needs to get to the kitchen and there are obstacles like toys scattered around or maybe a new sofa in the living room. Will it know how to get around these obstacles and still know the way to the kitchen? Will the robot be able to travel on tile (non-smooth surface) or carpet? Is its speed of movement adjustable (faster or slower)? How about it's voice? Can the volume be adjusted? If the robot tips over, are there mechanisms in place to allow it to notify someone to pick back up, or does it shut itself off? What if it is a very hot day with no one around in the house? Is there a possibility that BIG-i could overheat? If so, are there mechanisms in place to allow it to regulate itself in such cases like turning itself off? (Sorry for all the questions...just want to know all aspects of the robot's usage). Thanks for the information.~Will you constantly add new features and services to Big-i?

146,"  Robotic arms no longer belong only to Sci-Fi movies or automotive factories. In fact, they have become part of daily life for makers, hobbyists and businesses. However until now, collaborative robotic arms with industrial level accuracy and professional quality have been prohibitively expensive. That's why we want to make a difference by introducing Z-Arm!          Z-Arm is a desktop workstation robotic arm with incredible repeatable accuracy, durability and built-in safety features for makers, business owners, or anyone with an interest in robotics. It is incredibly versatile and can be equipped to deal with a nearly unlimited number of tasks, including cutting, 3D printing, soldering, parts assembly and more.               With interchangeable heads, you can reply on Z-Arm for many tasks. Here are a few examples of how Z-Arm can help you to build and create.                               With 0.02mm precision, a velocity of 430 degrees per second, 2kg workload and 400mm maximum reach, Z-Arm makes a perfect desktop workstation. Besides those incredible specs and great price, Z-Arm is also the first collaborative robotic arm designed for individual users. Collaborative robotics are designed with safety features to work in conjunction with humans. These features are essential for a safe work space and creating efficient collaborative processes.           In spite of its compact all-metal-body, Z-Arm has an incredibly large working area thanks to its 3rd arm that has a complete 360-degree reach. This makes it more useful and creates more versatility for a wide variety of different tasks.       We also designed a electric gripper which can perform tasks requiring a lot of precision.                   One of the biggest problems with the robotic arms that exist on the market today is the complexity of using them. They often require a high degree of programming knowledge or an intimate understanding of proprietary systems.We wanted to change all that and make robotics easy enough for anyone to use. We designed Z-Arm with simple App controls. You can get started in seconds with a user-friendly smartphone App that makes working with Z-Arm simple. To make it even easier, we also added an important Handhold Teaching feature to Z-Arm, giving users the ability to program repeatable actions by hand-guiding the position of the arms manually, a great timesaver!       For 3D printer, we will provide a software on PC which could translate G-code to Z-Arm via Ethernet.For laser engraving and cutting, we will also provide a software on PC and phone/pad, just input the picture, you will get the engraving/cuttting results on your selected materails.And also we will provide all core library files to backers, it is free, like .dll(Windows platform), .jar(android platform), you can use these files to develop your own 3D software/Laser engraving and cutting software or other application software, you don't need to care about how to control robot motion, just focus on the applications you wantAfter pledge, feel free to contact us when you need APIs descriptions, and we are opened to discuss with you about the APIs definition, let's know what you think, we are looking forward to your ideas which make our products better    Building a tool as advanced as Hitbot requires a lot of dedicated work and testing. We have applied our many years of experience in the automation field and taken the time necessary to develop the most user-friendly, precise and reliable robotic arm possible.                                                        With 0.02mm Precision & 2kg Workload            ",HITBOT,"$116,530",Unstated,"Easily use, open to DIY.

Will this drill head will be delivered when I at a drill head or the old one you have before?~How about CNC?~Hi Daisy,~Sorry Daisy, you are right. I found it in the junk emails. Yes the materials and tools are what I mean. Thanks for testing it!~Dear Daisy, i have not recived this pictures. I only get this email: OK, now is the midnight in China, I will send to you tomorrow. Thank you so much! Daisy Hu~The object in the video has the same size like the object on the photo. So this means you but a printed object under the z-arm and make people believe the arm printed it. If the printer is not working yet you should have write 3D printing in progress into the campaign. But if you could show me a timelapse of this print or a video of the z-arm printing a few layers i will be convinced that this future exists. Otherwise i am out~The picture of the 3D print is the same object as the one in the video of your campaign. I have watched the video again and recognized how short the clips of the print are. Is this part printed with the arm or is it printed with another 3D printer and the arm is only teached in to follow the contour for a few seconds without printing anything. Please post a timelapse of the whole print process or at lest the print of a few layers.~Hi @creator,~@creatorI just read through the comment, l also concerns the same problem. Hope you would upload a video before the last 24 hour.~@Daisy, that sounds great. Why don’t you post the results in an update? This seems to be very interesting for backers, and maybe it will also bring you some new backers. If it works you should also attach some pictures to your campaign. This will be an awesome feature for the z-arm~@Daisy gripper of tool head should be able to grip: 1-3mm to be able to use miniature standard tools like this one: https://www.amazon.de/gp/aw/d/B013P10K50/ref=mp_s_a_1_31… so we could work on materials like: Wood, acrylic, acrylic glass, and maybe aluminum~@daisy, will the gripper of the drill head be increased or is it still 0.7 -1.5mm? It seems that there are no updates for a long time, and you are still loosing backers. Why don,t you bring updates and show your backers that this campaign is still alive~@Rizban, yes it isn‘t at the moment, so it should be changed. The drill heads aren’t produced right now, as the campaign is still running. And HITBOT will reach more backers if they have this feature. The drill head is specified with this usages: drilling, polishing, grinding, cleaning,... where could you buy a polishing head with a shaft diameter of 0,7 - 1,5mm and how do you polish different materials without a variable speed? The same applies for grinding. I have backed this project because I wan,t a useful robotic arm, I  don‘t pay $ 2.000 (with Tool heads) and also custom taxes will follow (at least $ 400,-) and in the end the only thing the drill head could drill is a 1.5mm hole~@Florian: Right, but the given specs don't say whether or not the current drill head has a variable RPM. Until told it is variable, I would assume it has only one speed. Fixed speed and small tool shank makes it unsuitable.~@Rizban, yes you are right. The most of this machines go up to 10.000 but the needed rpm speed is always depending on the processed material. Maybe the 8500 rpm of the z-arm drill head are enough for some materials. I think for the most wood materials and plastic and also acrylic materials 8500 rpm are enough. Wood will be burn and get black on a to high rotation speed and plastics will melt and smear up the tool. But as mentioned earlier a gripper of 0.7 - 1.5mm for drills and tools is to small. A diameter from 0.7 - 3mm makes more sense, so everyone coul buy drills, polishing heads and all the other stuff who is available on Amazon and hardware stores for handheld tools like dremel~@Florian: This is just a guess, but I think the reason the drilling head can't do CNC carving is because of the lower RPM speed and small shank diameter. Most CNC machines I've seen go to 10000 RPM or higher and have a gripper size of 2.5 mm or higher. The slower speed is acceptable for drilling but doesn't work well for carving most materials. The small shank size means a very small tool size and would also be more likely to break from the extended period of stress from carving.~@John LaRavia: Mooz is a knock off version of Snapmaker, which funded back in April. Last I heard, Snapmaker was looking into legal action against Mooz.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/snapmaker/snapmaker-the-all-metal-3d-printer~I don‘t want to be anoying, but why is carving not possible at the moment? The software should not be the problem, it is the same as for 3D printing, only inverted. And after choosing the size of the tool head the software could easily generate a gcode file with the recommended settings for the tool head like move speed and z height of every step. Is the force of the axis not high enough for carving or is the drill head not stable enough?~And you should also bring some updates and keep the backers up to date. I have seen that you have lost two backers since yesterday, the amount of available super early birds ,which i also choosed was 0 yesterday and today there are 2 available. Maybe detailed pictures and videos of 3d printing and laser engraving would be interresting for us backers~Sorry mi failure, I want to write Daisy~Thanks for the response Dasisy. The reason i am asking for carving is that there are also campaigns for small cnc carving and milling machines on Kickstarter. Making the z-arm compatible to carving will be a huge benefit for your campaign, making it interresting for everyone who is searching for such a device. Even if there is not much time left.Is it correct that the drill head could only gripp tools from 0,7 - 1,5mm? Or is that a failure? If this is correct this is an extremly small diameter. Small tools for hand held machines like dremel have a diameter of 2,4 - 3mm. So none of them would fit...~@creator: the Z-arm looks amazing, and I also see that it can do 3D printing and laser engraving, which picks my interest. I understand that obviously a robotic arm is a lot more expensive than a 3D printer, I am trying to pick what's best for me. And I saw this Mooz project, which also can do 3D printing, CNC carving and laser engraving, so I would like to know in terms of 3D printing and laser engraving, what is the difference between Z-arm and Mooz, thank you. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1563123582/mooz-industrial-grade-transformable-metallic-3d-pr~After exchanging a few mails with the creator, I gave some feedback on October 1st and never got an answer back. Seeing how the campaign is not updated unfortunately does not inspire confidence, and thus I will reduce my pledge for now to $1.I think this could be a really cool robot arm but for that price I do expect an awesome campaign effort.Good luck all, Cheers~Could the drilling head also be used for carving? And is the 4 thaxis and the electric gripper also hand teachable?~Coul you upload a high quality picture of a 3D printed part? I want to have a closer look to the print quality. What is the maximum print height with the print head mounted on the z-arm? You mentioned that the 4 axis is only needed for complex prints but all the movements of the print head could also be done with the two existing arms. So why is there a need for the 4 axis when printing complex parts?~@CreatorCan you post more information about Solderpaste/Glue/Liquid Dispensing?Because I would buying it just for this feature.For this tool, what would be include other than needle, any picture?If possible, please post a video with Solderpaste head with glue as material.I would like to see if this would help me...Also, for software, does it tells how much liquid to drop, hold back the liquid, and move the head to next position?~@Michael Sbarra. it is a very good idea. We will have a try to plan, please give us a little bit of time, we will get back to you soon.Daisy HuHitBot~Are there any plans to offer a t-shirt reward?

147," We are back on Kickstarter to fund the Easy Drone XL Pro - our newest addition to the Easy Drone family. Last year when we launched our Easy Drone series here on KickStarter we gained a lot of happy customers worldwide. They helped us tremendously test and improve our modular design and provided invaluable feedback.Well first off, it can stay in the air for 45 minutes on one battery charge. Unheard of right? We thought so.It spans an amazing 28 inches (700mm) from motor to motor diagonally, in comparison the original DJI Phantom has 14 in (350mm) span. You do the math. Even though it's twice the size it fits in the same backpack as a 350mm frame including the remote, the battery, charger, etc., with room to spare.Easy Drone XL Pro can easily lift a mirrorless back camera on a gimbal with combined weight of up to 3 lbs (1.4 Kg). Check below for a list of example cameras you could use. Same modular design - Easy Drone XL Pro has the same modular design as the previous versions L and XL that allows it to fit into the same size backpack. Same Control Unit - Even though the new Fly Bot has some new and upgraded features it is still backwards compatible with all our previous frame versions. Same goes for our previous FlyBots - they can be used with the new frame with a simple wireless profile update.Same Travel Backpack - The XL Pro still fits in the same backpack that pack the L and XL. If you happen to own one of our previous versions all you need is a custom insert for XL Pro. Other GoPro drones? Even though our quadcopter is twice the size, it still fits in the same travel case as these other ones available for purchase in stores. Flight times comparison:Now, if you just wanted to put your fave mirrorless-back camera (or anything larger then a GoPro) up in the sky, these would be your options. Professional Camera Drones:The $1 reward is often under appreciated, but we see it as an equivalent of a tap on the back and a friendly ""Good job guys! I like what you're doing here...""T-shirt has our logo and the tagline. It's not too flashy or prominent, but definitely a conversation starter.  All our reward packages are Ready-To-Fly, which means they come with a remote, battery, charger, telemetry dongle and video receiver.If you want to maximize your flight time with a GoPro camera on a gimbal pledge $2195 or more and we will reward you with an endurance kit like this that stays up in the air for up to 45 minutes!If you'd like to use a camera larger than a GoPro and have a video screen that mounts on the remote this is the perfect kit for you. What is included in an Easy Drone XL Pro Kit:Easy Drone XL Pro can carry a GoPro camera for an amazing 45 minutes while streaming video to the screen on the ground. As the weight increases the flight time shortens. Here is a table of the impressive XL Pro airtimes with some common configurations: FlyBot- 4x 30A ESC's - 915Mhz (US) or 433Mhz (Europe) telemetry- 5.8 Ghz Video link- 2.4 Ghz Radio controllerFrame- 28 in (700mm) diagonal- 400 KV motors- 15 in folding propsEasy Drone XL Pro can lift up to 3 lbs of weight. Recommended weight for flight is up to 2.2 pounds combined (gimbal+camera). Here are some of the cameras that fit this profile: January 2015 - Frame expansion - maximizing frame sizeMarch 2015 - Battery testing - finding the largest battery for the frameMay 2015 - Motor and prop matching - best performing combinationJuly 2015 - Flight length testingAugust 2015 - New backpack insert designYou are probably wondering why are we back on Kickstarter and the answer is two-fold. One reason is that we need to reach a certain number of units to be able to negotiate better prices with vendors and then pass them on to you in the form of KickStarter only, low pricing. More importantly though this is where our most involved audience is. The biggest reward we received last time was the feedback from our supporters. It allowed us to iterate and improve until we reached the final solution. In return we gave everyone a free upgrade to the latest version of our previous drone. About the same time we launched last year, there were a few other drones that kickstarted their campaigns. More then a year later this is the outcome so far: This is NOT a toy. Improper handling and not following proper procedures can result in a serious injury. Always have your own and  safety of others on your mind when piloting. Avoid flying in public places and always comply with your local laws and regulations. Easy Aerial team includes four talented young engineers with shared passion for robotics and flying machines. Here we are a year later. We spent it improving and testing, optimizing and expanding, but most importantly making sure our supporters are getting the best possible support wherever they are in the world. We are ready to present to you the Easy Drone XL Pro our latest modular quadcopter. ",Ivan Stamatovski,"$38,500",Unstated,Three times more air time then any other quad.

148," Kids & robots go together like Penn & Teller or Tom & Jerry - there’s a magic mix of fun & mayhem - no child should go without the chance to create & learn.Our smartphone society talks about affordability but in reality, most robot kits are out of reach of the many. Any kit that could pay for a weeks groceries for a family of four is not affordable.How about a simple, robust, fully programmable, expandable, open source robot design that costs under £10 / $12 / €11?What could be done with that? At that price level, parents can take a chance on trying it out. Schools can equip a whole classroom for the same price as one high end kit.Sure, it’s not all brushed aluminium. Do the kids care? Nope. Do they learn just as much? Sure! And there’s pocket money accessories that they can buy to expand on their kit to do more.Our local school were using ‘affordable’ robots - but not one student had one at home, which at £60 / $73 / €66, was asking a bit much. No parent wants to buy a kit they don’t understand and see it stuck in the drawer from day one.So in the summer of 2015 Nick started prototyping and went out to Maker Faires and schools to show them what could be built on a budget. Nick created some supporting components and started on a website.Which is where we are today. You can go to http://chickbot.club right now, download the parts lists, plans and code, order the components on eBay and make your own robot for the target price. We support Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the BBC micro:bit.For convenience & peace of mind, people have been asking us for complete kits. Which opened up some possibilities. Some want to buy a complete ‘retail’ kit. Clubs & schools want to buy a bulk pack of everything and do some light soldering. Some just want the driver board PCB’s and get the parts themselves.To get the stock in and, pardon the pun, kickstart the project, here we are. We’d like to spread the word so we can make the full kits as affordable as possible. And then we’d like to expand on the capabilities - a Blocky programming tool, a phone & tablet app and some high end facilities for the Raspberry Pi version - Robotics Operating System support & OpenCV vision. Note, these are not part of the rewards, these are future plans.The reward packs start out with the basic robot kits and build on each other providing more and more activities. All the accessories have supporting documentation on the website.Depending on the reward, you chose which programmable thingy-ma-bob you want your kit to use:BBC micro:bit - a simple controller released by the BBC April 2016. Take up is mostly in the UK but you can order them from anywhere in the world from a variety of UK based online retails. The micro:bit costs around £13. We think it's a great way for 5 - 13 year olds to get started &/or if you don't have much programming experience yourself.Arduino - the go-to microcontroller platform of choice for Makers the world over. It's got plenty of input-output connections and is easy to manage. Mostly it is programmed in a text based language called C - we've added a layer to this to make it obvious what commands you are asking it to do. This is our recommendation for those learning Computer Science or Technology/Engineering aged 13 to 16 who are new to physical computing.Raspberry Pi - the amazing full blown computer with the added bonus of plenty of input-output connections. You can use all sorts of programming languages and hook your ChickBot up to the internet in double quick time. Because it is a full computer, it's not so keen on having its power pulled out from under it, so we recommend some experience of caring for your Pi for younger users before setting out with this option.You'll see that the Raspberry Pi isn't available for pre-Christmas rewards. We are on our second beta of the PCB design & layout. We have chosen not to make our board a HAT as it wouldn't share the common components we use that help keep the costs down.Studying CS or engineering 16+For those studying Computer Science or an engineering topic aged 16 - 19, get an Arduino kit to start out, get a Raspberry Pi and the Pi driver board for the best of both worlds.All programming resources are free to download from the internet and you don't need to be online to use them.Different kits, different motors ...For the Arduino or Raspberry Pi base kit we use stepper motors - slower but more accurate, allowing a wider range of out-of-the-box activities. The Raspberry Pi kit does not include a Pi. The Arduino version includes an Arduino Nano. These kits can be upgraded to using the more spritely Little Yellow Motors.For the BBC micro:bit base kit which is a much simpler microcontroller with fewer output pins, we only offer the Little Yellow Motors. Kit does not include a micro:bit.Common components & upgradesMany of the parts are common to each kit - the main variation is the different motors, but each controller does have its own specific driver board. Even then, there is a lot of overlap between the parts for the driver boards. This way you can start out with one kit and update / upgrade as you go without having to throw it all away and start again. Break anything and replacement parts are easily obtained from many online retailers.Kit contentsEach kit comes complete to build the robots as shown, but does not include the 4 x AA batteries to power them. They all work fine on rechargeable batteries. You will need a pair of scissors to trim the cable ties.The Robot sensor kitPair of line following sensors - for all line following activities or as proximity sensors.Ultrasonic distance sensor - a standard range measuring accessoryInfra-red remote & receiver - allows you to control your ChickBot or give it a sequence of movements to perform.Pair of light sensors - search out the brightest or darkest part of the room or follow a flashlight.The Little Yellow Motors expansion kitTwo yellow motors + driver chip - a different motor set for the Arduino or Pi kits - more speed, less control.The Arduino & Pi driver boards have two sockets. They come with the stepper motor driver chip ULN2803 already inserted. To swap over to using Little Yellow Motors, remove the ULN2803 and put the L293D in to it's socket. You can't run both at once.The Programming activities kitLED ""Knight Rider"" strip - use it to make simple games or display level information.Road junction with pedestrian crossing - one of the classic programming tasks - write code to control traffic lights, we've added a crossing to expand on the fun.7 Segment display - more than just numbers, simple games are possible, status indicator and moreWater/touch sensor - can be used for plant monitoring or as a touch switch.Water pump - working along side the water sensor, you can automatically water your plants, or your younger brother.Temperature sensor - a precision analog temp. sensor with a range from -50 to +125°CPotentiometer (volume) control - an analog input to set settings or levelsGiven the design price for ChickBot, this is not going to make anyone rich anytime ever. So we need to build up production levels without disrupting the work that pays the bills. Hence the modest Kickstarter goal. If we sail straight through the goal, we'll add another batch of rewards with appropriate shipping dates.Many many friends, family & colleagues have said we should go commerical on this project. This would entirely defeat the whole point which is to make a complete functional robot cost accessible to individuals & schools. To turn this into a business, the kit would have to cost around £25 / $28 / €27 plus sales tax. And we'd then end up with yet another me too robot on the market. Which would sell modest amounts and not make anyone rich. And loads of kids wouldn't have access to a their own maker platform to develop their STEM skills with real experience. No karma in that, just total lose lose lose for everyone.In the medium term we are hoping that Makerspaces, schools & budding entrepreneurs put together kits for sale as a side job for those that don't want to DIY. For schools, they could buy in the parts for 100 kits, keep half, sell half and, because they've used volunteer labour for production, come away with a few pennies left over.Short term, we've a huge backlog of projects, anyone that wants to dive in and help write tutorials would be a friend for life!",Nick McCloud,"£3,081",Unstated,"A low-cost, simple, programmable, expandable, open source robot kit that is also a maker platform with add-ons for physical computing",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,77 , Great project.~,0.0,"£3,000",ChickBot - the fully functional low-cost robot by Nick McCloud — Kickstarter

This is how Tyche was born as an AI companion for children.The Guardian recognized the value of Tyche on January 9, 2014 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: “This little robot is apparently the most intelligent smartphone robot in the world and is capable of recognizing humans, hear and talk back, learn and solve problems autonomously.”Tyche is designed to be a social conversational companion for children. While engaged in an open conversation with Tyche, children will need to think out how to express themselves before they talk to Tyche, a cognitive artificial intelligence. In doing so, it will help them develop their cognitive and social skills in parallel with Tyche's cognitive architecture. This requires a child to reason along the whole reasoning cycle from sensing the world, understanding the situational context, finding its own problems based on their life goals and beliefs and then solving the problems interactively with multiple parties, and finally remembering the learned knowledge incrementally in their own memory.It is an enormous challenge to build such a truly intelligent personal companion for the children of the future. Your support is critical to fulfilling our mission. We ask our friends and dreamers to be part of our “A Dollar for Tyche” Campaign by funding us with one dollar each.As a token of our appreciation, one person to be chosen through lottery among every 100 backers, will receive a Tyche Limited AI robot.Thank you so much for your support by clicking on it.Richard Shinn, Ph.D.

robotics team. FIRST robotics is an acronym For Inspiration and Recognition of
Science and Technology. This has been our fourth year designing, building, and
making robots come to life. We have designed four different robotics for each
year and they all have a different task that they can perform. This year the
game is called Recycle Rush. Our robot has to stack crates and garbage pails onto a narrow platform. For more information on the game visit the FIRST
website: http://www.usfirst.org/We have a diverse group of students. One third of our team are
girls! The team has opened recruiting new members ranging from middle school to
seniors in high school. NRG 4055 is not just all about robotics, programing, and building. This team
has a whole other side to it besides the technology aspect. Marketing and
public relations have a major importance to this team as well. Without them,
all of our designs and fundraising for competitions would be difficult to
develop. The finance team helps manage our expenses and organizes our spending.
Our mentors also serve an important role. They guide us with their own advice
to help us achieve our goals. The mentors put just as much time and effort as
the students and they make this team possible.By donating to our team, you will
be helping with the cost of travel expenses to New England District
Championship and to the World Championship. If we do not qualify for the World
Championship, the money that you give us will be used for parts and equipment

 Thanks so much!This year's game, FIRST Stronghold!English Version:Chilean Heart is the first robotics team from Chile to participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition, the most challenging robotics competition with over 3000 teams from around the world. Our team is composed by students from all over Chile, who, alongside college level mentors and professionals, work during the 6 week build season. This period begins on the first Saturday of the year and the members of the teams must create a complete electro-mechanical solution to the challenge given by FIRST. To accomplish this task, our students use their summer vacations to work everyday on the robot, developing ideas, creating prototypes and finally designing a definitive version of this machine.Due to the lack of a regional in Latin America, our team must travel every year to Los Angeles, CA, to one of the many regional competitions to represent our country in this battle of brains. However, our greatest problem each year is getting every student to the competition due to the high costs of travel expenses to the US.This year, we must finish our robot for the 23rd of February and assist the competition during the 9th to the 12th of March. Despite the imminent dates, we haves still not managed to gather the funds necessary to compete in Los Angeles.Chilean Heart has a long trajectory in FRC, with this being our 9th year of participation. During that period, we have received multiple awards and recognitions, with the most important being the Regional Chairman’s Award at the Los Angeles Regional. This award is the most prestigious recognition a team can receive (besides the Championship Chairman’s Award) and recognizes a team’s importance in growing its community, besides best representing the ideals and mission of FIRST. In other words, it is a team that has become a role model for other teams to look up to.The basic costs for travelling and competing at the competition consist of plane tickets and accommodation for around 20 people in Long Beach, CA, host city for the event. These amount to around 40,000 USD. That is why we have turned to you, the Kickstarter community to ask you for help in turning the young dreams our students have into a reality!We're fully funded... but not there yet!

El equipo está conformado por estudiantes de distintos colegios de a lo largo del país, quienes guiados por mentores, tanto profesionales como universitarios, trabajan en conjunto para construir en 6 semanas un robot que pueda suplir el desafío propuesto. Para poder realizar esta tarea, sacrifican sus vacaciones de verano para trabajar día a día en el desarrollo del robot, desarrollando ideas, creando prototipos y diseñando una versión final.A falta de una regional en América Latina, el equipo debe viajar cada año a Los Ángeles, California, para poder representar a Chile y dejar el nombre del país en lo más alto. El problema se genera cuando debemos embarcar tanto a cada miembro como al robot para que puedan viajar a la competencia, ya que los altos costos de pasajes hacen que esto no sea una tarea fácil, y muchas veces, deja con varios miembros sin la posibilidad de viajar.Este año, ya siendo la cuarta semana de construcción, el robot está bastante avanzado y estará listo para la fecha estipulada por la organización de la competencia, el cual es el 23 de Febrero. A pesar de esto, el equipo no cuenta con los recursos suficientes para ir a competir, dejando a cada miembro con las ganas de representar al país.Corazón de Chileno lleva participando 9 años en FIRST Robotics Competition, siendo varias veces reconocido con distintos premios. En el año 2014, el equipo obtuvo el premio Chairman’s Award, el reconocimiento más prestigioso de la competencia, el cual honra al equipo que mejor representa un modelo de emular e incorpora los objetivos y la misión de FIRST, siendo un ejemplo para los otros equipos. Los gastos que se necesitan cubrir son los básicos para poder viajar y competir, estos son tickets de avión y alojamiento para 20 personas en Long Beach, California, lugar en donde se realizará la Competencia en Marzo de este año.

159," Power tools, metal, robots, and 22 brilliant students all make up the foundation of Robotics Club. A group of students at Mission Hills High School, led by myself and four other officers, combined our knowledge in order to create a robot to compete against others at the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition (FRC) at the San Diego Regional located at the Valley View Casino Center, March 6-8.
My team, the Iron Kodiaks, faced many obstacles. At the beginning of the season, we had to raise $6,000 just to compete in FRC, which we did through fundraising and receiving grants and sponsorships. Once we collected the money, the real work began. We had a mere six weeks to build a fully-functioning robot that could carry out a specific function during the competitions with a different task each year, this year’s being Aerial Assist. The field in which the robots competed during the game consisted of a high goal and two low goals on each side of the field along with a truss located in the center; the robots were in random alliances consisting of three teams with objectives to score points by launching a two feet diameter exercise ball over a truss or by shooting it into the high or low goals. My team decided to create a defensive goalie robot that blocked the goals our opponents attempted to score, benefitting us in competitions.
On March 6, 17 students and I showed up at the Valley View Casino Center where we saw our hard work pay off and our robot, Varsam Utgangusador, compete against others in the practice rounds. There were a few mishaps in the beginning with the robot’s high goal blocker not functioning properly, but once we repaired Varsam, we were unstoppable. Many outstanding robots were unable to get passed the defense we played, and some got so frustrated that they decided to ram their robots into Varsam, covering it with dents and scratches.
The next day, beginning with opening ceremonies, was the first round of actual matches. My team started off exceptionally, winning our first 3 matches and, at one point, we ended up in 3rd place out of 60 teams from across the world, including Germany and Canada.
After the second and final day was the awards ceremony. When the Rookie All Star Award was presented, a brief description of the winning team was given. The announcer spoke of how one rookie team did an all-around great job during their first year as a team and described a team that sounded a lot like my own. Some key words that distinguished my team from the rest were spoken and excitement consumed us. The announcers called my team, Team 5137 the Iron Kodiaks, to the stage to accept our award, throwing the crowd into utter excitement.
Along with the Rookie All Star Award came an invitation to compete alongside roughly 10,000 other students in the nationally televised international competition held in St. Louis, Missouri, April 24-26. However, this is where we need help. There was a $5,000 fee just to register for the competition which drained our funds and more. We now require money for travel, lodging, and other expenses required for the drip.This an opportunity of a lifetime and I would hate to miss out because of a lack of monetary means to get there. I would really appreciate any help that you can give! Thank you so much in advance!

160,"   Amaryllo is ranked as worldwide number-one camera robot company by research institutes. Koova 2 is the proud winner of 2017 CES Innovation Award!  This is the consecutive 3rd year that Amaryllo has won this prestigious honor. Koova 2 is the world's smallest camera robot that comes with auto tracking and facial recognition. It is portable and powered by USB power source. You can use it anywhere.With embedded powerful multi-core CPUs, Koova 2  is an intelligent camera robot that has a smart “brain” to perform real-time video analytics so it can track intruders and recognize faces to safeguard your home 24 hours a day.  In fact, the toughest challenge for the engineering team during the development of Koova 2 is how to squeeze in the powerful multi-core CPUs in the small housing and take care of heat dissipation issues. Amaryllo team was faced with a dilemma: using powerful multi-core CPUs generates a lot of heat, but the housing need to be kept small, so there isn't a lot of room for the heat to dissipate.  After many trial and errors, Amaryllo engineering team finally came up with a solution: fabricate the back cover using aluminium metal to act as a heat sinker and re-arrange our PCB layers for the CPUs to directly contact the aluminium to quickly dissipate heat. This ingenious solution enables us to pack many powerful functions in Koova 2 such as facial recognition and auto-tracking, yet still keep it in a very small form factor.   Amaryllo Facial Recognition technology can fast recognize family members. It takes only 1 second to recognize family members and can identify multiple people at the same time.  Koova 2 deploys a highly sophisticated and accurate Facial Recognition solution that detects and recognizes people’s faces that appear in the camera’s field of view with high degree of recognition rate.  This intelligent Facial Recognition solution has learning capability that will continuously improve on the accuracy of future recognition. This brief video shows how to set up Amaryllo facial recognition in simple steps. You can set up as many as 4 persons in one device.This below video shows 1 easy step on how to add more pictures to enhance recognition over time. You can add as many as 50 pictures of yours to greatly improve recognition rate. Try to add your faces from different angles, distances, etc. Make sure to show both of your eyes clearly to be recognized. ""Continuous Learning"" lets Koova 2 remember your face in different angles, lighting and moods allowing it to know you better and better over time! Koova 2 offers smart alerts allowing you to quickly dial pre-registered phone numbers to reach your loved ones or police. You can remotely activate the device alarm to scare off intruders as well. Above is a live demo of Koova 2 auto-tracking visitors at 2016 Essen Security Exhibition. Note that Koova was powered by a power bank.Typical 64-bit cameras can be hacked in 10 minutes. Amaryllo is the first smart home company to offer world’s highest 256-bit encryption to best protect your privacy.  The possible combination of 256-bit encryption is more than the number of the stars in the universe so is virtually not hack-able.  This is the same encryption technology as deployed by NASA and Pentagon.
  The Activity Zones will allow you to define what area you wish to protect. Using the Amaryllo App, you will be able to design up to 4 boxes to watch over your most valuable possessions. With just a touch of your fingers, you can customize the zones to look after what matters to you the most and ignore the other zones.  The Blockout Zones work the opposite way of the activity zones. You can draw a box on your screen to cover an area you don't want to be notified for.
 Amaryllo’s dynamic P2P server will monitor the available bandwidth to enable the best quality two-way talk, so you can communicate through Koova 2 anytime, anywhere.
Koova 2 can greet you throughout the day with a ""Hello"" or ""Good afternoon"" and announce hourly time. Human speech is proven useful to warn off intruders. Multiple speech languages are being added by our backers to make Amaryllo products more useful. Koova2 has a front-facing warning LED light to scare off intruders! When any of its sensors are triggered, Koova 2 will instantly send you an alert on your smart devices. Koova2 is highly portable and can even operate from the portable battery power supply, so you can setup Koova 2 cordlessly in any location.  This makes Koova 2 an ideal travel companion and it can help safeguard your valuable possessions even when you are on the trip. It is recommended to power Koova by standard 5V / 2A power banks.       Amaryllo Services is a secure online storage platform provided by Amaryllo that is accessible from anywhere in the world. You can always look back your recorded video from any device that is linked to an Amaryllo Services connected product.  The Video Alert Feature enables all cloud subscription members to receive instant video push messages, after the audio and motion sensors of the camera are triggered. We rewind the recorded video by 3 seconds so you can see what actually happened. A 10-second video alert will be sent to all registered family members anywhere, anytime.

You do not seem to respond to any after sales questions (about connection, etc) brought up by your backers in Atom.  Your last response was 18 October and some 30+ questions thereafter have been left unattended to.  Perhaps you would like to explain your failure to respond to your backers in Atom as this does not give me any confidence about backing your current campaign. After all, after sales support is essential.~This is bizar. Backers from the ATOM project are waiting weeks for answers and the creator just ignore them after getting  the Kicksterter money. All promises that are made during campaign just ain't true. Customer service seems none existing. Warning too all, when campaign ends, creator moves on too the next and forgets about you, and what promises are made. Me and many others have some pretty useless partly finished machine, because creator just doen not keep his promise :( ...~With IR vision (even though no IR LEDs are built in) that would be the absolutely perfect travel companion. I have been carrying an iCam Pro around and a Koova2 would be a much better choice for such.~I guess I wasn't clear enough in my message below about IR capture. I do not expect Koova2 to have any IR LED, but just to be able to capture IR content in the dark (relying on external IR light for such). You see, if the camera can capture even though it does not have a IR light, we can still capture, as long as we use some external IR source in the environment. If you seek for WiCam that is the approach they took. Their camera can capture IR content, but it relies on external IR light for that. So, if one does wish to capture video also in the dark, it would suffice to install some external IR source. WiCam offered one light source that turns on/off depending on whether or not there is enough visible light in the environment (that IR light source cost less than $20 a piece). That is the very IR light source I am using at home to light up a long corridor so that iCam Pro can fetch it properly lit even though it is at the edge of the video (the built in LEDs weren't enough for the long corridor). So, if you can make Koova2 capture IR content WITHOUT HAVING ANY IR LED BUILT IN, it would be super, and perhaps that wouldn't complicate too much the design.~Hi on a full charge if you had this out somewhere doing a video of action shots or something &  without any backup power how long would it last on a single unstopped record mode with its available onboard memory.~Just to make sure. The device is 'blind' at night?~Your last update states the camera will start shipping in January but your pledge levels state shipping will start December. Which is it? And if they are shipping December, can we expect to receive it by Christmas? ~How does the flash function work when dark? Do you get clear videos or just a bright spot?~Thank you for the clarification. As far as I understand, we will get the improved version, right?~Hello!~How many hours of onboard memory does it have? When that is exhausted, does it stop recording or continue by overwriting old data? I I'm interested in traveling with it to places without wifi or bad wifi. Thanks. Very excited about your product. :-)~hi guys. this looks really cool and clever, full of possibilities! my first question; can we have Koova back up videos on local storage as well? can we tell it to start and stop recording manually, even without a digital UI, i.e. is there a record button on the device or a programmable sensor trigger possible? what smart home platforms can it communicate with?thanks for your time and this great campaign, looking forward to seeing it develop. congratulations on the fantastic start so far!~(And that would make koova the perfect traveling companion)~Could you have add on pledges for someone who would like to get some extra Atom units?~",0.0,"$1,000","World's Smallest Portable Camera Robot, 2017 CES Winner by Amaryllo International — Kickstarter"

164," Team 6040: Getobotics is a FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics team comprised of 10 determined secondary school students between the ages of 15-18 and 6 dedicated mentors, who are all recent university graduates. Every year, FIRST Robotics hosts a series of regional and national design competitions that provide high school students with hands on experience in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. This season, we will be competing against 150 other teams in the Montreal Reigional Competition on March 30, 2016 at Stade Uniprix.This venture requires teams to embark upon an intense six-week project through which industry professionals and university students join forces with local high school students to design, construct, and control a remotely operated vehicle for a sports-based playoff. Each team begins with a basic kit and must use its creativity to design and build a vehicle that meets competition guidelines and outperforms its components at a given task. Since participating in our first competition, Beta Bots Pre-First Robotics on January 9, 2016, we have grown from a group of 4 students and 2 mentors to 10 students and 6 mentors. Despite being a newly established group who competed for the first time, we won the top prize for most creative design and overall third place. Throughout the building phase, our students learn the value of teamwork, recognize the importance of creating industry allies, polish their interpersonal skills and professionalism and are rewarded with a sense of pride in applying various engineering concepts. Currently, we are in the process of building a robot that will hopefully dominate the national competition and qualify us to compete at the National Championships in St. Louis, Missouri on April 22, 2016. As of now, the team meets every Thursday and Friday from 6-9pm, and on Saturdays from 12-5pm. During these times, we work tirelessly to complete the robot by our February 23, 2016 deadline. Up to this point we have received a total of $10,000 in sponsorship from First Robotics, the Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design and Information (CIADI), and the Concordia Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department (MIE). However, our total expenses far exceed this amount. Thus far, our mentors have contributed over $2000 in order to keep the program running. We are passionate about what our students are doing and want to see the program grow, but we need your help to keep it alive! Consequently, we are seeking our community's support and greatly appreciate any assistance that can be provided. Your involvement will not only directly benefit our students, but it will also demonstrate your support to the community’s youth.

165,"   With 3 years of research and development, Amaryllo introduces ATOM AR3 in collaboration with some large operators to create the first intelligent outdoor face-detection and auto-tracking security robots to protect your family and properties. AR3 is the first outdoor security robot that meets stringent IP55 water-dust resistance grade so you can install it in your home front or back yard porch to monitor your properties. You can install it in your office buildings to monitor your properties 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. AR3 revolutionizes today's home and office security systems. Traditional auto-tracking systems require network cameras with remote computers. The tracking systems are bulky and expensive. Amaryllo's patented design drastically reduces the cost by embedding multi-core CPUs inside cameras to turn typical cameras as robotic cameras with built-in intelligence to see human faces and auto-track people in real time.  Amaryllo invented robotic cameras by embedding high-power computers inside cameras such that each camera has artificial intelligence to detect human faces (not animals') to talk to people and to auto-track people 360 degrees. Standalone auto-tracking without computers and smart 360-degree tracking networks are Amaryllo's patented/patent-pending technologies worldwide.Shown below is ATOM AR3's 3D design:
AR3
    by Amaryllo
    on Sketchfab
  ATOM AR3 comes in with two versions: One has a light bulb adapter (AR3) and the other has a standard power plug and Ethernet port (AR3S). Both devices have built-in advanced 2 x 2 802.11 bgn WiFi modules.                                   The set-up process of AR3 takes less than a minute. Once powered, all you have to do is to enter your router SSID and password, and our app will complete the rest for you. There is no need to set up accounts or others.

AR3 detects motion, audio as well as human faces and sends out push-notifications to every registered mobile device in real time. It asks strangers to identify themselves before triggering the intruder alarm. AR3's lens tracks motion 360° in a radius of over 10 meters (30 feet) leaving no blind spots. With built-in infrared lights, AR3 even sees everything in complete darkness. The advanced mechanics design allows AR3 to pan and tilt simultaneously for fast tracking.      Amaryllo is the number-one award winner at 2015 CES Innovation Award under Embedded Technologies and repeats itself at 2016. Company has won 3 consecutive Computex Best Choice Award since 2014 and is the 2016 top winner under Security category.           ",Amaryllo International,"$40,308",Unstated,"AR3 is the first outdoor robotic camera.

Also dont seem to have issues with tracking delay. My issue is still the same...the device tracking every insect that flys by and if one lands...it sits and watches it and not what it should be watching. (i dont need a 30 min view of the ceiling while a bug chills.)~Taiwan? Fedex tell me they were shipped from Shenzhen to Hong Kong, then to Australia.Never mind, we will do vulnerability checks on the cameras.~@ticanaus - i agree on the smart device link.  The schedule function is good.  But it doesnt help much if you cant trust the alerts.  Ex: I either need it on..and warned every time a bug flies by...or off and dont know when someone is breaking into my door.   There has to be adjustments made for this to be usable.  Hopefully its in a software update.  Seems both the motion sensitivity and the volume can be more adjustable.  Its great the camera is that detailed but there has to be a way for it to tell its a bug and not real movement.  Add distance detecting, which would allow the system to determine aprox size of an object. (Software add on...could ask you to measure points for the camera to make a depth comparison chart..)  As far as volume, there just needs to be a lower then low option.  A slider would make it more customizable for users.~@Chris Gomez Hi Chris, I notice the same with mine, it has overly sensitive audio trigger even when I turn it to low. The GUI for Audio is strange, it has high on the left and low on the right whereas other has low on the left and high on the right. I like schedule function to have other function beside privacy ie low audio trigger during day time and maybe medium/high during night time, greeting to be only turn on at a specific hour. It be great if the camera can link to other smart devices in the home, ie when there is an event turn on specific lifx light or blink specific lifx light.~Thanks Chris Gomez for the good review!~Received mine in Australia.No tracking number and had to pay additional $206!!!!~So comments from those of us who have received it? -mine are as follows - The good1) Device does seem built well - doesnt feel cheap.2) Movement is good. Volume is high. Detection is strong.~I have now received a tracking number for shipping via Quantium.~Mine arrived saturday. No tracking.~I ordered the ar3s and haven't heard a thing. ETA please and a tracking number.~Backer 6 from the Midwest in the states got my unit yesterday. Sucks no option to add more memory to the unit like older units had but seems nice~everyone who received should post what backer number they were to give the rest of us an idea of which numbers went out.~Still waiting for ""the much anticipated tracking number before April 7th"" to come through. Ha ha ha~I just received mine in Belgium. Setback was the additional charge of 140 euros to be paid.  I was expecting about half, because VAT was still to be added as mentioned. However the other half were customs charges. This seemed odd since the package was sent from Germany to neighbouring country Belgium and there is free traffic of goods and people in the euro-zone. Anyone knows why there's a customs charge?~We'll see how long it will take to make it all the way to Australia!!!!~My camera arrived Hong Kong yesterday!~The camera arrived Germany yesterday. No trackingnumber and no information that its on the way.~Lars: Yea i considered the Jiffy, the Hudaway, and the Chris.  And a few of the smart watches you have pledged on.  Lightpack was probably the 1 thing i got that i can say was what they promised with no real issues and that ive still not seen a cheaper better product for what it did.~Troy Havard: You should not expect much communication before you receive your reward. A tracking number does help much if you don't know where to look for the tracking information.~Chris Gomez: My information is probably not very useful for you as you pledged for a different model and your reward probably will be shipped from somewhere else. But at least I can tell you that they actually have started shipping.That is hard to say, the things are very different and many things still haven't arrived either because the projects are delayed or they turned out to be scams. But it seems like this project seems to be one of the better ones.~I am backer #29 but have received NO communication, nor shipping/tracking number - in the US.~Thanks for the info Lars.  Since I ordered the other model i still have no real ETA. Plus im in the US and number 107.  So fingers crossed for me.  You have backed quite a few things....what would you say was the best?~All: I received an answer to my question below via email, they sent me the tracking number, but no link to how to track the shipment. I asked when they shipped the camera and when I could expect to receive it, that they did not answer.I did however receive the camera today, it was shipped on the 17th of march from Germany. As mentioned earlier I am backer number 7.~internal reviews to correct and to improve our customer service - ~Amaryllo: I pledged for an AR3S, but I have neither received the camera or any shipping information, do you have an explanation for that?~Ticanaus: Thanks. Could you tell us how you received your camera, the shipping method/company? And if possible tell us when your reward was shipped or how long it took for it to reach you? As mentioned before I am backer number 7 and haven't received anything.~Hi all, I am backer 27. Cheers~@ Ticanaus  - Right please check your backing number...It would go a long way in helping us fig out whats going on.~Why on earth wouldn't they come and comment that stuff has shipped.  Amaryllo communication is getting worse with every new product release.~I can see that Ticanaus is located in Australia, which is closer to Taiwan than Europe or Northamerica. That could explain the faster delivery. Like William Dutcher I would also like to know what backernumber Ticanaus has?~Chris Gomez: I understand your point, but according to Kickstarter rules a campaign is meant to get funding for at project not to add some extra funding for at project that is already on its way. This is not an advertising platform for commercial products or like Kickstarter always likes to write, this is not an online store.~@Ticanous, That's great news! So they are shipping. Just taking a little time to get delivered. Can you tell us your backer number?~Hi all, just wanted to let everyone know that I didn't get a tracking notice but received my camera today. Cheers~Yes but the more backing, the lower that cost can be. Especially in intro production.  Once everything is worked out its easier to drop production cost.  But when things are in the early stages there is alot of kinks to running small orders.  A company making a 1000 unit order is more then all the backers on here combined.  Looking at their sale point, it appears that they didnt pay much less then we did (unless they did a 100% markup).  So without you knowing, that size order could of reduced the cost when they put it on here.  That deal was likely in place before this campaign started.  Like pointed out earlier, that may of also lead to other improvements that would not have been avail.   ~Chris Gomez: If you want to get money from backers you have to offer your creation at a lower price, both because of the the uncertainty of success and because of the long time you have to wait for the thing you pay for long time in advance. I can't see that I get the product for any less than what I backed with I however have to pay import duties because the product is not shipped from within the EU.~@Lars not defending their behavior...as communication has been been bad and when the shipments did not happen they should of informed us of what to expect.~William Dutcher: Why not wait untill you start shipping with informing backers about it? How do we benefit from lower product cost, do you get any money back just because you wait 6+ month longer? Why not keep things realistic and honest? I think it is fair that they get funding from other people/companies, but why couldn't they inform us about that from the start and why tell people that they start shipping when a month after we are still waiting?~Amaryllo International: A month has passed since the last update and that you wrote that you would start shipping very soon. What about responding to the people that expected to get something very soon?~I expected it from the beginning. There's no way that $40k could fund this project to completion. They had to partner up with others to make it happen and that involves agreements. But we benefited to, lower product cost, smaller size, facial recognition, and other possible improvements that partner companies required. We may not be the first to receive the camera. But it should not take long to ship to just 99 backers. Getting though Customs may present some challenges.~What a joke instead of shipping to us the backers they shipped to stores and stocked their website. This is the worst run kickstarter that I have felt with lately~Phil: At least you got an update. I am backer number 7, I let you know when I receive anything.~Maybe the first shipment went to the retail .com ""Onefantasticshop"". They are showing 500 AR3 and 495 AR3S currently in stock and are taking orders. I assume they sold 5 of the AR3S but not sure they are shipping yet. As long as we get our units soon I am happy to see them marking these. It means better support and firmware updates.~Phil, You would have had to be Backer #1 to be part of the ""First"" Shipment. HA HA HA :-)~Gotta love it ask for an update and get told I was not part of the first shipment. Funny part is I'm backer number 6 so what are they doing shipping one at a time?~Bad Situation, maybe i should visit Them And asked directly for news!~Second week of March~Amaryllo, After backing three of your Campaigns I would have thought your communication would have gotten better.  Going forward you really need to let your backers know what is going on more often.  We are now in the second week of February with no update on shipments.  Look at kickstarter items like the Portal router where they responded EVERY DAY to questions in the comments and gave updates once a week even if there wasnt much new info.~Not sure how it will handle multiple subjects in different directions. Maybe by locking into the strongest heat source? Maybe the creators could comment on that also. From what I'm seeing here with early backers I do not think shipping has begun yet. Hopefully we will hear something soon.~",0.0,"$1,000","ATOM AR3, The Future Intelligent Outdoor Security Robot by Amaryllo International — Kickstarter"
166," FIRST® FRC Team 314 Megatron Oracles is based out of Flint, MI.  Each year our team has six weeks to design, build and program a robot to compete in the FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC).  From January to Mid-February, our team of students work with mentors in various technical and non-technical fields to accomplish this goal.  Afterwards, we compete at district events in hopes of qualifying for the Michigan FRC® State Championship which is held in April.  Our team consists of approximately 20+ students from grades 9-12. This small group of students come from various socioeconomic backgrounds, broad academic abilities as well as students with special needs. The students with special needs range in various levels on the ASD spectrum.  This team offers them a safe place to land and will always have their backs both in and out of school. For the first time, our ASD students are experiencing being part of a team and their incredible academic abilities allow them to shine among their peers.  Their communication skills increase each year and their very active roles on the team offer them great success and a chance to celebrate during both our build season as well as during competitions.  The FIRST® program aims to promote careers in the STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) fields. This is also known as a part of STEM. This team plans on doing just that as they pursue areas in these fields post graduation. In the last few years, our team has been growing in numbers but our work space continues to shrink. Our 80'x80' room we once occupied is now a 27'x27' work area.  Despite this, our team continues to win and excel. Recently, our district petitioned area voters for a mill increase in hopes of creating a STEM lab for our district. Our team worked hard to promote the millage knowing what it could mean for robotics in our district.  But despite great efforts from our district, the community didn't see the need for it and voted it down.  As our district continues to look for other options for our STEM lab, our team remains optimistic that one day CA will have the same opportunities as other teams that we compete against.  Being located in an economically depressed city has strongly impacted our team. Many of our competitors have the opportunity to spend their build season within the walls of their mentors, such as inside the Chrysler building, tooling manufacturers or inside the GM Proving Grounds. During the 2013 build season, our team remained in our tight confines yet we made it to the World Championships. We hope to return in 2014 and show everyone what Big MO is all about...hard work and optimism! Your contribution would help in purchasing new equipment, supplies for the robot, bus transportation to competitions, and provide team t-shirts for our students to show their pride and team spirit. Your assistance would give a sense of hope, confidence and faith by showing them there is a positive future for them.  In return, I can promise you that they will work hard, play even harder but above all be committed to EXCELLENCE in all they do. What is FIRST®? FIRST® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is not just about creating a robot. It is a worldwide robotics organization started by Dean Kamen, Founder of FIRST®  and inventor of, among many other technological advances, the Segway, wanted to get kids as excited about math and science as they are about sports.  Sometimes called the “Varsity Sport of the Mind, “ FIRST® reaches students of all ages, from elementary to high school.  This is a sport where “everyone can go PRO!” So what do FIRST®  students really learn? 	Shop skills, such drilling with hand drills and drill press, using band, table & chop saws and handling metal and wood 	Mechanical Engineering skills, such as fabricating parts and working with motors, gears, servos and pneumatics. 	Electrical Engineering skills, such as experience with wiring, working with circuit boards and soldering 	Programming skills, such as learning and programming C++, Labview, Visual Basics and Java  2D & 3D solid modeling skills , such as using Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD 2D & 3D, Solidworks and practicing top-down modeling used to create an intelligent CAD representation of the robot 	Public Relations skills such as public speaking, marketing, branding, and team promotion 	Web design skills, such  coding and graphic design 	Animating skills such as using 3DS Max Design 	Problem-solving, designing and prototyping skills 	Teamwork, communications and collaboration skills In other words, FIRST® Robotics students are getting hands on experience that will give them a “kickstart” for college and beyond!

The Zombiebot Nano is a snap-together, colour-coded robot that kids can build and programme using simple, drag-and-drop software. When assembled, it's designed to be an obstacle-avoiding robot in order to teach kids about sensors and control, but is capable of much more than this. We teach kids how to programme the robot step-by-step using an eBook and video tutorials, but we also provide all of the finished code as well so you can get going right out of the box if you want to.Our upgrade version (The Nano+) contains all the electronics to become not only obstacle-avoiding robot, but also line-following robot, and an Android smartphone-controlled robot. There's no soldering required: all of the parts are colour-coded and snap together so kids can build the whole thing from the ground up. Seriously- it's so easy even adults can do it! In New Zealand most kids don't get access to electronics, robotics and coding in schools- here's your chance to do something about that, and help build a high-tech future for our country while you're at it. The Zombiebot mission is to make robotics and programming so much fun that we turn innovation into contagion.  ",ZombiebotHQ.com,"NZ$ 3,331",Unstated,"The Zombiebot Nano is a low-cost programmable robot that anyone can build.

170," SimplyTronics commits to improving technology education conditions in schools by developing technology while keeping costs down. For this reason we decided to design and manufacture our own ST EDU (SimplyTronics Educational) board. This board will be compatible with existing Arduino and robotics kit tutorials. We will be able to release the board by itself or with the parts forming a complete robot kit.We have several years of experience designing and manufacturing Arduino-compatible hardware and sensors. Below you can see an early prototype (green board on the left) for the BOE Shield (right) we designed in collaboration with Parallax, under the request of RobotC developers. The BOE Shield has been in the market for a couple of years and is a very successful product.The ST EDU board integrates in a single board the Open Source Arduino UNO,  the BOE Shield we designed for Parallax, plus some extra features, like the on-board power management to recharge Li-Ion batteries. Below you can see a picture of the Arduino + BOE Shield combo (left) and a prototype of the ST EDU integrating everything in a single board (right). The ST EDU board shown in this picture is a prototype and you can see some extra parts soldered on the board or jumper wires correcting some connections.After the BOE Shield design was finished, we had plenty of ideas for designing a board that simplified things for teachers deploying the hardware in their classrooms. We came up with the idea of making a single board that took care of the prototyping area, the microcontroller itself and the rechargeable batteries with full, on-board power management (the batteries don't need to be removed from the board to be recharged).  The cost of such setup would be about $140 if buying individual boards and connecting them together but we could make a board that could be sold for $45 if we integrated the three systems into one single board.The ST EDU board could be used by itself as an Arduino compatible platform with a prototyping area. Arduino-compatible shields can be stacked on top of it, just as if it was an Arduino UNO compatible microcontroller. This ST EDU board can also be used on top of a robotics platform. Below you can see our latest design (after taking care of modifications found in the prototypes - no more jumper wires or extra parts needed).And the board used on top of a Boe-Bot or Shield-Bot robot chassis:ST EDU is compatible with any documentation that supports the BOE Shield from Parallax, so you can use ST EDU to follow educational material posted on learn.parallax.com. Our robotics kit will be compatible with all the posted online curriculum (equivalent to ~360 pages if printed as a book). This material was already developed and exists today. You can follow the link to check it online.Or if you prefer the RobotC environment you can use ST EDU with curriculum developed for the Shield-BOE by RobotC. ST EDU boards and robotics kits are fully compatible with any BOE Shield project you can find in their website:If you already own a robotics kit (like Boe-Bot or Shield-Bot) you could just buy the ST EDU and place it on top of the robot. We also offer the board with all the parts to assemble the robot and perform the activities available online. The picture below shows the parts you will receive in the full kit including a USB cable (not shown in the picture).The board design is finished and we are ready to move into production. We are already generating documentation online. Below you can find the link to the product documentation and a sample of how we show board dimensions in the documentation:ST EDU documentation page, which you can find in this link:http://simplytronics.com/products/ST-00101We have taught multiple Educator's Courses over the years, using different platforms. In the pictures below, you can see a class we taught in December 15, 2014, where 20 teachers from the Inland Northwest got try the robotics kits based on the ST EDU.Lakeside High School, located in Nine Mile Falls, WA, organizes a robotics competition that is free for participants to attend. They also provide some free kits to schools attending this robotics competition and free training for local teachers. March 14, 2015 will be the first time that schools will be participating in this robotics competition using the ST EDU based robots.To ensure the success of this competition, SimplyTronics will be donating 50 full robotics kits to Lakeside High School. The robots will be loaned for free to schools that would like to participate in this free robotics competition.The board design is completed, manufacturing and logistics are in place and schools are ready to use this material, so why do a Kickstarter campaign now?SimplyTronics usually operates in the background, providing contract manufacturing and logistics services to other companies, lacking direct interaction with customers. That's why we need help in this project.

PicassoBot is the perfect combination of ""wow"" and learning. It allows kids to solve problems using concepts that they learned in school, but were never allowed to actually use in real situations. PicassoBot was designed and created to help Junior and Senior High School students 
learn STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) 
concepts in a tangible way. PicassoBot is a kit that contains everything (including the screwdriver) needed to create a robot arm that will draw pictures with a pen or pencil. Building the robot takes one to two hours, allowing kids to get to that ""cool"" moment quickly in a classroom setting or at home without losing interest.  No soldering required!The PicassoBot Simulator (desktop application) is used for drawing pictures on the computer (Mac, Windows, Linux) and sending them to the robot. Kids can sketch pictures on the screen and the software translates those mouse strokes into lines and curves which are then converted to angles for the PicassoBot shoulder and elbow servo angles and sent over the USB cable to the robot drawing the creation on the paper. It even includes the capability to use the webcam to take live pictures and draw sketches of them! No batteries are needed as it is powered by the USB cable. We will post a link to download the PicassoBot Simulator as an update half way 
through the campaign so you can have a chance to play with PicassoBot 
before you actually get to touch it.With the optional capacitive touchpad placed under the drawing paper (it is thin as paper), kids can program the robot to play tic-tac-toe with them or expand their horizons by coming up with their own interactive creations. The touchpad attaches to the PicassoBot with four wires and can detect the nine separate tic-tac-toe grid sections when someone touches a finger on top of the drawing paper. The bottom of the touchpad is clear plastic so that kids can see everything inside, inspiring them to modify it and build their own. A modified version of the touchpad can even be used to roughly detect how far your hand is above the drawing surface.With the optional bluetooth upgrade, an Android phone can also be 
used to take pictures, vectorize them and have the robot quickly draw 
the sketch. The optional WiFi upgrade allows connection from any web 
browser. The PicassoBot Kit is cut and assembled in the US by local students.The PicassoBot is great for parties to draw portrait sketches and really is a good ice breaker for geeky dads. Even though drawing pictures with the robot is really cool and will keep kids (and adults) interested for hours on end, the real purpose of PicassoBot is to open the creative minds of kids and let them innovate and explore. All of the project is open source including the hardware, microcontroller firmware, and the computer software. We tried to make the hardware simple and understandable by including as few parts as possible and using existing open tools that are targeted to a learning environment. With PicassoBot, kids can create their own IoT (Internet of Things) projects within hours.The included TI LaunchPad is a perfect platform for young engineers to learn ""physical computing"". With the Energia IDE (fully compatible with Arduino code) the students can program the robot easily with only a few lines of code. All software on the computer was written in Processing, a good introduction to programming that leads directly into C and Java later. Internally the images are stored as simple SVG graphics paths that can be easily integrated into numerous applications that the kids can tie in with. Conversion math (turning XY coordinates into shoulder and wrist angles) is kept at a minimum needed so that kids will not get lost in translation, literally.Just as an example, one teacher used the kits in his classroom to teach basic programming principles. After the formal training was done he challenged them to “build something useful” with the kit.  One student then wrote code to get the current temperature once a minute from a weather site and used the PicassoBot to graph it on paper throughout the day. Another cut out a paper hand and attached it to the wrist of the PicassoBot and mounted it on the front of the fridge. He programmed it so that whenever he sent it an email from school, it would wave to everyone in the kitchen. Another way to reach out and touch someone!The Educated Robot team is led by Wayne Rust, an entrepreneurial engineer with over 25 years of experience in the world of servers, smart phones, optical media, and robotics. An award winning mentor for FLL, TSA, Boy Scouts, iGeneration and more, he firmly believes in the open source community and that kids learn best by actually using hands-on challenges to enforce concepts taught in the classroom.Wayne is joined in this venture by his four teenage daughters who provide inspiration, technical support, soldering, testing, artwork (including composing the music and layout for the video above), and lots of frank feedback. They are hoping to have enough kits to build during the summer so that they can go to Disneyland to see more robots - that is a LOT of kits, so PLEASE support them!PicassoBot began life over three years ago as I was trying to find an inexpensive way to introduce kids to robotics principles including multiple DOF (degrees of freedom) arms, communications with the outside world, compact design for the classroom, and a practical use for the robot. After many, many iterations the current configuration was found to be the best compromise that met all of my criteria. It was introduced into the curriculum of a couple of high school robotics classes with great success and a lot of feedback that was incorporated into current revision.The PicassoBot has also been presented at the Utah Association of Career and Technical Education Conference, Las Vegas Mini-MakerFaire, and OpenWest Open Source Conference to great applause. Meet up with Natalie and Wayne at the San Fransisco MakerFaire May 17-18, 2014. After seeing the great response that many other robots kits received on Kickstarter, we decided it was time to release it to the world in order to get the funds to make it inexpensive and available.You can help us provide this unique kit to kids and help us get enough funding to move on to the next level. Even with Wayne’s undying passion for robots, money is still needed to pay for robot parts and support more cool projects in the future.Pledge now to support us with ANY amount that you would like. The rewards on the right side are set to cover the cost of materials, shipping and minimum wage labor to put them together.  The more people we have pledge, the lower the costs will eventually become.  You can also pledge more than the reward amounts listed, those are just minimum amounts to cover costs. Need two or three kits? Just double or triple the pledge and we will take care of you. We can even drop ship a kit as a gift with a note written by PicassoBot on your behalf (you have to come up with wording though, PicassoBot is not fluent in English). Don’t worry about us getting too many pledges, the girls have lots of friends that are waiting on the sidelines to help us fulfill any large orders :)Even if you don’t have anyone in mind that might desire one of these, PLEASE pledge and we will donate a kit to a school for you.We need your help in getting the word out to EVERYONE you know via email, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and more! Click on the buttons below to get things started:Although no reward is enough to tell you thanks for pledging and helping us get the PicassoBot out to kids who will benefit, we would like to give some reward for even the smallest pledge. All rewards will ship by the end of August 2014 at the latest. We feel very confident that this is a realistic goal with plenty of margin for any unforeseen problems that may (will) crop up. All parts have been sourced and are waiting for final numbers before orders are confirmed.For a minimum pledge of $20 you can get your portrait drawn and signed by PicassoBot.  As soon as we meet the minimum funding level we will get with you and ask for a photo of you (or your pet) so we can get those out early.For $75 you will get the PicassoBot kit with all of the parts needed to get going on your own portrait sketching robot. Be sure you name your robot after it arrives as each one will have a unique personality that will be an extension of your own. Feel free to tweet #picassobot with the name you have chosen as soon as you pledge.For $90, $100, and $125 you can upgrade your PicassoBot to have metal gear servos for a smoother drawing, a touchpad to play tic-tac-toe against the robot (he is pretty smart, but I am sure you can program him to be dumb – or only let you win and not your friends), and Bluetooth or WiFi capabilities to allow you to connect with Android phones and browsers. We highly recommend getting the metal gear servo and touchpad upgrades.Don’t forget that you don’t have to get one just for yourself. You can get one, two, three or more and send them to those needy or nerdy kids down the street, that brilliant nephew or niece, your administrative assistant who needs an extra hand, or if you can’t think of anyone else we will select a school that can use them and take advantage of your generosity. Just double or triple your pledge and we will get the details from you at the end of the campaign. Email us directly at picassobot@educatedrobot.com with your desires if you can’t wait until then.Too lazy to spend a couple of hours reading instructions, building it, and calibrating the servos? Just add $10 to your pledge and let us know when you get the survey that you would like to have your PicassoBot ready to go out of the box in less than a minute and The Educated Robot team will gladly take care of building it for you.Again, thank you for the time to check out PicassoBot.

I would kick in to any fund to get this guy in front of a judge with all his phantom medical ailments and juvenile excuses.~I have not gotten anything, also reporting to kickstarter.~I suggest that all backers contact Wayne and request an update - also reporting the project to Kickstarter for their followup is a good idea.  If you have Linkedin Premium, you can send him e-mail and he is on Facebook as well.  His Google+ profile is herehttps://plus.google.com/103908804764080668442/about…~Wayne Please post an update with an explanation of the most recent delay and more importantly a statement as to when my package will be sent.  I hope and expect to see this by Monday,  Nov 3rd at 6:00 PM eastern time.  TIA.~TOTAL FAIL !!!!~Did anyone receive their PicassoBot yet?I did not and also did not yet get a tracking number.Wayne's last comment is 10 days ago and also the Educated Robot web site is down.This does not look good!!~I haven't received a tracking number either. I also notice that the web site is no longer working. I think I am owed an explanation as to what is going on.~This is my second message for my investment in your product. I still haven't received my tracking number??~I think we would be a lot more patient (I know I would), if we had access to the software to play around with.  Will it be up on your site soon?  I still only see a link to the Kickstarter.~I received a tracking number a week ago on Monday, and an email from Wayne that it should be delivered Thursday.  We have emailed back and forth a couple more times, but still no delivery.  And when I look up my tracking number on USPS, it still says that a tracking number was generated, but they have not yet picked up the package.   In a previous email he said to look out for a new Kickstarter next month.  If he doesn't do right soon on this one he will have a difficult time doing another.  Honest communication is the best way to run a Kickstarter.~Why have I not yet received my kit?? Where is my tracking number?? What is going on??Where is the software??~I have not received a tracking number. The issue here is lack of communication. I think most folks sponsoring KIckstarter projects accept delays if the developer is upfront about things. On the other hand, lack of communication and false promises don't go down very well!~Has a single person not named wayne gotten a tracking number?~Wayne~Please let us know how the kits where sent to addresses outside the USA, do you have a tracking number ?~A follow up to my question about the software. The campaign text stated ""We will post a link to download the PicassoBot Simulator as an update half way through the campaign so you can have a chance to play with PicassoBot before you actually get to touch it."" It would be really good to get the software. Is the software being shipped with the kits. The kit is not very useful without the software.~I was wondering about the status of the software. There is nothing at all on the Educated Robot web site.~Probably need to report him to KS staff.  He is also on Linked In if you want to bomb his professional profile for being so unprofessional.~No updates in 3 months.  Wayne has my money, and I have nothing.  This smells like a scam...  Has anyone received anything?~hi-  would be great to get an update.~@Larry  -  I've been waiting for a link to software since May when it was promised to me for a pre-release bot I bought for my daughters. They have pretty much given up on this project at this point.  So sad too...they had all kinds of ideas of what too draw, now they could care less and just shrug their shoulders and say ""Yeah Right"" whenever I give them an update.~Any updates on the software?  Am I completely missing it?  I've seen updates on this site to posting updated items and software to the web site, but when I go to the website, I can only see the link to the KickStarter page.   Is the web site working, or is it a problem with both my Win 8.1 Chrome and IE 11 browsers?  Thanks!~I e-mailed him yesterday but no reply so far. It would be good to get an update.~",0.0,"$10,000",PicassoBot - The Portrait Sketching Robot Kit by The Educated Robot — Kickstarter
173," Update #2: Using Makeblock to DIY a 3D (Chocolate) printerWhat is Makeblock? Makeblock is an aluminum extrusion based construct platform that can be used to bring your creations to life. With Makeblock you can make professional and steady robots, machines or even art-ware. The only limit is what you can think of. With Makeblock platform, the only necessary tool is a screw driver. There is no soldering or special skill needed. No electronic background, not familiar with programming, no problem. Everyone over fourteen years old can use Makeblock to turn their ideas into reality.We are committed to providing a complete solution to bring your ideas into the physical world to enjoy.  Why did we start this project? We wanted to create a platform that is open and accessible to everyone, to allow people with varying skills and backgrounds to create something with their hands. Before, when you wanted to build something like this; you need to have a deep understanding of electronics, software and mechanics. While we agree there are quite a few solutions on the market today that allow you to learn electronics, there is nothing that will let you learn the other skills you will need as well.It was then we decided that the only way to do this was to design our own platform. This was a tough choice; as we needed something that was easy to use, affordable and compatible with other products on the market today. This was not enough, however it also needs to be strong, something that both children and adults could play with and continue to enjoy for a long time. After a year of testing, designing and several upgrades we finally unveiled our creation. FeaturesMakeblock’s STABILITY comes from its strong modular aluminum design and flexibility. We designed the connections with threaded slots and holes to make connections easier when building, essentially removing the need for bulky connectors. This makes Makeblock extremely adaptable to almost any project you can dream of. Makeblock uses the most popular open source platform Arduino. Just as the Arduino team said, it's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.Moreover, we made MODULARIZED electronic modules with uniform connectors, which is super easy to use and more friendly to beginners. Apart from this, we use color tags to identify the functions of each connector, and with provided Arduino library, you don’t need a deep understanding of electronics to make the right connection, just be sure the color tags match. We believe, you will never find the electronics are so easy-to-use.We will also provide an APP for you to control your robots without programming.A beta version of APP for Android  device has been finished by Makeblock, by which you can use your smart phone control the car through bluetooth. The app has the function of moving the car forward, backward, left, right, and stop. Besides, we are working on the more friendly UI. APP for iOS is also in planning. Once your project is assembled Makeblock doesn't stop there, it is COMPATIBLE with other devices. This means you could add ordinary DC motors, stepper motors and servos to really make your project come to life. Makeblock will also allow you to combine Lego NXT mindstorm into the project. Makeblock is OPENSOURCE (CC-BY-SA 3.0.), all of our design materials, including CAD drawing of mechanical parts, schematics and PCB layout can be download on our website after the funding ends.  Where can Makeblock be used? Makeblock can be used for raising kids' good capablitity of practice. It is suggested parents accompanied.Makeblock can be a great tool for Hackerspace.Makeblock can be used for the education of Engineering, like Model System Construction.Makeblock can be used for the enterprise employee training of team work, time managment, and expanding mind.Makeblock can be used for many practical applications, 3D printer, Camera slider, CNC machine, home automation, and more than you can imagine. What kits should you choose?Price of the kits are ONLY for KickStarter within 40 days, you will never get such low price after this project.For each kit, we will provide detailed manuals and demo code for you, and you can also email us any questions you have.we listed the main features for each kit below the kit pictures, there is also a main part list of each kit if you need more detailed information.How will the Kickstarter funds be used? 

The goal of our first Kickstarter is to raise enough fund to add new components and designs into production, which will give our platform more functions. By pledging to this project you are helping us provide a full range of solutions, to make more ideas around the world come into reality. 

Manufacture plan

We are located in Shenzhen, China and cooperated with lots of factories around here.

For most of the parts we promised, we have already successfully made the small production run. To start mass production the only limitation is whether there's enough fund. So we will make it happen after this project reach 100% funding goal. 

The testing of customized servo prototype has been done. The molds are ready, we will start a small production after we reach 100% funding goal. 

The tank track’s prototype testing has been done as well. We will start to manufacture the mold, and this will take about one week time, and then mass production can be initiated. 

For the stepper motor bracket, we just finished the design, and will test it after our project launched on Kickstarter. The whole process will take about 3 weeks before we put it into mass production.

For the electronics, we have finished most of the promised electronic modules designing and the prototype testing,except the Lego bridges. We will cooperate with local experienced manufacturing companies to do the production.Who we areMakeblock was founded on October 2011 by Jasen in Shenzhen, China. Jasen is a robot fanatic who was not satisfied with the robot kits existing in the market, so he has always been thinking of how to make a better one. But he had no inspiration until one day at his job in a Chinese factory he saw a truly unique design of an aluminum extruded functional threaded slot. It was near the floor in the corner of a large Chinese make frame for holding electronics. This is where it all started. Jasen knew this was the perfect foundation for the robot kit he wanted.Jasen met Tully in the Shenzhen hacker-space in October 2011, Tully is not a stranger of China. He first started working and living in China in late 2005. He has a lengthy career in Open hardware. Tully has added his own touch of creativity to the Makeblock design set working as an engineering marketing advisor, ensuring that it has appeal not only to the east but also to people in the west. 

Andy, supply chain manager, is in charge of the manufacturing and sourcing, he needs to negotiate with about 9 factories cooperating with us. This is a rough task, but he does a great job.

Steve worked in a very big open hardware leading manufacturer for 3 years before he joined in Makeblock in August 2012. He is now in charge of the electronic design.

Robotor is a robot enthusiast and developer with solid background in electronic & A.I. robotics. He met Jasen at a small workshop held by Makeblock in September this year. Now he works with Makeblock as product engineer.

I ordered on the last day if I remeber correctly. The color is a bit off on some of the parts, here and there one finds some remains from the mechanical process, nothing I would mind or complain about. It looks otherwise like a presize work. The aluminum parts are light and feel sturdy. This will be an awesome base for our schools roboter project. Realy happy guy here!~Just received my Ultimate kit in the UK - didn't get any shipping notification or tracking info first so keep watching for that delivery van!~Got my kit today (Sweden). Everything works fine! Quality is really good! Made a IR controlled car as a test project! Had some problems attaching the arduino board though, still not really sure how to attach that the correct way.~I received my photography kit today! I live in The Netherlands and I'm happy to report that everything looks fine. And for once I did not have to pay additional custom fees... :-)~@Asakky: I've had the same concerns. I was also wondering there isn't a more obvious confirmation.@Evaristo: Thank you for your information. Now I can sleep a little bit better, until my package will arrive ;)~If you click ""your response"" for the pledge level you selected the popup window will show you the information you sent them.~Hi, this might be obvious but since it isn't clear what exactly is going to happen ... When sending out the tracking numbers to backers upon arrival of the shipment in the US warehouse, please also confirm the shipping address that will be used.~Hello, I'm trying to contact you to upgrade my shipping so that it includes tracking and makes it through customs smoothly.  Please let me know how I can do this to make sure I get my order.~Any update on USA shipping?  According to the last update it should have shipped already.  Can you provide details please?  Thank you.~OK, it is well past the March 15th estimate, please post some new news. Starting to get a but worried.~When you are ready to ship, you may want to take a picture for posterity.  I imagine that it will be an impressive stack. Just a thought.~Got an automated e-mail from Kickstarter on February 25 asking for my shipping address and color choice. I assume others have also. Will Makeblock be sending a confirmation e-mail upon shipment with a tracking number? I put in a request for a tracking number in the comment section of the survey, but no acknowledgement so far if this would be done (either by default or on request).~Its been a month since last update.  How about a new one?~Same question as Mark below.. The 15th is this week - still on target to ship this week, Makeblock?~Hi, are you still on target to ship March 15 to the USA backers?~Never mind, I figured it out.  Operator error.~I received the email this morning asking for my mailing address, I think I screwed it up.  Is there a way to double check what I entered in?  Getting excited to try it all out.~Thank you Makeblock for keeping up to date with the dates of 15th for US and for the out of US date. it has assured me not to worry and has explained your attempts you are making to fulfill our pledge rewards.~@creator MakeblockWhat is the update so far? will my reward Estimated delivery: Feb 2013Add $25 to ship outside the US be shipping in February? or March?with respect and consideration,Michael~are the generic Arduino iOS apps able to work or does it have to be make block specific?~you should not release in the igs format because that is for techies it should be pdf to reach the most customers regardless of technical expert ease or barriers.~Ai this very moment, when the campaign reached the end, I am stepping into Jasen's office in Shenzhen and I'm very happy to be the the first to shake his hand and congratulate for this great success and amazing project!~5 minutes to go!~@David, have a look at the FreeSoC [1] project, another Kickstarter funded arduino compatible board, with an amazingly powerful and configurable system on a chip that gives you a lot more ports so you can control say more motors and use more sensors. You can preorder from [2].~@David I think it gives a good mix of outputs and inputs as a beginner to intermediate kit, to me the most important part of these kits are the aluminum pieces.~Your board controller seems very limited to number of motors/servos can be connected to it~Just backed you guys, and I'm so excited to start building my robot!~just added $35 for the lego bridges in addition to my Ultimate KitCan't wait to start building~@Laurie I am pretty sure we will see a delay, as it takes time for the funds to be released by appropriate parties.~Can you tell me if we will really receive our kits in January or will there be a delay?  I am anxiously awaiting the arrival to try out some ideas.  Thanks. L.~@Makerblock You said in an earlier reply ""we will release the 3D models after the funding"". Can they be available in Sketchup format please?~@all I previously asked: Which backing levels will be able to make the drawing bot?The answer I received was: ""The hacker-space kit is enough to build a drawing robot""~this is like an erector set for real projects.~Which backing levels will be able to make the drawing bot?~What about a iphone app to control the robot?~What lego bridges come with the kits?~Are you aware of http://openstructures.net? It would be nice to better align both systems. OpenStructures defines a 40mm x 40mm grid, so beams and plates with 5 units or any multiple of 5 would fit. So far only the 160mm beam seems to align with OpenStructures. OpenStructures is mainly designed for larger structures but also domestic appliances such as http://blog.openstructures.net/pages/os-waterboiler-by-jesse-howard~Could you relates the content in each pledge/kit comparing to your already existing kits?These kit seen here:http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/robotics-robot-kits-c-170_172.html…About new electronics, what are the enhancements comparing with the current ""Electronic Advanced Kit for Makeblock"" ?Foundable here: http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/electronic-advanced-kit-for-makeblock-p-1208.html…~I see that both the end of the campaign and delivery times are in January. Is this going to be a realistic shipping date or should we expect to receive our packages later?~Any chance of a option without any electronics? Got lots of stepper & servo motors. Got a bunch of spare microcontrols. Got tons of sensors..~Some ball joints would be interesting to play with.  I'm hoping to be able to make a small vertical lift for the gripper, to grab mail from the box.~Could a ballhead be added to a kit?~Very happily just backed you guys, the kit is exactly what I've been looking for for a few years now. Will you have individual parts available for sale in the future?

As a team competing in the FIRST Competition FRC, we get many exciting opportunities, such as:
Did you catch that? This year, we have qualified for the World Championship! We are among the top 10% of FRC teams across the world that will get to compete at this event, held in St. Louis in April.
Our team has very little funding to pay for the costs of this event, including new parts for the robot and a hefty registration fee of $5,000. With airfare, transportation, and hotel our trip will cost $26,000 to send 10 students and two chaperons to the Championships.

175," Scout, a nearly eight foot long carbon fiber boat, is slated to begin its transatlantic journey to Sanlucar de Barrameda, Spain in the beginning of June. Designed and built by four friends, Scout has significant navigation capabilities as well as robust systems enabling it to travel on its journey completely autonomously. The goal of this project is to send an autonomous boat across the Atlantic Ocean. If successful, it will be the first such craft to do so. The closest publicized attempt was that of the Pinta- a sailboat which traveled 400 miles on its journey before it stopped transmitting its position.Scout’s hull is a foam core covered with carbon fiber. The electronics are, for the most part, assembled and working, the microcontrollers are programmed and ready to go. The power system has yet to be completed with the addition of solar panels and batteries. Care is being taken in designing and programming these systems as they will have to endure the roughest of conditions for weeks on end without human intervention.The electronic systems on Scout are straightforward but advanced. The onboard batteries are capable of running all of Scout’s systems at full power for at least twenty five hours. Satellite tracking is provided by a SPOT tracker and powered by enough lithium batteries to transmit for a number of months. It'll be trackable on our website.If the boat temporarily loses the GPS fix, it will trigger software that uses an onboard digital compass and data previously collected from the GPS to approximate its position. The keel has even been designed to shed seaweed and other debris that would slow the boat. The forethought that has gone into these systems is significant and we look forward to testing them as the project moves along.Costs have been accumulating and for us to complete this project and send it on its journey, we'll need to raise about two thousand and five hundred dollars. With this money, we'll be able to cover the costs of this groundbreaking project and put more of our focus on the project itself.We're more than just a team of friends working towards a common goal- we are making use of some fantastic resources available to us including world famous marine engineers and designers, offshore sailors and navigators, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, and the resources of our respective colleges.Scout is a very exciting, very ambitious project that we have made significant progress on so far. We have reached the point where we can affirm that it will be fully capable of what we have set out to do. We need supporters, both big and small, to support the construction of Scout; a boat that may be the first ever surface vessel to cross the Atlantic Ocean without any outside assistance.Make sure to visit the website at www.GoTransat.com",Dylan Rodriguez,"$3,424",Unstated,"""Scout"" is a robotic boat designed to cross the Atlantic Ocean and reach Spain- a small boat on a big journey.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,73 ," Love the idea, it sounds like fun and I love your guy's passion for it.  I can tell you could really make this work.  I do have some questions I'd like to see answers for before I fund the project (if even partially).  What kind of media attention are you seeking and will you seek on launch day?OK, so I understand from your website that there is no plan in place to deal with an entity which may wish to intervene with the path of this boat.  What about if it is stolen?  How will you know, and be able to retrieve it?  Why aren't you going to video record the boats progress like the guy did who put a weather baloon into space?Isn't it illegal to put a craft in the ocean that may or may not cause a naval collision?Aren't you going to test this first on a smaller body of water?When do you plan to launch?How are you going to retrieve the boat?

176," Greetings! We're Romotive, a team of nerds building the world's first robot for everyone.We came to Kickstarter last fall to make the robots we always dreamed of when we were kids. And thanks to you, we DID. We spent 4 crazy months constructing 2,000 Romos by hand. The first 100 went out before Christmas, in boxes stuffed with candy canes. The next 1,900 went out in batches as we learned how to build them here in our apartment in Las Vegas.But as we were building your Romos, we kept obsessing over how we could make the robot even better. We listened to your feedback and we went back to the drawing board.We wanted to make Romo smarter, faster, and easier to use. Since then, we've put together a team of brilliant nerds and worked our butts off to build you a new robot.  Together we redesigned the robot from the circuitboard up. That was the easy part. Then we set up our production line in China. That was the HARD part. But more on how to set up manufacturing later...After months of wrangling a production development schedule and working through design, material, logistics, supply chain, and testing issues, we hit tool start and began to test prototype robots. Here are 3 actual robots that came off the production line during our EP1 (engineering prototype 1) phase.We're super proud of our all new robot.This next-gen Romo is *almost* everything a personal robot should be. He’s cute, responsive, and really fast, but he’s still not capable of doing all that stuff you see in the movies.That’s why we’re back on Kickstarter.HOW YOU CAN HELPNow that we’ve got a bigger/faster/stronger robot, we need your help to develop software that will make him even better.We've created great basic apps for Romo, and he's super fun to play with. But we have a bigger vision. We want to create really advanced software that lets Romo do the things robots do in the movies.Right now, there’s no wallet-friendly, backpack-sized consumer robot on the market that does these things:We want to change that, and we need your support. Your pledge funds the development of these features, which we'll release in updated apps. We'll also wrap an SDK around each of these functions so other developers can create their own apps and share them with you.WHAT YOU GETWith a pledge of $150, you will be one of the first to receive a brand new, next generation Romo. You're our beta testers. Tell us what you think of features we've toiled over like the all new tilt mechanism.WHAT YOU NEED TO GET GOINGRomo is a BYOD robot (bring your own devices). We've made him easy to operate using a wide variety of iDevices.Dock any one of these babies on your mobile robotic base:Drive your Romo using one of the following: We're back on Kickstarter because we want to put our robot into the hands of hackers, creatives, and robot nerds before anyone else. This robot is your sandbox. Together we can make the robot-for-everyone dream a reality. FAQs:Q: You keep calling Romo a ""he."" Is this robot a boy? A: Yes. Our new robot progeny is male. However, we plan a female version of Romo next, code name ""Julia."" Q: Your first robot supported Android, but this one says ""iDevice."" What's the deal?A: We asked our engineering team if they would support Android again and they ran screaming. No seriously, it was taking us a ton of time to support various Android platforms, so we decided to focus on Apple devices for initial development. There are Android devotees among us though, so plans are in the works. Q: Does this Romo work with an iPhone 5?A: Yep, well, sort of. Our new Romo can be controlled by an iPhone 5 running our app - but use an older device with the 30 pin dock connector on the robotic base. We're designing the next robot to use the new Lightning connector as a docking station. Check on our website for a complete list of iDevice combos that work.We did this for a few reasons. First, cause we're still testing the Lightning connector with our robot. Second, because supply is constrained for production-capacity orders, and third, most of our users will take 3-6 months to buy their new iPhones.Plus, we heard most of you want to put an older device on the robot and keep your new iPhone in your hot little hands. Q: Why come back to Kickstarter?A: Easy. Kickstarter is home. It's where we launched, and where you saved us from a fate worse than death - one potential investor's recommendation that we pivot out of smartphone robotics and into laser-controlled robot light shows. You told us you loved Romo, and there's no better place, with no better people, to figure out how to build a robot with advanced functions packed into a beautiful, easy to use robot for everyone. Q: Your Romo Rebooted tier says ""The Classic."" Does that mean you're giving me the older robot instead of a new one?! WTH?!A: Nope, sorry about that one, we just meant it's 'the classic' Kickstarter tier - pledge one amount, get  one awesome reward in the form of one small, new robot. Special thanks to: Patricia Buck and family (Congrats Trish and Patrick!), Tony Hsieh, Principal Diana Albiston, Technology Specialist Lois Holman, and the kids in Mrs. Berger's Fourth Grade Class at Hollingsworth Elementary, Brian Canning of Swiss Bank Account, Daniel Clark for the sick cuts, Matt Franks for wicked ID, the great staff at the Ogden (we love you Gary, Brian and Paul!!), Jennifer and the crew at the Beat coffeeshop, artiste extraordinaire Leticia Maldonado, the tourists on Fremont Street who gave Romo some love, Phu, Keller, Peter, Romo, AND ALL OF YOU for giving us dream jobs. Directed by: Jimmy Collins, Giant Slice Productions (a very patient man)Soundtrack:  I’m Never Alone by Swiss Bank Account, 70s Satin/A Life Like You by Swiss Bank Account, Attaboy (Instrumental) by You Say France and I Whistle.

Nice packaging, with that ""new Romo smell"".~I haven't gotten it to move at all.  When I first opened the box, I downloaded the app to my Iphone 4s, and my latest gen Ipad.  I plugged the Iphone in, and was prompted to open the app.  At first the app on the Ipad crashed as soon as it connected with the Romo.  I charged it for a few hours, and  I was able to change faces, and see video feed from the Romo, but couldn't get it to move.  I then charged the battery completely, and attempted it again.  I was unable to get the Romo to move, and also lost video feed (just showed black), and the ability to change the expressions.  I reset the settings in the Romo App on the Iphone without any success.  I also removed, and reinstalled the app on both devices.  I restarted both devices multiple times.  I closed all the apps on the Iphone that were running in the background, but still nothing.  After the latest reinstallation on the Ipad, the app crashes as soon as it tries to connect to the Romo.  It has been doing this for the last several times I try to connect them.  Please let me know if this is a defective unit, or if I am missing something.  A forum on the website would be helpful for issues like this.~I received my Romo last Thursday.  I fully charged it and then starting using it.~Romo arrived today !~I waited by the door since valentines day...the new romo finally came yesterday afternoon.  Have given HER lots of exercise.  Somerimes she becomes unresponsive, we shot down apps romo apps on iPhone and controller/ipad and if that didn't work, power cycled both...all was then fine.~I got my Romo yesterday, drove it around the house a bit, but this morning none if the motors are responding.  Just before I out it away for the night one if the motors was jittering a bit on its own.  Is there a way to reset or diagnose such problems?~My Romo (Sheldon) arrived today! Very happy with him! But where can we control him from a browser? Also for those of us who didn't opt in for the hacker pledge when we will be able to get access to the SDK?~I have received my romo today :-)~@Joanna Don't have leh, boonerite~@Boon, msged u on FB...~Romo came in the mail today.  Definately fun to place with.  Can't wait to see what we can do with him once you release the Developer's Program Info to those of us who pledged for the hacker edition.  Thank you for working so hard to make a great out of the box experience.~@joanna Tried to find you to ask some question on FB but there's like so many there. See if you can find me via my nick here~@Romotive@DavidSimmons: I received a red tee, but I made two pledges at different levels (hacker and non-hacker), so I don't know which T-shirt 'edition' this is...~@Boon, I have sent a msg to Romotive team on their FB and here... but no replies from them...~Still waiting for my romo or an email notification.~Where is my romo?~@Parisri nope, still radio silent on email tracking ID and enquiry here~@Arnold A Sitorus: Thank you :)~Sorry, forgot another worst example,One project sent by FedEx for $99 pledge, ending up a total of $76 tax, duty and handling fee!~Addendum. As an example from my experience with one project here. First they sent by UPS, it's arrived in less than a week but I was ended up paying $9 for tax and duty and $16 for 'handling fee'. Second shipment was delivered by USPS (which in my end was handled by my country's post service) was arrived around 5-6 weeks but I just had to pay $0.8. Usually the shipment arrive at recipient country quiet fast but then it would have to go through custom check and appraisal, this can take a very long time. Basically the extra 'handling fee' is to speed up this process.~@ParisriNo, not yet. Not even the shipping notification email. But I wouldn't worry about it. It's normal, I've backed many projects here. This happens. I guess for some countries they just choose a standard international mail which may use our local mail service to avoid extra fee that usually charged by parcel services (eg. FedEx, UPS etc.) on top of regular tax and duty. This shipping method is normally will take more time. In fact it's usually took around 6 weeks to arrive. But the big advantage is that we as the receiver will not have pay more than our country's tax and duty.~@TEO BOON TONG and @Arnold A Sitorus: Do you receive Romo ?~6 days ago, No response from Romotive team.~Still got nothing, including my enquiry via message many days ago. From Singapore like Joanna but got nothing. Not even tracking ID~I think something wrong. I don't receive my Romo. Why don't you send  the tracking number to me ?I waiting for a long time.~Where's my ROMO ?~Yippee.... I have just received my Romo... But where is the Romo passport?  Is it in the Romo box or have you left it out?  Pls advise.~Now I'm curious about the hacker edition tee too.  I got a tee in the mail over the holiday but I am not sure what it was supposed to look like.  It is a dark reddish color with white lettering that says I love robots with a small blue Romotive logo.  Is that the hacker edition tee?  It came along with a small reusable bag and stickers with it.~I've sent emails and post comment regarding Romo passport and FedEx handling fees but got no respond. What should I do to get the answer?I really object to pay the FedEx handling fee that twice the amount of tax and duty fees itself. Can I have other than FedEx or UPS to send my Romo?Please someone from Romotive respond..?~On his way!~Do you ship the ROMO ?Can  I tracking the ROMO ? I live in Thailand. I sent the request mai for Romo passport but no confirmation reply.~Wow... crack his case to examine the insides of Romo?  Poor Romo.....~Was tracking romos shipment... And this appears 'Shipment exception Unacceptable or incompatible Hazardous material'... hopefully this won't delay them any longer and won't happen when u ship them out to all the backers ESP. Overseas.....~Has anyone received their Hacker edition tees? I ordered two Romos and received the ""I Heart Robots"" tee before Christmas (with candy canes!), but not the Hacker one.~Still on track for a January 2013 delivery?~I've sent my request mail for robot passport but no confirmation reply.

Bilibot (from the German word 'bilig', or cheap) aims to address this problem. Using all open source software, Bilibot will consist of:
* the cheapest, most powerful computer we can put together
* a robotic base, like a Roomba, or the iRobot create
* a Kinect sensor
* mounting hardware to put it all together
* the ROS Robotic Operating system, with research contributions from roboticists all over the world!All of this will be bundled together so people can get a robot that does cool stuff right out of the box. The price tag we are aiming for is $400. We're not charging for anything more than parts and the time it took us to assemble it.If you still want to build your own, no problem: all the plans and software used will be made available.We hope that Bilibot can become the Arduino of robotics and allow anyone with a small amount of programming experience to take advantage of the cutting edge technology in the field of robotics. We will further maintain a site at Bilibot.com where developers can share code and discuss hacks.So what is the money for? Well, we have the know-how, we just need to get a stable prototype working - find out what computers work well, what base is the best, and try things out.

180," The aim of this project is to get a robot into every child's hands. There are great robotic kits out there already such as the Lego Mindstorms and mBot kits. However, most of these kits have the following characteristics:Sometimes you want something inexpensive that you can pull out of the box, flick a switch, and start doing simple robotics experiments straightaway. BBot (Braitenberg Bot) is a low cost, extremely easy to use platform that helps spark interest in regards to robotics and STEM. Teachers or parents can easily introduce a fun and engaging activity into the classroom. All you have to do is unpack them and hand out the included worksheets. Students get to drive their own learning easily and affordably.Robotics and associated STEM fields are at the core of an international technology boom, with billions of dollars being poured into the industry. It's estimated 75% of the fastest growing occupations require STEM skills and knowledge [1], and 40% of Australian jobs are at risk of being automated in the next 15 years [2].The education sector is responding, with initiatives such as #codingcounts in Queensland introducing kids to coding and robotics from an early age. For many teachers and schools, the prospect of getting straight into full blown coding and robot construction is a daunting prospect. BBot provides a gentle introduction to robotic technology.BBot is also designed to help students understand the basic of scientific thinking and the scientific method: The scientific method emulates the process of authentic learning.

Authentic learning is where an instructional method involves exploring concepts within a real-world and meaningful context. In authentic learning environments, we hypothesize based on our experiences and current knowledge, and then if a new experience contradicts our generalization we are challenged to alter our hypothesis to include this new knowledge. BBot comes with a set of engaging activities that instructors can use to help bring the scientific method to life! These worksheets are all based on active learning principles, which research has shown to increase deep learning compared to traditional techniques.Why do I need a robot to bring the scientific method to life? Why don't I just use nature, like a plant or an ant colony? Well unfortunately you cannot control all the variables with nature. Mother Nature, while extremely beautiful, unfortunately doesn't always go along with our plans. However with a robot you can ensure that the studies are repeatable and easily focus on the aspects you wish to focus on.There is also another simple reason as to why a robot is a great tool for teaching. Children love technology, especially for many children in developed countries. Technology is just all around them, and because they grow up with it they inherently just know how to use it. BBot uses this to its advantage. To allow students to actively engage, while learning about the scientific process.BBot is based on Braitenberg Vehicles. Where simple behaviours such as 'light seeking' can lead to complex and dynamic movements when multiple stimulus, or multiple robots, are in the environment. The general process within the activities is as follows. So in other words the students mustNow, BBot isn't a one hit wonder. While the activities being developed alongside BBot are all about increasing student engagement in the scientific method, it can be used in several other motivating ways.

The competition is March 7th through 9th, at the George R Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston, TX. Our goal is to compete in (and win) the Lonestar Regional. Our backers and Kickstarters will help us do that! We are in our 5th year as participants in the FIRST Robotics Competitions. It is quite expensive to maintain our team due to competition entry fees, buying robot parts (motors, servos, computers, gears, raw material, etc.), travel and other expenses. The money spent for these items is ultimately used to help us 'build' future scientists, mathematicians and engineers. Our students are learning real-world engineering skills while building the robot. The students are exposed to real-world challenges, such as:   - System Design: understanding requirements, design considerations  - Electrical engineering: circuits, wiring, soldering, etc.  - Computer programming: Labview, HTML  - Mechanical engineering: motors, gears, servos, hardware  - System integration: teamwork, system testing  - Prototyping: 3D modelling, manufacturing, lessons learned, etc.  - Shop Skills: machine tools, table saws, drill presses As you know, these skills are the same type of skills that Makers and Kickstarters LIKE YOU already have. It is our goal that the Gatorzilla students will become tomorrow's innovators! Your Kickstarts will be greatly appreciated.

Just connect yourself to the Botiful market, choose your application and download it. When you pledge for the SDK option, Botiful comes with a complete SDK and allows you to develop extensions for your Botiful :I have been working on
Botiful for several years. The Botiful robots I use in my video are fully working prototypes. The software is also fully
developed. Thanks to your help, the next step is the manufacturing ! Let's team up to launch the first affordable video conference robot !Q. Is my Android phone compatible with Botiful ?  the robot by itself should be compatible with most Android phones on the market (already tested phones can be found here). But in order to use the software to control the robot remotely, you need to verify that Skype is working on your Android phone. To do so, download the Skype application from the Android market and try to place a call to one of your friends. Don't forget to do the test with a video call ! Current list of certified devices can be found on the Skype website here, but you can always check with your phone as there is a lot of working phones not certified.Q. How does Botiful hold the phone in place ? Botiful uses a magnet to hold the cell phone. With your Botiful, you will receive a small and ultra thin metallic part. Two options :  either you can fit it on the rear of you cell phone, (this what I did with my Galaxy phone) or buy a protective case ($2 -$4 on Ebay)  and install the metallic part on the case. Q. I would like to use an old Android phone with no front camera ! If you don't mind not seeing the face of the person controlling the robot, you can buy a Flip case and reverse the phone to use the back camera. This is what I did with my old phone on the picture below. Q. How does it charge? Botiful is a USB
peripheral. You can charge it by plugging it to your computer or directly on the
wall charger provided with your Botiful robot.Q. Does Botiful SDK work without Skype? Definitively ! Skype is an ""extra"" feature to control the robot remotely. But Botiful and the SDK are independent from Skype. You can develop a standalone application to control you robot without using Skype.Q. How do I control the Botiful robot of my friend?

It would be nice to have it on www.mybotiful.comGood luck!~As someone that often telecommutes I'd thought about trying to do something similar myself with an old HTC HD2 that had been hacked to run Android.  Realistically though I never would have made the time to do it and now I don't need to.  :-)   Best of luck with the project.  I'll be spreading the good word.  Here is hoping you get the backing you deserve to make it a reality.~Hi Claire,~Hi Claire, what a great project. I put a question under one of your updates, especially regarding sending network packets from a botiful app via WLAN Network (straight socket or webservice) to enable some local actions like switching a lamp. Do you have some facts about that? Sorry that it looks i'm a bit unpatient, but it's because i'm very curious about that thing. Thanks in advance.~I can't wait to get my Botilful!~I develop for and use iOS as well as Andriod (2.3+). With the understanding that limiting the hardware to initially support Android is a way to limit scope.~Most of my friends have iPhones, i'm wondering if you will come up with an iPhone version?  I'm quite sure you will get a lot of additional backers if iphones are supported.~Hi Claire, awesome project. Just backed the Earlybird special... can you please answer if the SDK is also included with this pledge :) I'm really hoping that it is!~Hi Claire,~Finally, a robot that's not just experimental or a toy, but is also useful.~Ordered mine!! just need to buy an android phone now :-)~Excellent!

185,"  Meet iCamPRO FHD, world’s first intelligent home security robot.Unlike any other home security devices, iCamPRO is the first robotic home security camera that can actually see, hear, sense, and track moving objects, all while communicating with you. ""In today's world of clever thieves and Industrial Saboteurs, the iCamPRO will record every movement in perfect detail so you can identify security threats or common thieves and protect your business and family,"" commented by David Rodwell, one of the campaign contributors. *Computer Rendering.  Packaging may differ slightly from the picture.  Included in the box is an adjustable mount.  You can mount it on a flat surface, wall, or ceiling depending on your intended usage.  If you mount it on the ceiling, you can enable the 180° rotate feature in the app settings so you don't get an upside down view.  Shown below is the custom-made brackets for iCamPRO FHD. Its compact design allows you to fit iCamPRO to wall or to ceiling. The bracket is made of high-quality material not only to fit the device well but also small enough to hide the bracket itself.Second, the FHD lens and image sensor gives extremely accurate pixel calculation and therefore a more accurate motion analysis for tracking moving objects.The iCamPRO also features dynamic channel adjustment.  This means that as your WiFi bandwidth increases or decreases the camera will automatically downgrade or upgrade the video quality so that the stream will always be smooth and without any video or audio delay.Below is a shot of our cameras viewing angle of 100° without any distortion in the picture.Here's a shot of one of the competitor's HD cameras inside a small office (notice the strange curvature of their industry standard fish eye lens):This is a quick demo taken from one of our prototypes, make sure to enable the highest quality on the YouTube player.The iCamPRO is the very first affordable camera that can automatically track any moving object. Our algorithms teach the camera to always keep the object in the middle of the viewing area.  When an object begins to move away from the pixels in the middle of the viewing area, the camera will track the object until it's in the middle again.What if 2 people are in the tracking area?The algorithm is designed to follow the first object detected until it stops moving. Basically, the iCamPRO is using the lens and PIR motion sensors to constantly hunt for any moving object.This is from the other side to see how far iCamPRO can track. In the video below, a walking person is over 30 feet (9 meters) away from iCamPRO.Below is a tracking test in a very dimly lit room.  *Please don't mind the motor noise as these are just prototypes.We will have 3 PIR motion sensors placed strategically around the iCamPRO and if one of the sensors is triggered, the camera will turn to face the object, lock in, and begin to track it using the ITS.  Unlike any other home security devices, this innovative design ensures no blind spots or dead zones for intruders to hide, and removes the need to install a multiple camera security system.As you can see by the videos only some of our prototypes have the sensors.  That's because we just recently began testing it, but only after a short while we are sure that you are going to agree that it is a remarkable feature.The iCamPRO FHD employs a high-speed CPU to encode 256-bit encryption, encipher Full HD video, track moving objects, conduct two-way audio, deliver picture alerts, upload recorded video, etcIt communicates with multiple sensors and compares picture frames one-by-one to detect the slightest movement in real time. This is not an easy task as iCamPRO is taking Full HD picture in each frame and grid each frame in many small blocks to compare their changes. .iCamPRO’s multiple sensors are always on, and these sensors work together to continuously feed information to its CPU. They are like scouts detecting heat signature even in the dark!!Traditional security devices' CPUs run at 100 MHz to 200 MHz because they use simple encryption, which does not require a big computation power. For some IP cameras employing a 56-bit encryption, it takes only 399 seconds to hack, which is less than 7 minutes. For 256-bit encryption, it may take a life time to break. Moreover, conventional IP cameras are unlikely to be firmware-upgradeable, meaning that what you buy will always be the same and the functionality will always be limited. For the iCamPRO project, Teams from Google WebRTC offer us help in selecting chipset vendors, and some of the vendors have very powerful quad-core CPUs with running at 1.6 GHz. We try to balance cost and performance to make our products affordable for everyone, and that is why we won the top honor at 2015 CES Best of Innovation Award under ""embedded technology"" category.Our embedded technologies allow us to continue enhancing iCamPRO's algorithm and functions through firmware upgrades. This means that iCamPRO will be continually learning and increasingly smarter.This special piece is only found in high-end cameras.  The reason is because this infrared filter is motorized and switches the lens depending on the lighting.  It improves the night vision in the dark and the contrast during the daytime when the sun is brightest.With an IR-cut filter, you won’t see any purplish color under bright sun light and will be able to see better in the dark.iCamPRO has 8 built-in IR LEDs with a light sensor to trigger them on/off. Our patent-pending technology allows you to turn the IR LED lights ON or OFF from app. This is important as empirical data indicates harmful results if eyes are exposed to IR LED for a long period of time.For aesthetics purpose, we chose to mask these IR LEDs by selecting a special material applied on a custom-made mask yet allowing IR to penetrate the mask when needed.Without an IR LED Mask With IR LED Mask1. http://www.webrtc-solutions.com/topics/webrtc-solutions/articles/389356-amsterdam-based-company-reveals-first-webrtc-wireless-network.htm2. http://blog.peer5.com/webrtc-the-future-of-the-web/3. http://www.webrtcworld.com/topics/webrtc-world/articles/391226-amaryllo-announces-new-camera-line-with-webrtc-functionality.htmBy tapping the phone's messages above, our app will download the push picture alert with time and date on the phone screen. Push Picture with Time and DatePush picture alerts will be kept for 3 days. The old pictures will be automatically deleted.My Camera Page (above)How do I set it up?We plan to have the setup procedure for the iCamPRO the same as our other products. The setup process takes only 1 minute if you know your WiFi password.  Our app will guide you through the steps and with a simple QR code scan, the camera is up and working. Here is the instructional video for the iSensor HD:What kind of WiFi connection speed do I need?Our Cameras have built-in WiFi 802.11 bgn and both downloading and uploading speeds depend on your available bandwidth.For FHD, a minimum bandwidth of 2.0Mbps is recommended.How long can I record video?  World's Best 256-bit Encryption We care about your privacy protection and that is why we employ 256-bit encryption, which is the same level of security as used by NSA, NASA, the Pentagon. With 256 bit encryption and Google's security network, AES permits the use of 256-bit keys. Breaking a symmetric 256-bit key by brute force requires 2128times more computational power than a 128-bit key. 50 supercomputers that could check a billion billion (1018) AES keys per second (if such a device could ever be made) would, in theory, require about 3×1051 years to exhaust the 256-bit key space.And you can rest assured that something like this doesn't happen with our camera's.Can I use it outdoors?Sorry, no :( Most of our our products are not weatherproof.  Weatherproof cameras are easily a couple hundred dollars more than in-house IP cams.The iCamPRO is able to capture outdoor video with great quality thanks to the IR-cut filter, however we do not suggest to put the camera outside.Amaryllo IS planning to introduce an outdoor camera in early 2015.Look for the iSensor HD ""Patio Edition"" to premier at CES in Las Vegas, Jan. 6-9, 2015 Does it have night vision?Of course yo!  with the help of 8 IR LED, the iCamPRO can record FHD quality video in complete darkness.The above room is PITCH BLACK, by the way.We have a well-rounded team of engineers and support peeps that are more than willing to hear any comments, questions, or feedback that you may have for us.  Don't hesitate to let us know.Website Support: http://www.amaryllo.eu/icam/index_support1_20140822A_test.phpYoutube channel for instructional videos:support.ai@amaryllo.euOur experienced sales team is always willing to explore any new opportunities that approach.  If you have a question or just want to get in touch with us, we're always willing to chat.Email inquiries to: sales.ai@amaryllo.eu iCamPRO FHD wins 2015 CES Best of Innovation Award!!http://www.cesweb.org/Events-Programs/InnovationAmaryllo International has just received one of the most prestigous awards given by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), producer of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the world's largest electronics show that takes place every year in Las Vegas, Nevada.There are two tiers to the Innovation awards given by the CEA at CES.  The first is ""Honoree"".  Over 100 products were chosen as an honoree from 28 different product categories.However, only the products that score the highest, AND above the required score, are awarded the ""Best of Innovation"".  This year 20 products were able to acheive the required score and receive this highest honor.iCamPRO was chosen for the Best of Innovation award in the category of ""Embedded Technology"", beating out major companies like Samsung, Qualcomm, and Nvidia.We welcome you to come share the enjoyment with us at the official awards ceremony on January 4th  or at the show January 6-9 at CES in Las Vegas.  The iCamPRO will be on display at the Best of Innovation Awards Showcase, located in the Sands Expo at CES Tech West.

This year? Next year maybe? Anything?~@creator, do you have any plans to support daylight savings time for the cameras?  The hours are always off during non daylight savings hours.~Stefan my cams have firmware 3.6.2 but the email Ray sent me with a link to DL it  and ~I recently was told to download a file via Dropbox which I assume has firmware 3.6.3 since it had 3.6.3 in the link, is there a new firmware soon to be released to everyone?~$200 down the toilet~I'm never getting this cam. For all of you who did get it, good luck.~How to review whatever camera recorded? Have to take out sd card?~oth my cameras were working fine, all would get notifications and follow anything in its path but now one of my cams will not send notifications but the other one will, mind you they're both set the same and I have tried rebooting the one with the issue to fix it but no luck. I recently updated my iOS to 9.2.1 so not sure if that's the issue as before the update the camera was working. Has their been issues like this from the latest iOS update? Also when the other camera senses sound and movement the notifications are not immediate as when I first got them. Will there be a fix for this or possible to get a new pair and return the bad as my warranty I believe is still valid since I got these cameras December of 2015?~Hi Stefan,What happened to my issue regarding my shipment that we are discussing back and forth since Nov. I am really losing my patience as we are completing 6 months and I've received absolutely nothing!!!~The camera is very noisey when it move.The IR mode is very bad.~@Jacob Hanks I'm going to apologize for my language only because you addresses that you understand why I am mad. It's not about the money. At this point I don't care if I get the cam or not. I've already purchased other products. If I get it that would be honorable. But I'm frustrated most because I have backed other products on indigogo as well and you have left such a bad experience that I am now concerned about everything else I backed. Needless to say. I won't be doing this ever again. Good luck with your business.~Can you please tell me when I can expect my Second-Run EARLY WHITE iCamPRO FHD? You continue to state an estimated delivery of May 2015. It is now February 2016.  Thank you.~Hello Cristhian Gomez~The USB port problem is a hardware, not software. Seems like my kit wasn't tested in quality control. When I have to put a wedge under the USB connector at a very specific angle, then to have it dislodge when the camera rotates... The problem is obvious.~@Jay Deep Kadian. Not everyone has gotten a product that's a 100% as u can read in the comment. What if I pay and its damaged. I can't trust this company to do business with again if they can't even get their shipping done right.~@Jay Deep Kadian. Not saying it's a scam it's worse. We made a pledge gave our money. We shouldn't have to give a penny more. I don't care if they were asking a dollar more. If this would of been said long time ago maybe. But they make me wait this long and now they tell me I need to give more money to get what I paid for they can go fuck themselves.~@Chris , I was in a same situation. Paid $27.00 got my camera, very happy with it. Not a scam.~Dear Chris,~Just an update, I received my camera back in August. I guess I was one of the super lucky ones that didn't need to wait that long. Anyways, I've been using the camera religiously for 7 months now and I have to say I'm impressed. The quality of the camera is great, i've had no glitches or issues since  I started using  it. The tracking technology has only gotten better. Before when I first started using the camera it almost seemed like the camera would follow you after you've already left the area. Now its a lot faster and more accurate. I like that the app keeps getting updated (Please please update to a better UI!!! Landscape only is weird and no material design kind of sucks). ~How can this product win an award at CES 2015 when the USB port is faulty and it doesn't connect to the WiFi network?~Received my camera and it has a faulty USB port that drops out randomly... I have to put something under the cable at exactly the right position otherwise it looses power.I tried connecting and it reads the code, can't connect.Continuing the Kickstarter tradition of giving hundreds of dollars in return for junk.At least I have a memory card for my car camera..~Going out with tomorrow' s trash.~Great. Looks like I basically paid to back a 16gb memory card, because that is the only thing that works. My camera worked for maybe 2 days and now it's useless. Contacted tech support and now I have to pay to have it shipped to Taiwan and mostly likely pay for repairs. Brilliant.~@Creator Jacob ~I think the IR cut on my unit is defect after the latest update  coz  if i set on daytime  everything is pinkish .  i have contacted with support they ask me for the picture  i sent them and still no reply.( contacted guy named Ray).It a shame it worked fine  but after the new firmware update it reacted slower ( both front and back sensor on ) i mean if the camera face the opposite side  on the old firmware it detect immediately and turn around but now after the update  you need to walk closer or wave around before it turn around and check on you  and this mechanical IR Cut problem . i hope you  guys will solved this problem asap. sorry to contact you using this instead of support mail. i guess this is much faster to get a reply~Thanks guys!!!~Please give us REAL geofencing rather than IFTTT. Their servers are terrible and unreliable. I don't want to have my home broken into while I'm away without any security footage because IFTTT thought I was still at home severs hours after I left.~Please stop sending me emails about your other campaigns. You must be stupid to think I would back anything from you ever again when I haven even received the first one. I have already given up on ever getting from you I have opted out from getting emails from you so it better not happen again.~Thanks for the quick reply @Stefan. I just received the cameras over the weekend and set both of them up in about 20 minutes. The app worked on both my Android phone and my wife's Apple phone. Amazing. I'm still playing with them, but I have to say that I'm pretty impressed so far.

186," We are the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics 
(KIPR).  We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit company that engages in STEM 
education outreach through robotics. KIPR operates the popular Botball Educational Robotics Program, an autonomous robotics competition for middle and high school students.Project Kovan is an easy to use and powerful linux-based robot controller.  It aims to be simple enough for a middle schooler, powerful enough for a researcher, and versatile enough for the hobbyist.After playing with many of the other controllers on the market, we felt that they were all lacking something.  We wanted a controller to be easy to use on the surface, but have the raw power to handle anything thrown at it.  The new controller uses a touch screen, but still has a physical button.  It uses a blazing fast Spartan-6 FPGA in conjunction with an ARM processor to handle tasks.  It uses a Lithium Polymer battery to provide long run times and short recharge times.  It is built on OpenEmbedded Linux, so it is very versatile, and already supports multiple languages and OpenCV for complex vision tracking.  The best part is that you do not need a computer to program the controller! Of course, if you want to develop software on your laptop, it can be quickly downloaded to the robot controller by wifi or USB cable. Project Kovan can also control an iRobot Create or AR Parrot Drone, as seen in the video!Because the controller is running linux, it is the computer.  With USB input, the User Interface can be controlled with a mouse and keyboard.  The HDMI output allows viewing on most monitors or TVs!  Using the built in editor allows you to program the controller, then use it, all without plugging it into a computer!Mass: 295 gramsThe native programming environment is KISS IDE.  KISS IDE and project Kovan support the C, C++, Java and Python languages.  The plugin architecture of KISS IDE allows for additional robot interfaces and compilers.  All of the code is based on Qt/C++ and is open source. Command line utilities are also provided for those who wish to use no IDE or integrate with another.We have several prototypes that are up and running.  We are confident that we can deliver the controller as advertised (and maybe a little better).  With your support, we'd like to place the first large order and continue developing software for the controller.We have a finalized board that we have been using for internal testing and software development. Our manufacturer is only waiting for the number of boards to produce. Once the boards have been manufactured, they will be shipped to us for assembly and final testing. We also have suppliers for the other components of the product, including battery, touch screen, case, and other miscellaneous components.

It seems that to sell fuel there is a huge amount of regulations and testing required, and i don't see myself using 5 gallons of fuel a day. Please let us know of any resources you know to help us look into these issues~The closest large bodies of water for me are Lake Ontario & Lake Erie. The US/Canada border goes through both lakes around the midline. AFAIK the lakes are governed by a separate treaty with separate environmental regulations. If this page is still up for a while then I can report back here what I find.~How many days worth of fuel can the system store, and how do you access it if it is out at sea?  Does it autonomously come to land, or do you have to take a boat out to it?~One thing that had struck me while looking over the designs with my perhaps untrained eye especially with the land based unit is the thermal depolymerization aspect and the process of converting sun/wind>electricity>heat and the inherent losses that seemed to spur the old offgridder's adage of 'never use electricity to make heat'.  Have you looked at the possibility of a solar concentrator/furnace for the production of the heat?  I'm just pondering about alot of our areas that don't have alot of wind available~I am a new kickstarter. heard about kickstarter a wile back and was interested, but at the time none of the projects really grabbed me. Really cool to have such an interesting and useful project to be my first kick. Now if you please, go remake the whole liquid fuel industry, as you see fit. I expect great things from you.~Fantastic project.  I hope you do revolutionize DIY biofuels.  Does the water-based robot need to move or could it be tethered?~Excellent project just waiting for your official release~What is the output of the land based version vs. the sea robot?  Do you anticipate any recurring maintenance issues with either version?  Does the fuel need to go through any processes after production (once it has been offloaded) to make it ready to use for biodiesel applications?~here's an article about new commercial competition http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/01/technology-to-efficiently-convert.htmlI posted there about this project~do you have resources where we can learn more about the components in this system , specifically the thermal polymerization of the algae?~Just wondering if you have any designs of the land based system drawn up?~I worry at how the robot can enforce International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea?Especially rule 5 : Every vessel must at all times keep a proper look-out by sight (day shape or lights by eyes or visual aids), hearing ...~(and the central location is a robot too)~I was more thinking:  Algae growing equipment would be cheap but the conversion equipment would be the more expensive stuff. So if you could get one central location that could serve all of the cheap ones.~The last time I grew spirulina it was recommended to compost the dead organisms and replenish the nutrients a la miracle grow, but that was for food, not oil.~Could you split the robot up so that many grow the algae and take it in turns to visit a processing plant to turn into the biofuel?~roughly 5gal/day @26' x 14' =>  594.3 gal/day-acre => 216,914.3 gal/annum-acre~Yep, I agree with thingstodo - This project is plausible and the $$ is low - You should consider offering more diverse incentives as pre-selling one or two of these units would be enough to pay for your goal.~I noticed that the projects that have met and exceeded their targets have a number of pledge levels, with different items for each level.~",0.0,"$2,000",Biofuel for Everyone by Rudolph Behrens — Kickstarter
190," FIRST TEAM 271, THE MECHANICAL MARAUDERS is based out of Bay Shore High School on the south shore of Long Island. Each year our team has six weeks to design and build a robot to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition. From January- Mid February our team of students works with mentors in various technical and non-technical fields to accomplish this goal.  Afterwards, we compete at both the Long Island Regional and New York City Regional competitions in the FRC division of FIRST Robotics. Our team consists of approximately 50 students from grades 9-12, and aim to promote careers in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.Recently, our team has experienced a massive growth in numbers. Your contribution would help us to better accommodate these students in our currently under-equipped shop at the school by helping to purchase new machines, tools, and materials for use in the construction of our robot, and more importantly, to facilitate better education for the students in our community.FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a worldwide robotics competition started by inventor Dean Kamen, with the goal of increasing interest in the STEM fields. FIRST has programs for students of all ages, starting in elementary school. FIRST Team 271 is part of the FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition), which encompasses more than 3,100 teams worldwide. Overall, the program involves more than 71,000 students, more than 87% percent of whom report increased self-confidence and interest in STEM.Our team teaches students a variety of skills, including:Design Skills - Prior to build season, our mentors and veteran team members teach new teammates design skills.  Students learn how to use comprehensive, industry standard design programs such as AutoCAD and Solidworks. Using these skills, students engineer robots to compete in the year's game. Mentorship teaches responsibility and is vital to success. Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Skills - Our robots use micro-controllers, sensors, and other advanced systems to operate smoothly and efficiently.  Every year, students use proper wiring techniques to connect the many parts of the electrical subsystem on the robot.  Then, our programming team writes, tests, and debugs the code that runs the control system.Public Relations - Throughout the year our team promotes a devotion to science and engineering through demonstrations ranging from local schools to day camps, inspiring all ages to engage in the field.  At competitions, our team of scouter/strategists must communicate with other teams in order to win matches and secure a spot in the playoffs.Thanks to your contributions last year, we were successful in constructing the robot in an orderly fashion and were able to not only win the quality award twice this past season and were finalists at each competition.  ",FIRST Robotics Team 271,"$3,055",Unstated,"The Bay Shore Robotics Team provides students the opportunity to learn about mechanical, electrical and computer engineering.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,36 , Good Luck!

192," Last summer, I was teaching robotics and programming concepts to my 8 year old, and realized how hard it is!Robotics innately needs programming, but it's difficult to hold the attention of young minds on abstract tasks of programming.So we started on a journey to create a tool that will teach both these concepts in tandem. And here it is: BombiniBot!Our goal is to make it affordable for all schools and parents to teach robotics to students. BombiniBot is a cost effective way to do it.Younger students, in third through fifth grade, can start by using Scratch to program their BombiniBots. Scratch is a programming language that makes it easy for kids to create your own interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art. Many schools are already teaching students Computer Programming using Scratch. We used BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks) to extend the Scratch ""palette"" with new ""blocks"" that work similarly to other Scratch blocks.Older students can progress on to more powerful minibloq graphical environment.Advanced students can use C/C++ in Arduino IDE to program the same BombiniBots. The BombiniBot is designed for usability at home and in classrooms. For convenience, it allows for on-board charging batteries. For versatility, it has wireless communication with your PC (or Mac). For precision it has encoders on motors.BombiniBots are designed using an Arduino compatible microcontroller, so it makes it easy for students to understand and extend its capabilities as needed.The BombiniBot is simple to assemble and easy to add extensions. It has I2C port to add more sensors.Computers give students a way to ""construct, hypothesize, explore, experiment, evaluate, and draw conclusions"" (Seymour Papert) Robotics does all that and takes it a step further.  It makes programming come to life for kids;  something they can see, touch, and feel.  It's a little like the difference between making a movie and putting on a play.  The benefits of robotics are: Based on backers feedback, we included integration with LEGO pieces ... Below is our new chassis, (new design is also more ergonomic for little hands ...)Last couple of days we were quiet on the kickstarter project but busy with the bot!The new design is even more 'children friendly', the top control board of bot is clear of all components. Only the required connectors, LED and power switch are on top. The back is designed for easy grip by small hands.

193," The Solar-Breeze revolutionizes pool cleaning in a smart, simple and sustainable way.

Pools collect leaves, dust, pollen and other debris all day long. Debris typically floats for 3-4 hours before it decays and sinks to the bottom. By then, it has already produced the bacteria that feeds the growth of algae in your pool. So why wait for all that debris to sink?  Using advanced robotics, the Solar-Breeze intelligently navigates your pool removing dirt and debris from the surface - before that debris has a chance to produce bacteria and sink to the bottom.""Absolutely perfect. Life was a nightmare with leaves, pollen and stuff in the pool. I would be cleaning the pool every hour. I put this guy in the pool, it is tether-less and solar powered so you have nothing to worry about. Just empty it out every week and boom. I didn't have to clean the pool all summer."" -MMIThe Solar-Breeze NX is an innovative and sustainable solution to pool maintenance. It's the future of pool care.Did you know that one swimming pool in America outputs the same amount of pollution yearly as an SUV? That pool pump usage, resulting in 4.5 Mega Watts of energy a year, is very costly and not environmentally friendly. With traditional pool cleaning systems, you don’t have the option of running the pump fewer hours because the pool is only being cleaned when the pump is running.The Solar-Breeze NX is NOT dependent on grid-energy.  Unlike other pool cleaning systems, it is completely
un-plugged, with no cords or hoses, and works whether the pool pump is running or not. Using free solar energy, the robot continuously cleans the surface of the pool all day long. During this time, excess energy is stored in a rechargeable lithium ion battery, powering the unit well into the 
night. A rear paddle powers
the unit through the water, while a front paddle scoops the surface debris into a collection chamber. It
filters the water through an ultra-fine nylon mesh, preventing 90-95% of dust and debris from re-entering your pool. Powered bumper wheels on the front corners of the Solar-Breeze NX rotate and re-direct the unit each time it connects with the pool wall.The Solar-Breeze NX can also distribute sanitizer from its built-in dispenser while it cleans the surface of your
pool, helping to keep your pool hygienic and ready-to-swim.With the Solar-Breeze NX, your pool is always swim-ready. It operates autonomously - no installation, 

hoses, or pumps required. Simply slide it into your pool and turn it on.  It operates independently all day 

long, keeping your pool surface sparkling clean.  The Solar-Breeze NX is NOT remote-controlled.  It is self-

directed, intelligent and reactive.  No electricity or manual intervention is required.Pool owners across America and internationally love our robot. We want to make sure we can get the next generation of our robot in the ""waters"" of many more pool owners, with the larger mission to take 16 million swimming pools worldwide as far off-grid as possible.  Why Kickstarter?We've already been very successful with the previous version of the Solar-Breeze, and yet we still need your help!  We have spent the last year re-engineering some of our components and how they work together. To launch the Solar-Breeze NX we need capital to pay for new manufacturing tooling and to meet the minimum order quantities for our suppliers.  Your support will help us bring this next generation pool cleaner to life.Specialized Robotics

The unit needs to operate in all sizes and shapes of pools.  Many have ladders, water features, steps, 

and other places which could trap a surface cleaning robot.  Sensors and software allow the robot to 

know when it is no longer making forward progress and instructs it to backup and turn slightly to extract 

itself.  While it is backing up, the front paddlewheel continues to turn forward slowly to keep debris 

from escaping from the collection area.  There is also a programmed back-up cycle to ensure that the 

robot covers the entire surface of the pool every 2 hours.  

Recent software improvements include a Hunt-for-Sun program and modifications to reduce the 

amount of power drawn by the motors so that the rechargeable battery can accumulate a larger charge 

and operate longer into the night.  The PC Board has been redesigned for greater energy efficiency and 

to accommodate other connected applications as they are developed. Specifications - Two 12-watt solar panels- Brushless, high-efficiency motors with lifespan > 30,000 hours- 5300mAh 7.4V lithium ion rechargeable battery  - Chemical dispenser tray accommodates two 3-inch trichlor tablets  - Exterior dimensions (inches) 20 X 23 X 6  - Weight (dry and unboxed) – 10 lbs  - Maximum running time per day mid-summer in sunbelt states 23.5 hours  - Collection Area Capacity – twice that of your in-wall skimmer basketOur TeamThe Solar Pool Technologies team is dedicated to bringing solar powered and eco-friendly pool cleaning 

and maintenance solutions to the market.Inspiring innovation:  Our COO and Solar Breeze co-inventor, Denis Ruzsa, has over 25 years of 

experience in engineering, research and development. Over the years, he has designed and built a solar 

air conditioner, water heating systems and pool heating systems.  He has brought a number of 

inventions to market including the Solar-Breeze. Commitment to sustainability:  Our CEO, Paul Sim is a veteran business executive who is passionate 

about finding sustainable products for the pool and bringing them to market.  Paul has a deep 

background in manufacturing and sales and has worked on new product introductions in a number of 

industries.  Ready to deliver:  Our team has already manufactured the first generation of the Solar-Breeze product 

and delivered it to more than 5,000 pool owners worldwide.  We’ve spent over a year working on the 

new components and with our manufacturers before coming to Kickstarter.  We are ready to deliver the 

next generation Solar-Breeze.Our mission at Solar Pool Technologies Inc. is to introduce the products and innovations that make pool maintenance easier, keep the pool sparkling clean and that remove swimming pools from the electrical grid.
 The first, and arguably most important, in our line of products is the Solar-Breeze since it certainly makes maintaining the pool WAY easier, keeps it swim-ready and can take the pool halfway or more off-grid.  
We have 3 more innovations planned for the Solar-Breeze itself.  These are:
-	A removable handle to make it easier to remove the unit from the pool without having to kneel down.
-	An embedded tracking device in case your Solar-Breeze is stolen.
-	Water chemistry testing features that you can access remotely from your smart phone

My old solar breeze is completely done. Its going into the trashcan.~I am a bit nervous as well as to why you you have not posted a delivery estimate. Please advise to all ASAP. ~I was so excited about getting a new Solar Breeze,, I miss my old one but that's my fault for not taking better care of it. I pledged immediately when I found out new ones were finally coming available , now March is here and the blooms from the oak trees and everything else are floating at the top of my pool water, YES I got very spoiled by my Breeze and now am hoping it won't be much longer until my new one is delivered. I'm not all that excited about getting a credit to the store either but I'll get something or just suck it up! It's just very frustrating not having my new Solar Breeze already delivered and working in the pool ! How much longer am I going to have to wait ?!~I also would like to know when we might expect delivery.  The latest you referenced was late March 2016.  We know with fit testing you might need more time depending on how each component functions.  However we would like a time line on what to expect, when we can expect the product.  As far as the filters, perhaps we could get 3 or more filter units instead of credit for future purchases.  Thanks for your hard work and efforts to make a top-notch product.~I gotta say I'm not impressed with the creator's solution for people who paid for extra filters. We get to pay an extra $20 for nothing. As compensation, we get $30 to buy swag to promote their company. No thanks. You'd have to pay me for that. Their other suggestion is to put the 'credit' toward their extended warranty. Really? You have such confidence in this unreleased product that you think we need extended warranties? Can I get my money back?~@Creator Looking for an Update to Production. this is the last from you on Production. ""Our new tooling is almost complete and testing is on track to be completed by the end of January. Assembly will commence shortly afterwards and we expect the first container-load to arrive in late March 2016, about 1 month later than the original plan. ""  Is this STILL accurate ?

Since you mentioned you are now DELAYED, what is the NEW timeline for Delivery ? i expect MORE updates since you are now delayed. Thanks !~My Solar Breeze frame is breaking.....It is difficult to pick it up and clean out the tray.  I would like my unit ASAP....not sure it will last until March.~@creator Sorry to see you will miss your delivery window. I backed this Project to follow the Design and Build of it. Please provide pictures and more information on the Process and Robot. Please keep updates more timely now that you are telling us Delivery has been PUSHED BACK. this information is easier to take if Backers are more informed and kept in the loop.

Keep up the Good Work !~Time for an update.....~We have 3 more innovations planned for the Solar-Breeze itself. These are:~I'm curious to what kind of warranty there is on the NX and after warranty the availability of parts to repair it.~Sorry - should have mentioned that I did the same thing for another one with the additional filters (under my other account - I couldn't figure out how to order two. Yeah idiot I know. lol)~Hey - I just filled out the survey and noticed that it said ($35 Shipping) but I had included that $35 in my pledge. ($454 + $35) Any idea if I'll be charged for shipping twice?~Also curious as to the former project mentioned...Solar Pool Heater.

You guys can now receive all the funds pledged by your loyal and devoted backers and now start building the greatest pool skimmer in the world!!!!!.................. Now get to work. We can't wait.~I tried to buy one last year too! I'm so glad your kickstart has been successful- can't wait to get a Solar Breeze!!!~Reviews of the current unit from people here in Australia have stated the white plastic top degrades quite substantially in 12 months in the Australian sun and salt and water. Will the NX overcome this?~I can't wait for the SolarBreezeNX.  It's going to save me so much time!  #SolarBreezeNX~It's great to be a part of the project.  Can't wait to get me new solar-breeze in my pool!~SUGGESTION--In addition to a lifting handle (that would reduce stress fractures to the nose of the casing) please consider ""ADD ON RISERS (BUMPERS)"" to prevent the S-B from getting caught beneath the rock ledge of the water feature.  Taping foam padding or pvc pipe does the job but looks ridiculous and is unreliable.~I'm so excited & can't wait to get my Solar Breeze NX!!!!

We did it!!!!!!!~Ahhhh......the sweet smell of chlorinated sucess...~@Robert,  the $908 pledge level comes with two units.~I couldn't figure out how to add a 2nd unit, so I created a 2nd Kickstarter account and pledged for another one via that. Hope that's ok to do!  And now you/we're just $7,000 away!  Sweeeeet!~Just pledged for my second unit. We are so close...hope we reach the goal. I really love my solar breeze and want another one!!!!~...baby steps...~We should be able to hit it. Right now, there is still $33,014 left. If all of us backers who are going to get a solar breeze kicked in to make up the rest, it would only cost all of us around an extra $64. We still have 28 days left, so , no doubt more will be pledged for, therefore costing all of us even less to make up the difference.~We should be able to hit the goal well before 29 days I hope. :)~I agree with Steve cox can locals avoid shipping if we pick up ?~I tried to get one last year when I discovered it was on back order. I spent a miserable summer constantly skimming twigs, leaves, acorns, grasshoppers, and various other debris out of my pool. Here I am again this year experiencing the same annoying issue. I can't take it anymore! If it comes down to a couple thousand dollars I'm gonna buy a few of these and just hold on to them. Lol.~We are so close. We need about another 100 units sold so that we all can get ours. I propose that everyone who can afford a second unit, pledge for a second one and give it as a gift. I will give mine to my elderly neighbor who has a pool. I sure hope we don't fall short by 75 or 50 units.......~Any possibility pickup locally in Phoenix and save on the shipping charge?~The Solar Breeze is one of the best investments I've made.

All you have to do is press a button and SpinX will clean your toilet and seat in just 90 seconds. With SpinX you’ll have a perfectly clean toilet! 1. A robotic arm with a rotating brush cleans the toilet bowl:2. SpinX’s water jets are washing the seat thoroughly, Followed by compressed air drying it perfectly:Gentle-Closing, ""Sittable"" Lid. No matter how hard you try, the gentle-closing lid quietly shuts. In addition, our lid is fully “sittable”, up to 330 pounds.  SpinX has an optional cover. You can choose whether to use it or not. Behind the cover are the sprinklers that clean the seat with soap and water, air pressure outlets that dry the seat and an arm with a brush hidden inside a cell. Before operating SpinX, remove its cover and when it's done working, you can put the cover back and SpinX returns back to it's elegant and luxurious look. You can use your favorite toilet cleaner- liquid or tablets.   The toilet cleaner tablets are simply placed into their tank, automatically providing the perfect amount of soap each time you operate SpinX. Tablets will last for 50 cleaning cicles. You can use your favorite toilet cleaner brand or use SpinX tablets.  Each Spinx's tablet lasts for 15-20 sessions. You can put up to 3 SpinX tablets in a tank, enjoy at least 50 cleaning cycles and have a clean and shiny toilet.SpinX operates on low power consumption (12V). Every 30 cleaning cycles charge the battery in your charging base.   Let's face it: the most hated household chore in the world is toilet cleaning. No one wants to clean the toilet and touch it with his hands... We hate it so much that we avoid doing so whenever it's possible—even though we know we shouldn’t... Every time we clean the toilet (usually more than twice a week) we have to put on gloves, hold our breath, take the brush and begin to squeeze, scrub, rinse and dry...Most of the people will agree that when it comes to cleaning the toilet we must not compromise and be lazy because it is one of the areas that gets dirty on a daily basis, accumulate bacteria and unpleasant odors. In other words, hygiene has to be above all. No one really wants to give up on a clean and fragrant house.   That is why we invented SpinX for 2 years— a single goal: make toilet cleaning automatic, quicker, and more efficient so we have more time for the relevant things in our life. Let's throw the gloves away. cleaning the toilet can be funnier by watching the robot does all the dirty work itself! We want our toilet to shine forever!  SpinX has a very simple installation. Remove your existing lid, place a mounting plate, attach the supply hose of water and toilet cleaner, slide SpinX on and that's it! 10 seconds and you have a clean toilet for ever!  Once the campaign is over you will be able to select an Elongated or a ROUND SpinX.    We truly believe in Kickstarter as a platform, where like-minded entrepreneurs and early adopters bring together innovative, disruptive and sophisticated projects to life. We already supported a dozen projects from other people on Kickstarter on our own. SpinX is a completely new device and needs to be ""understood"" in the first place. Kickstarter connects us with people like us; fact-interested, early-adopting and technology-enthusiastic people. SpinX needs your help to fully come to life. Prototypes and pre-production units were financed by ourselves. But the time has come, that we currently face high upfront expenses regarding tooling, certification, studies and minimum quantity purchases. We strongly believe that we've created a product that many people are craving for, ourselves included.

195," Concussive injuries are a threat to player safety and mental health.  An overwhelming number of player injuries are sustained from player-to-player contact during training and are entirely avoidable.  Our team of four Dartmouth College engineering students, backed by Dartmouth Football head coach Teevens has developed MTT (patent pending), a mobile device with the agility of a real player and the player safety of traditional tackling pads.  With specifications taken from NFL combine scores and a ground-up design approach, we are bringing technology to the sports field in a new generation of training equipment. Our primary focus at this point is the sport of football but with the potential to adapt our design to rugby, lacrosse, soccer and other sports, the possibilities are endless. Our virtual player will allow coaches to target specific skills, reduce player injury, and improve performance in a controlled, game-relevant environment from pee-wee to pro.    The Mobile Tackling Target was initially dreamed of by head varsity football coach of Dartmouth College, Eugene Teevens. As a coach and player, ""Coach T"" saw countless players sidelined by concussive and other injuries related to tackling in practice and games. He believed that a better solution existed between using static tackling dummies and player-on-player tackling practice. A solution that would sharpen players tackling technique, while reducing injuries associated not only with poor tackling form, but tackling itself. Coach T approached the Thayer Engineering School at Dartmouth College with the idea of a tackling ""smarty"" as he dubbed it, in an effort to bring his dream to reality. He presented the idea that a mobile, artificial solution to tackling practice could protect the players he relies on every game day during the season and make them better players.  The idea was immediately taken up by four undergraduate students for their capstone engineering project. With the Coach T as the primary backer for the project, the team set off to assess problems and risks associated with player-to-player contact and develop the ultimate solution. Over the six-month course, the Mobile Tackling Target moved from the drawing board to the football field. In 2014, we presented our idea and development progress to the Lemelson-MIT undergraduate design competition and placed in the final three. 
For the scope of the course, the Mobile Tackling Target was a major success. In a short time frame, we developed the solution and met many of our major goals independently. Specifically, we stayed within our initial budget and created a self-righting and mobile device through iterative prototypes. More importantly, we have established proof-of-concept for our design strategy and are in a position to take our prototype to its next stage: ready for field use. Our team wants more; we know the potential of this application of technology to sports training and know we can make a real impact on the safety of contact sports.  Therefore, we are reaching out to our community for support to continue making progress on our device. The funding goal of this Kickstarter is final part of our entire goal established for this summer. If funded, this project will take our current prototype and redesign and reconstruct it to put it on the Big Green field for the 2015 football season. Funding will primarily be used to purchase components for a more robust and powerful tackling target specifically pertaining to the electrical components like the batteries. Over the summer, a team of two engineers will be working full time on development, in the machine shop and on the field to have a fully functional prototype ready for the fall season and to ensure that your donation directly reduces instances of concussion and increases player safety.
We have established a $10,000 materials budget for the next phase of prototype development as outlined above. This is part of a larger budget that includes marketing, external consulting fees and compensation for man-hours. With the generous support of a donor who has offered to match donations up to $12,500, we were able to reduce the amount we are asking for here. After further private donor commitments, we have settled on a final Kickstarter goal of $5,000, 50% of our materials cost for the current development phase. This final push for funding will be used to specifically cover the power supply development and electrical engineering consultation. We know that with the support of our community in this final fundraising effort, we can make contact sports safer, revolutionize the way sports training is approached, and bring our dream to fruition. ",Elliot Kastner,"$5,000",Unstated,The Mobile Tackling Target is designed to accurately mimic player motion thereby improving tackling performance and reducing injury.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1452620607/botiful-telepresence-robot-for-android?ref=discovery,19 ," Congratulations, so excited to see it move forward!~",0.0,"$5,000",Mobile Tackling Target: A Better Way to Train by Elliot Kastner — Kickstarter

We set our goal at $1000 in order to ensure a successful Kickstarter, but desire more to have a successful season.  Our robot can cost up to $4,000 for parts and supplies, and each competition we register for is an additional $4,000, with a $1,000 fee for a kit of parts at the beginning of the season. We are currently registered for one competition, the Greater Pittsburgh Regional, and if we win, we will go to the FRC World Championship in St. Louis at the end of April. This trip would be another $5,000 in registration, and extra funds would be desired to offset some team members' costs for transportation and accommodations.

197," What was the competition last year: Last year in robotics the theme was about wind turbines. Wind Turbines are a big source of energy in Texas. With that being said we had to learn about the process of transporting components of wind turbines. Then we had to construct wind turbines, while also clearing the way of “prairie chickens”. What is the BEST Competition: In the BEST Competition, each team builds a robot that must complete a certain task. Teams also have to write an engineering handbook that discusses what they accomplished, construct a booth that puts their work on display, and create a presentation for the judges. There are many awards ranging from using the most duct tape, to showing the most team spirit. If a team places 1st or 2nd in the BEST Award, or gets first in the robotic competition, those teams can move onto regionals.This year’s game: This year’s game theme is mining. In this year’s game we have many different tasks that we can complete. Our robot can go into the “mine” and get the stones within, or our robot could repair the mine so that humans can go inside. Description of team: Our team is compiled of 14 boys and 11 girls and this is a big step up of students compared to the last years competition, so we have a lot of work to do but, the extra students will also be very helpful. This team has many experienced students that will teach and guide the newer students and at the same time some veterans of the competition that will guide the team to victory.

199," As part of the FLL World Class program we use our STEM skills to design, build and program a robot. We used the Lego EV3 hardware and software and only Lego pieces to build a robot from scratch. Once it was built we programmed it to complete a number of missions on a predetermined board. We can still make the robot better but would need some extra resources and possibly some help from new mentors like engineers.As part of FIRST Lego League World Class we designed and developed a website that helps kids use their learning style to have fun improving their math, science, and language arts skills. We explain how important knowing your learning style is and even provided a quiz in case you don't know what yours is. Then we categorized fun, free, educational games by learning style in three different subjects; math, science, and language arts. Our website is www.adynamicbrain.comThe Dynamic Brains are made up of eleven 5th graders from Ballentine Elementary School in Fuquay Varina, NC. We are coached by Jen Mahlum and mentored by our AG teacher Sonia Clark. We competed at a regional level in Cary, NC and won the Project Research Award for our website and also advanced to the state competition in Greensboro, NC. Our team did really well presenting our project and explaining how we built and programmed our robot. It didn't perform perfectly but we still were 2nd place overall champions which qualified us to go to the North American Championship in Carlsbad, CA at Legoland.We would like to improve our robot and make our programs better by the time we compete in May. it would be great to build a second robot to see if we can make a better more efficient one but we would need to buy another EV3 and Lego pieces. We would also like to get more marketing materials for our website.

200,"  “How frustrating is it when you buy a product that doesn’t do what you expect it to?Four years ago I purchased 4 cameras to safe guard my home, and one day when I was at work a burgler came into my home to steal my stuff. And guess what?? I couldn’t even retrieve one frame of what happened…The burgler was careful enough to avoid all the cameras viewing range or I clearly didn’t place them where I should have… What a bummer!!!We were thinking, how can that happen!!?? That’s why we invented the iCamPRO Deluxe, the simplest way to safe guard your home. This robotic camera embedded with Artificial Intelligence that will detect faces and automatically track any intruder and make sure that everything that moves when you are out will not go unseen. Furthermore, if like me you like DIY products, you just need a bulb socket to power it on.”iCamPRO Deluxe is always watching over your home, so if something unusual were to take place, it would notify you no matter where you are by sending you a snapshot or a snapvideo (a short video of 11 seconds of the situation within seconds). iCamPRO Deluxe has a built-in face detection algorithm. Once faces are detected, it will send you Face Alerts immediately. iCamPRO Deluxe will ask the intruder to identify himself. If he can't, it will sound the alarm and scare the intruder off. You will then be able to take the appropriate measure to safeguard your home.

 For recorded videos it depends on what quality you want the camera to use. This can easily be changed in the settings menu.

For the live viewing, the camera will automatically select the most appropriate quality based on your WiFi bandwidth availability.  It will also adjust the quality to make sure the connection is stable and has minimal delay.  Yes, there is a paper and digital user manual that helps you through the setup procedures, the answer to all other questions can be found on our support page.

We offer warranty on parts for one year after purchase.Our Cameras have built-in WiFi 802.11 bgn and both downloading and uploading speeds depend on your available bandwidth.For HD, a minimum bandwidth of 1.7Mbps is recommended.We care about your privacy protection and that is why we employ 256-bit encryption, which is the same level of security as used by NSA, NASA, the Pentagon. With 256 bit encryption and Google's security network, AES permits the use of 256-bit keys. Breaking a symmetric 256-bit key by brute force requires 2128 times more computational power than a 128-bit key. 50 supercomputers that could check a billion billion (1018) AES keys per second (if such a device could ever be made) would, in theory, require about 3×1051 years to exhaust the 256-bit key space.And you can rest assured that something like this doesn't happen with our cameras. No, the iCamPRO Deluxe was designed for indoor use only.Yes, for this very reason we created Amaryllo Live.

I should get my unit today (San Diego); I can't stand when companies send units from Asia via post and I have to wait weeks - sometimes even months - to receive them. I can't wait to play with this thing!~Mine should be in by the 19th.  I didn't get a tracking number,I had to go and check my status with the provided link.~Hi, I require an invoice for customs purposes. Can you help me pls~Hi I got confirmation from DHL and i have to pay 81 euros to get this camara. ~Hi Chris , my status is mentioned as confirmed so am I one of the 200odd ones who get the product now ?~So on the April 1st update it said that your shipper would pick up the 263 iCamPro Deluxes and today is April 11th so im guessing theyre leaving overseas then heading to the US for sending out to the 263 backers? I checked and my info says ""confirmed"" so curious on when i will get my tracking number as when i got my iCamPros i never got a tracking number so i am hoping i get one in my email saying i should get it before the end of April.~Will we be getting tracking info ?~I've done the shipping details , Could I get my camera in April?~Nice - we get the upgraded version!!!~Your camera is on touch of modern - will we get our shipment before them?~Wait how in the hell does Steve have cameras already?~Both my cameras were working fine, all would get notifications and follow anything in its path but now one of my cams will not send notifications but the other one will, mind you they're both set the same and I have tried rebooting the one with the issue to fix it but no luck. I recently updated my iOS to 9.2.1 so not sure if that's the issue as before the update the camera was working. Has their been issues like this from the update?~Hi, I have one question regarding the camera. Do I have to switch on that light unit in order to power on the camera? Because my house is under decoration right now, so I can still make some changes if I need to separate the power source~@Creator I am waiting for Nicolas to forward me the payment details of my extra unit order . Please let me know how am I going to make the payment . Hope to save some shipping cost if you able to ship the additional unit together with my 2 ordered units out . Thanks~How about replying to our comments. You have our funds so why not provide support to your backers?~I've noticed having one IcamPro on a ledge inside my bedroom facing outside that when the activity zone engaged it doesn't track moving objects as it did when activity zone was not on my Pros, but yet when I did a test with the cams inside with activity zones on it tracked fine. So could having the cams face a window from the inside facing outside interfere with something?~Hi, I backed the iSensorHD way back and I've found it to be very useful. Will I be able to connect my iCamPro Deluxe right to the same app and still be able to use my existing Google Drive account?~I waited for this type for its more usable for me.~All you have to do is look thru your stationary camera campaign on your first crowd funding - see the complaints - a lot are relatively new. Or do you move on and don't address your past issues - they still post~Hi just went back to your previous campaign and there seems to be quite a few bugs in the previous model - are these the exact same ones on a stick or have you listened to the problems and adjusted them? Before I get another one - just want to know if you worked thru the bugsThanks~@Creator Thinking to put the camera in car porch , is roofed but open air , will it affect the camera function ?~@CreatorIs it possible to encase the robot in a transparent casing ? ~Thank you guys for the reply. I finally found the feature using google drive, had this for a few months and I just found it but at least I found it now and know how to use it. I didn't go through all video but I did try to delete a video and can't delete it from my phone, hope that will be added too despite it may loop and write over, would also be nice to add a feature to flag a video/pic and it won't erase or write over it.~Also when is the NAS coming out and will it work with a MyCloud~So i am guessing that the activity/blockout zones for the CamPro will be out when the CamPro Deluxe is sent to us? Also where is the video tutorial on how to use Google Drive for your recording option. Keep up the good work, love my Pros with the exception of it hearing something and it stays there until i go in and put it back but that will change with activity/blockout zones.~@CreatorWhat is the operation Temperature and humidity the robot operate on ? ~@CreatorDoes this mean that a later firmware update will make the camera ONVIF compatible later?~I have sent you a message with some questions I need answered before the campaign is over or I will need to CANCEL MY PLEDGE. I cannot back something I still have questions about.~do you have a video how to set it up on NAS? I dont really understand that kind of thing..thanks~@CreatorI would also like to know if the camera is ONVIF standard compliant (http://www.onvif.org/)?~@CreatorBTW, if you are just simply using Google Drive/Cloud as your backend architecture, but you have your own Amaryllo login for your front end, does NOT mean you are as secure as Google Drive... Your login architecture maybe siginificantly easier to break than what Google has put into place for Google Drive/Accounts with 2 factor authentication.~@CreatorYou're saying that Amaryllo Cloud is Google Cloud?

203," We enjoy eating delicious, healthy food, but few of us have the energy to cook on a daily basis. We tend to feel tired after working and taking care of our families all day. Nobody likes cleaning up the mess after cooking, and most people simply don’t have the time to read through cookbooks and brush up on their cooking skills. Did you know that every year we spend between 200 to 300 hours cooking at home or waiting in restaurants, just to have a nice, healthy meal? Hiring a private chef to cook our favorite foods can address these issues, but that can be very expensive! Unfortunately this can drive us to unhealthy eating habits like going out for fast food. Do we have another choice?OneCook is a high-tech cooker that gives you great options for streamlining your cooking experience. Create and tailor your favorite recipes based on your feedback from previous meals. You can also log into the OneCook platform remotely through WiFi to explore more recipe programs and see the pre-portioned meals you need. With OneCook, you can cook your own recipes with less effort. Recipes can be shared between machines. You can taste your mom’s or favorite food blogger's recipes by copying their cooking processes directly into the machine. OneCook will have your meal ready anytime you want. It can even show you future meal plan recommendations and cost estimates. With its modern features, OneCook brings more comfort and healthy eating choices to your life, not tomorrow but today! As we received a lot of questions about our device features and meal plans, we decided to put some tables here for a better explanation instead of FAQ.What functions does OneCook have? What cooking process can OneCook do?Does the food taste good by OneCook?Yes, it's the same cooking taste as you cook by yourself. Or, if you are fresh to cooking and learning cooking skills right now, OneCook should do better because all the recipe programs are tested by real chefs. OneCook device is copying the process that a human chef did, so it acts the same way you cook your own food: heat the pot, add different ingredients when necessary, control the temperature, and stir if needed. Plus, OneCook uses fresh ingredients, no left-over taste!What's different between OneCook and other automatic cookers?What's different between OneCook meal plan and other meal subscription services?*The cancellation fee is the number of remained weeks * 4. For example, if you purchase the $99 with a 12-month meal plan, it's 52 weeks. So, if you cancel your plan in the 30th week, there would be 22 weeks remaining, which means 22 * 4 = 88 dollars as your cancellatioin fee. So the total of your device is 99 + 88 = 187 dollars, $112 cheaper than the $299. But if you don't want to buy our meal plan, $299 is the best option, $101 cheaper than future retail price. And, want to know which meal plan is best fit for you? Please check out the FAQ part. Feel free to ask any question to us, we know our cooker and meal plan are a big innovation! Not like a smart watch or a drone that people are already familiar with, sometimes backers could be confused with new inventions. :-)Meet OneCook’s Food Packages To reduce your cooking preparation time, OneCook offers pre-portioned fresh food packages.

""The OneCook is demonstrative of the larger trend toward connecting objects (including appliances and cookware) to the Internet, a technological phenomenon that's commonly referred to as the Internet of Things"" As shown, OneCook uses many advanced systems and technologies to make it useful for almost any cooking needs, but that is not it! Another great benefit is OneCook’s web app that lets you log in using any of your mobile devices like your smart phone, tablet, computer, smart watch, or even your car! Here are some of the cool features you will find useful: Due to our responsibility and some people's curiosity, we decide to shoot a temporary demo video about most of the OneCook's details. This video won't use any internal edition or post production to demonstrate OneCook's real functions and technologies. I'm currently on a business trip to CA, so please forgive me to shoot this video without any preparation in a small hotel room with an unstable cell phone. If anyone wants, please feel free to come to our Boston office or makerspace to see live demos or check out our demos in CES from CNET, Mashable or other media. Thanks a lot!The recommended retail price for OneCook was $400. However, during the crowdfunding and pre-sale period, the prices for the OneCook and OneCook bundles are drastically reduced, as listed below. *Meal plan explanation:Similar to smart phone’s data plan, OneCook offers meal plan if you want. Generally, the more food packages and longer period you purchase from our platform, the lesser cost your device will be. For example an unlocked device is $299 but a 12-month meal plan makes the device cost only $99. We recommend you to use our food packages because they come paired with our ready-to-use recipe programs. It saves your time to shop, chop and prepare food. However this is optional, you can still use your own ingredients. If you select a meal plan, each week you will spend at least $25 on our food packages, which equals to 3-4 one serving meals. Of course, similar to your data plan, you can cancel your meal plan to have an unlocked device anytime you want, as long as you pay the cancellation fee depending on the rest period of your meal plan. Currently we have food package distributors for US eastern coast (CT, DE, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, & DC), and we are working hard on finding more cooperative distributors all across the nation, especially on the western coast, even in other countries. This process mainly depends on how many OneCook users there will be in your local area. The more OneCook users are, the higher priority we have to establish food package distribution channel to your area. For those who purchase the full price OneCook, you won't need to worry about meal plan, but we will still take your area into consideration to establish a better food package service for you as soon as possible! More details of each meal plan can be found in FAQ.**Quality commitment and price insurance:Any pre-order is possible to get full refund if user cancels before shipping or doesn’t recognize our product quality after shipping in 60 days. And, if we could bargain more from our manufacturer with a larger quantity order, every pre-order will get refunded based on how much we can fight for. Our backers are the most valuable people and your money is always yours until you are satisfied with our high quality product. For backers outside the USA, your OneCook device might need extra certification, so there could be an estimated extra six months for shipping.Stretch Goals The TNL team has 6 members, including a marketing manager and five engineers, covering mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, controlling, network developing and AI. Our team owns 5 patents, is invested in by three companies, and receives many local business incubator resources. We have spent 2 years developing OneCook. During this period, we worked hard on feature analysis, systems design, mechanical design, electrical design, user interface design, web app development, AI development, industrial design, manufacture, assembly, and others. Development isn’t easy, and many examples of trial and error finally lead to a successful, functional prototype. Now we are working on its 4th generation, which is the product version. We are finally almost there in getting the product released! Why do we need your support? We want to use the crowdfunding to support the mass production and certification, to expand the market, and to establish more cooperation with the food delivery partners. 

One the one hand, without enough orders, our manufacturers can’t sign a contract with us to make the products. For example, the first prototype of OneCook’s 3rd generation costs about $8,000! And it’s almost all assembled by hand. To lower the cost of machining and assembling to a reasonable line for our potential customers, we need at least 1,000 units per order. 

On the other hand, we would like to build a OneCook community where people can create, share and sell their own secret recipes and ingredients to others. In this way users can enjoy authentic delicious food without hiring a private chef. 

These two aspects call for many people to work together. That’s why we need your supports! Let’s work together to realize the goal! Our team will continue the approach of home robots and smart home appliances. Currently, we are making a plan of building a smart fridge to co-work with OneCook, so that users will be notified what meal could be cooked in the fridge with OneCook and what need to purchase. We also have plans for creating a smart chair with a robot manipulator to co-work with OneCook so that OneCook could bring meals directly to users. A smart beverage maker is another cool thing we could create for OneCook users. We would like to let OneCook's early backers to vote for the next product they prefer after they start to use OneCook. With a better and better community, we can provide uses more advanced products.

Thank you so much!

Will it stay like that?~Hi, I was looking at the menu for the type of food that will be offered, and 90% was asian or Vietnamese. Will there be more italian and american, or even more european options? I think I would go crazy having Chinese food 4 times a week. Also, when ordering food, I am allergic to sesame, so maybe have an option to change the oil when ordering something. Also, does the first payment cover the first month. After the first month do I pay $99 a month plus shipping or just the $99. Sorry for all the questions.~@creatorI did back on the hope you will have a provider for the California and southwest areas. Looking at the delivery centers the other meal plan providers use, it's not that many based on the areas and the improvents in shipping methods in the US. I'm not sure how it works in other countries. We choose our meals early in the week, or multiple weeks, and FedEx drops them off on Wednesday afternoon. We have the three meal plan, so 6 plates. I would hope we would be able to do the same type of plan. The option of sharing recipes would also be great.~Thanks for the reply. Are any of the recipes available for review? I'm curious if the sauces in the meal plan packs are mixed sauces or if they are simple sauces(like would be purchased from a store). So if I start to provide my own ingredients, things like meat and veggies are easy but if I have to make sauce mixtures from 4+ different parts it might be easier to just buy a premade batch, especially if I could do it with the meal plan weekly minimum.~I am very excited about the one cook, but am concerned about it being funded on Kickstarter. What is the plan if it can't be successfully funded here? Where could we buy it?~What is the delivery range for your food suppliers? We currently use Plated. From their FAQ;~Oh and another question, can onecook be used to cook with ingredients other than the purchased food packages? Or is it possible to put in the material of our own?~Just backed this project and I have two main questions: 1. Why is the shipping fee so high up? It seems crazy to pay the same price as the product for shipping cost. 2. Would the be food packet distributor in Melbourne, AU?~Can you provde a bit more info on the food plans. I see that it's $25/week, but is that 5 single serving meals? Also I believe it mentioned coming prepacked in the dispensing tray, is that right or how does that work? I'm looking at this as a great item to cook lunch while at work, since I normally spend about $10 per lunch everyday~Hi guys. This is a very cool product. It seems complete enough to actually be useful, rather than just taking over one part of coming but needing attention and help along the way anyway. I have a few questions though please ;What is the maximum power consumption of the device? What is the maximum and minimum temperature of the heating element? Mainly the minimum temperature is interesting because this could double up as a 'sous vide' cooker, which works be very cool. How cold can the cooling element get, and how efficient is it? Could this be used as a mini fridge on days when it is not used for cooking? What is the total maximum volume/capacity of the ingredient modules and also the cooking pot? I want to estimate how much food I can cook on one go. This is not for me currently because I am in the UK, but how do your meal baskets work? Do they get refilled, collected, recycled every time? They look like they are made of very thick, high quality plastics and are a relatively complicated component to manufacture for single use, so I really hope they aren't made to be thrown away... Anyway I think that is all for now! Good luck and thank you! I look forward to your answers! :-)~Oh I see its about 25 a week. Nevermind.~I also am a little confused about meal prices. Could that be addressed?~Can you name who you consider to be your current and near future competitors? Well done on the website and marketing video btw~I began a serious lifestyle change as far as eating last month and look forward to the machine and the plan.~@CreatorJust curious can this machine make fried egg .. Like sunny side up egg ?~@Creator Do have a few questions on this project 1) If I dont subscript to the meal plan , can I prepare my own ingredient for one cook to do the cooking ? ~I have a question about the delivery service. I backed for one with the meal delivery service. I live in the north west part of California and you said that you aren't set up with a food delivery company on the west coast yet. What happens if you can't get a west coast distributor?  Will I get up charged the full cost of the machine, or get my order cancelled?~1. I appreciate your promises. I have worked for one of the 3 food fulfillment companies you have discussed, so I really wanted people to get a full perspective on why they don't want to be a part of anything automated. These company make their money from the experience of cooking, not fast food. You're not a match for them, so until you have an established partnership with them, I would not even mention it because it's far from reality. ~You say that you are going to get Blue Apron, Hello Fresh, Plated, etc. to work with you. Have you ever tried their offerings? They don't prep any of your ingredients. They won't switch their supply chain to do that for you. ~Fantastic..Good stuff guys...I am in then ;)~What a great idea! I've looked at other cookers such as the t-fal air fryer or the Thermomix (which  preps and cooks) but your idea is very promising. I like it that I can prep and then have it automatically cook remotely. I know you are trying to get your distribution up, have you thought of partnering with other fresh food delivery services like blue apron to reach more consumers? Also, do the 20 people who back you as distributors, will they get sole distributorship? And if so, for how long?~Hi,~Hello! I just have a few questions I wanted clarified, please. If I pledge the $99 one, I get the machine but I'm subscribed for a 12month meal plan that cost $25 per week that give me 4 single serving meals, correct? (It says that I can cancel later, but in assuming the fee would be to at least pay $200 for the rest of the machine)But if I do the $299 one, then I get one machine, and no meal plan and I don't have to make any other payments, correct?~What a great invention omg you guy are so smart congrats to the whole team~Hello again I pledged 99usd for the one cook I just wanted to make sure I'm actually getting the OneCook cooking machine~Hi, I was intrested in knowing if I get 2 or more Onecook will there be a discount on shipping?~Hello I just want to know if the app will tell you what you need and you just buy the food and put it in or do u have to buy the pre made food packs?~@Team TNL, Glad to be here.

204," A message from the team:We are First Team 3807 and are Overland High School’s robotics team. Overland High School is an extremely diverse school located in Aurora, Colorado. We have members with different interests and backgrounds with over a third of our team being women and a large range of nationalities represented on our team. Our team was founded in 2010, when a student and physics teacher teamed up to bring robotics to Overland. As a student-led team, we recruit students interested in many fields -- computer science, several fields of engineering, and even fields of business and art/management.Please take a few minutes to look at our end of season video from last year, which is an excellent showcase of who we are:FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is devoted  to helping young people discover and develop a passion for STEM subjects and inspiring teamwork, leadership, and Gracious Professionalism among students. We compete in the annual FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), which requires us to design and build one robot over the span of six weeks. The FRC involves large-scale robots (4 ft tall and 120 lbs). This past season, we were tasked with constructing a robot that could lift and stack plastic totes. The previous year’s robot needed to shoot two-foot exercise balls into tall targets. Every year, the competition is different, although certain aspects are always the same. One such aspect is the alliance system. You are never competing by yourself, as your team is paired with two different teams every match. FIRST does this to promote teamwork and Gracious Professionalism, two concepts that will be key for us to learn before we enter the workforce. As you can see, FIRST teaches more than just robotics.

Each year, we need to build a new robot, which means we need to pay for the parts that cannot be reused. This is not cheap. A robot can cost up to $4,000 which, for a small team of high schoolers, is a lot of money. We are asking for your help in funding this amazing project.
Our pledge tiers are as follows:
$1 - Fund a bolt. Bolts, as tiny and inexpensive as they are, play a critical role in our robot. Without them, we wouldn’t have a robot. For this, we will send you a personalized thank you email for supporting our team.
$5 - Fund the wires. The electrical wiring in our robot is also crucial. Without it, power could not be distributed throughout the robot, and even if we had an amazingly built robot, nothing would work. As a thank you for your pledge we will send you a team pin on top of a personalized thank you email for supporting our team.
$25 - Fund a motor. Motors are essential to any robotics project as they provide movement. Motors can drive anything from the wheels on the robot to an assortment of manipulating mechanisms. As a reward for this, we will send you a thank you email, a team pin, and a personalized dog tag.
$100 - Fund the four wheels. Wheels are one of the simple machines in engineering and in order to let our robot move around the field, we always need at minimum four. Wheels are very important, and as a thank you, you will receive a thank you email, a team pin, a personalized dog tag, your name in our brochure, and a team tshirt.
$200 - Fund the sensors. Robots, as cool as they are, start off quite dumb, so we add a multitude of sensors to help it know more about its current situation. As a thank you for your pledge, you will receive a thank you email, team pin, personalized dog tag, your name in our brochure, and a team sweatshirt.
$500 - Fund a special mechanism. Every year, the task requires some sort of special mechanism, whether it is to fire a frisbee, pick up a giant ball or lift plastic totes. These tasks require complex mechanisms, and can be very expensive to construct. As a thank you, you will receive a thank you email, a team pin, a personalized dog tag, your name in our brochure, a tshirt and a sweatshirt.
$750 - Fund the metal on the robot. Metal is an important component of most robots. We use mostly aluminum, in the forms of special bars call 80-20 and C-channel. These provide the frame for the robot and all of its components. As a thank you, you will receive a thank you email, a team pin, a personalized dog tag, your name in our brochure, a tshirt, a sweatshirt, and your logo or name on our team tshirt.
$1000 - Fund the chassis. The chassis is the most important part of the robot. It provide the framework on which the entire robot is constructed. However, it is not cheap to construct. In return for helping us fund it, you will receive a thank you email, a team pin, a personalized dog tag, you name in our brochure, a tshirt, a sweatshirt, your logo or name on our team tshirt and on our robot, and a visit with the team during build season, or if that is not possible, a video conference.
$3807 - Fund the team! Aside from covering the cost of the robot, team funds go towards competition registration, transportation, food, and many other expenses. Your generous support is greatly appreciated. In return, you will receive all of the rewards above. In addition to this, you and one other person will be invited to be imbedded in our team during competition. You will get to experience the entire competition, from the quick and stressful turnaround between matches to the fun team lunches to the insightful strategy meetings.

206," ATOM is the first security robot that can recognize human faces, talk to people, and auto-track intruders 360-degree even in complete darkness. ATOM can announce hourly clock, i.e., ""It's 2 pm"" and say ""You've got mail"" when new email arrives. When intruders are detected at night, a pair of flash LED light will shoot out to follow them. ATOM is an enhanced robot on Amaryllo's 2015 and 2016 CES Best Innovation Award design. It is what a real intelligent security robot should be. We improved and added more features to the original design such as human face recognition, human-voice event greetings, instant 10-second video alert, alerts timeline access, activity zones, blockout zones, hourly time announcement, Google Services connection, intruder warning light and so on.Shown below is a TRUE incident that a suspect, shown below, broken into a house in Berlin Germany. The suspect was instantly caught and tracked by ATOM. Face Alert was sent to the house owner immediately. From the Face alert, the suspect looked stunned by ATOM's auto-tracking ability and thought the house owner was looking at him, so he ran away immediately without damaging property. The below Face alert was provided to Berlin Police to follow up now.  ATOM sends instant picture or video alerts to you with embedded icons for you to call pre-registered phone numbers or to sound alarm to scare off intruders. See updated demo video here.   Amaryllo robots can detect and recognize human face using company's advanced technologies. They can distinguish human faces from animals’ and they can recognize family members. Amaryllo is developing facial recognition solutions to enable Amaryllo robots to fast recognize family members for smart home security applications. We expect more features and applications to be available based on the new facial recognition technologies. ATOM employs high-speed multi-core CPUs to encode 256-bit encryption, encipher Full HD (1080P) video, track moving persons, conduct real-time two-way talk, deliver picture or video alerts, and upload recorded video, etc. It communicates with multiple sensors and compares video frame by frame to detect the slightest movement or intruders in real time. This is not an easy task as ATOM is taking Full HD (1080P) video in each frame and grid each frame in many small blocks to compare their changes.

 ATOM’s multiple sensors are always on, and these sensors work together to continuously feed information to its CPUs. They are like scouts detecting heat signature even in the dark! Traditional security devices' CPUs run at 100 MHz to 200 MHz only because they use simple encryption, which does not require a big computation power, so the most of security devices employing a 64-bit encryption and they take less than 10 minutes to hack. For 256-bit encryption, it may take a life time to break. Shown below is a traditional auto-tracking system diagram.

 
    ATOM is powered by high-speed multi-core CPUs with a patent-pending auto tracking system (IATS) and smart sensor network (SSN), ATOM is the smallest intelligent security robot that sees, detects, talks, and tracks humans in real-time at your home, office, store, and school even in a dark environment. Our algorithms enable ATOM to always keep the object in the center of the focus.  When an object begins to move away from the center of the focus, ATOM will start to track the object until it's in the center again.With intelligent auto tracking system (IATS) and smart sensor network (SSN), no matter where the intruders appear, ATOM can immediately rotate itself to capture the intruders.  Smart sensor network (SSN) has 3 built-in PIR motion sensors strategically positioned on the ATOM and if any one of these sensors is triggered, the camera will automatically rotate to face the object, lock in, and begin to track it using the IATS. Unlike any other security devices, this innovative design ensures no blind spots or dead zones for intruders to hide, and eliminates the need to install multiple stationary cameras.
Real-time object tracking is an expensive technology that is previously only available in military or professional surveillance systems.  Amaryllo is the first company to realize it with a compact design for your home or office at an affordable price.       ATOM is always watching over your home, so if something unusual were to take place, it would notify you no matter where you are by sending you a snapshot or a video (a short 10 seconds video clip) of the alert situation within seconds. ATOM has a built-in face recognition and detection algorithm. Once faces are detected or recognized, it will send you Face Alerts immediately and sound the alarm to scare off the intruder.  You will then be able to take the appropriate measure to safeguard your home.  ATOM will require you to extend 1-min. intruder alarm or to call 911.  The new Video Alert feature enables all cloud subscription members to receive instant video push messages after detecting human face, abnormal noise, or motion. We rewind the recorded video by 3 seconds so you can see what actually had happened. A 10-second video alert will be sent to all registered family members anywhere, anytime. Amaryllo is the only company offering urgent video alert service.  ATOM can talk and it’s linked with Google server to offer extra communication services. It would say “You’ve got mail” when new email arrives.  Spam email will be filtered and ignored by our server. ATOM can report time every hour.  ATOM will also greets and say “Hello”, “Good Morning”, “Good Afternoon”, etc. when it detects human faces.  Your loved ones can talk with you by ATOM anytime. ATOM has a highly sensitive built-in microphone and speaker to give you two-way talk capability and you are able to hear what is going on around ATOM from your phone. We care about your privacy protection and that is why we employ 256-bit encryption, which is the same level of security as used by NSA, NASA, and the Pentagon.  Breaking a symmetric 256-bit key by brute force requires 2^128 times more computational power than a 128-bit key. 50 supercomputers that could check a 10^18 AES keys per second (if such a device could ever be made) would, in theory, require about 3×10^51 years to exhaust the 256-bit key space.   The Activity Zones will allow you to define what areas you wish to protect. Using the Amaryllo App, you will be able to designate up to 4 zones. With just a touch of your finger, you can designate the zones to watch over your most valuable possessions and ignore the rest of the areas.
The Blockout Zones work the opposite way of the activity zones. You can designate up to 4 zones on your screen to cover the areas that you don't want to be notified for.  If something happens, you can quickly scan through your video recording to find it. ATOM highlights moments when there's human face, motion or sound been detected and shows you what happened in that instant. ATOM offers direct access to internal memory buffer so you can retrieve previous recorded images instantly by simply swipe your finger on your screen to access the recorded files.     ATOM also features dynamic video quality adjustment. This means that as your Wi-Fi bandwidth increases or decreases ATOM will automatically downgrade or upgrade the video quality from 360P, to 480P, to 720P, to 1080P so that the data stream will always be smooth and without video or audio delay. ATOM has 8 built-in IR LEDs with a light sensor to trigger them on/off. Our patent-pending technology allows you to turn the IR LED lights ON or OFF from app. This is important as empirical data indicates harmful results if eyes are exposed to IR LED for a long period of time.
For aesthetics purpose, we chose to mask these IR LEDs by utilizing a special material applied on a custom-made mask yet allowing IR to penetrate the mask when it is needed.ATOM features mechanical IR-cut filter, which will filter out infrared light during the day while allowing it to pass through at night. This IR-cut filter will enhance image clarify for the day and night vision. With an IR-cut filter, you won’t see any purplish color under bright sun light and in the meantime, enables ATOM to see better in the dark. Many low-cost security cameras with night-vision do not have an IR-cut filter and thus result in unfocused images with bad color reproduction in the daylight. ATOM has a 2 Mega pixel (1920 x 1080p) high definition resolution camera to offer precise face detection, auto-tracking over 40 feet (12 meters), 360-degree smart tracking network, and 8 infrared LEDs to offer night vision. ATOM is able to see 360-degree surrounding without blind spots to safeguard your loved ones and possessions even if it is in the complete darkness.  ATOM's 3-level audio sensors cover 360-degree area to extend its audio coverage beyond ATOM’s field of view. You can program ATOM's audio sensitivity to reduce false alarm. ATOM has built-in microphone and speaker to provide users with the ability not only to listen in but also to communicate to people. For instance, if a person is detected in the ATOM’s field of view, ATOM will send an audio alert to its owner.  Amaryllo builds world's first dynamic Peer-to-Peer server that monitors communication bandwidth to automatically adjust video format so consumers can enjoy the best streaming video experience. With this novel technology, you can enjoy true two-way talk with your loved ones, pets, colleagues, and customers in real time. ATOM will also say greetings to its owners or intruders when one of its sensors is triggered. ATOM is linked to Google Services to notify you by saying ""You've got mail"" when new mail arrives. Our server hand-shakes with Google Servers every 2 minutes, making sure that you won't miss your important mail.  Amaryllo Services are secure online storage platforms provided by Amaryllo that is accessible from anywhere in the world. With Gold or Platinum Plan, Amaryllo Services offer you 30-day or 365-day rolling continuous recording and 10-second video alerts so you can look back to see what you have missed from any device linked to Amaryllo Services anywhere, anytime. It also uses powerful technology in the local storage to give you different alerts timeline. Your records are stored using 256-bit encryption even if ATOM is stolen. Subscribing to Amaryllo Services, you will receive a push video, snapshot or text alerts when any one of ATOM’s built-in multiple sensors is triggered.  Our app will download the push video or picture alert with time and date and display on the mobile device screen.  Your alert videos and snapshot photos will be kept in Amaryllo’s cloud storage for 3 days.Amaryllo offer free firmware and app upgrade. ATOM is unlike the most of security devices which can’t be firmware-upgradeable, so you can enjoy the latest new features. Amaryllo App is available for Android and iOS.ATOM comes with an adjustable mount which enable you to mount it on a flat surface, wall, or ceiling depending on your intended usage. If you mount it on the ceiling, you can flip the image using the 180° rotate feature in the app settings so you don't get an upside down view.  
Shown below is a custom-made bracket for ATOM. Its compact design allows you to fit ATOM to wall or to ceiling. The bracket is made of high-quality material not only to fit the device well but also small enough to hide the bracket itself.
We've seen a huge demand for display views from multiple devices on a split screen platform and sharing ATOM recorded images with others.  Amaryllo introduces “Amaryllo Live” where you can view all of your ATOMs simultaneously on a PC browser or share your recorded images of ATOMs with others. The beta version is now available and you can view your ATOMs at: https://live.amaryllo.euTo access Amaryllo Live, you must have Mozilla Firefox web browser which supports Amaryllo Live; however, the other web browser companies have agreed to support Amaryllo Live and WebRTC in the very near future.
Below is a video demo showing how to view with a full screen at Amaryllo Live. You can use the PC browser to move ATOM right, left, up, and down just like what you do with your smart phone. This is super convenient and easy to control.       Amaryllo's Contract Factories  About AmarylloFounded in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and backed by venture partners, Amaryllo is the worldwide pioneer in home security robotics.

And which courier they are using?~I just got a message from TNT about my parcel. On one hand I would have REALLY preferred that standard mail was used, as any courier is not the best option at my end. On the other hand, however, I am glad that the parcel is just around the corner. I shall receive it likely next week.~Got my tracking number and my Atoms are on their way ����~Good news!~Please some updates. It is to quiet :)~Hi team, Can we get an update?How is the shipping of the units going~Did anyone recieved shipping track number?  I think it was planned to be shipped before the end of this month~HiI have just saw an email from u today regarding confirming the shipment through ur website~To add to Steve comment, that would be easy if you could add a tag to the cameras in the app.~Also I would like to see being able to name the cameras a person has in Google Drive and Amaryllo app without having issues as  doing so it won't be troublesome if a person has multiple cameras that they'll be able to see which one they need to look at instead of going through each to finally picking the one they want. Can't wait to get my Atoms��~I have an iCamPro HD. Works great and I'm planning on moving it to another spot for better coverage. I feel that it can easily do everything the atom can do except maybe the facial recognition.~Glad to see you can add the lightbulb accessory to the Atom. Would also love to see is to be able to add multiple blackout/ activity zones as I've done a zone but when I went to the right to add another my first zone I add from the left deleted. Also be nice so we could draw any shape for the blackout/activity zones other than a square. And I second to have a turn ALL cams on or off that a person has but with a little pull down screen with the cams you have connected, that way you can turn all cams on instead of going the way you have to do now.~Hi. Since my amount of cameras from you are steadily increasing I have a question suggestion. Could you implement an ""all-on"" / ""all-off"" button in the app? Switching all of the cameras on when I go to work and switch them all off when I come home is kind of annoying. :-)~I've been using the previous version of the cam and I've love it. Are you planning on updating that one to include some of the features of ATOM there? I've only one of it, so I haven't seen the way you interact with more than one, any pointer on what to do about it. Also wondering if you have any way to have a power pack or batteries for the cam.~@creatorI've seen that one of your products has a E27 thread to be screwed into a lamp socket. Is that accessory also available for ATOM?~Good news!! Thanks!!~I am happy to hear the ATOMS will be shipping out next month (Nov.) instead of December. But I hope there are no bugs to my pair of ATOMS like the Deluxe I am having.~Thanks, that's good news :) ...please keep us informed, silence makes people nervous ;)~@creator - any update ...~Hi there~@creator - HomeKit also in your roadmap ?~Trouble with IFTTT is yet another point of failure in the chain, and the absolute LAST thing you want with a security product! I REALLY hope Vera support is coming as it has a lot of local processing so if there are internet problems, at least the HA system can still arm or disarm the camera without the need to go through 3 different cloud systems, for example.~@creator- hope that you will work with ifttt.Most of the people work with different home smart products (not only Asus - i dont know any from Asus smart product). It will be smart business move, people dont love to focus on one company (asus) , people love to have alot of options, ifttt give us this option.~Is it 220v or 120v?~HUM HUM...I feel like being ignored... Is not a way to atract bakers.~Hi, @creator, great to read you made a deal to work with the products of ASUS smart home. On paper you are a Dutch company, for me it is strange that the ASUS smart home products do not seem to be sold or supported in Holland, Belgique , and also Germany I did not find much. Can you tell me where we can find/buy or see the products in Europe? It would be great to intergrade smoke/Co2/ or other home automation products. ~Hi,I don't find the answer for this question :- will we have picture alert without a premium plan ?- could we use private cloud with atom (without the premium plan) ?- which language are supported now ?- can we use atom without amaryllo account ?~Hi amaryllo~Since the iCamPRO, iCamPRO Deluxe, Atom can take a microSD card up to 32GB I am curious if that could be increased to up to 256GB with a possible software update and if not is it possible to have future cameras have that amount? And also there a way to keep the video preview on all compatible cams without getting a subscription?~Hi @creator. First of all, IFTTT intergration would bij a very big +, many of my home automation and weather station works with this. ~@creator - thanks, let us know!~@creator! After alot of comparisons i finally decided to go with your product. One of my dilemmas was that you not do ifttt integration Hope you will change your thinking with that. For the private home user - its so so comfortable and easy!Also, it moving 180 degrees, it can move also up and down?~Sorry, one thing more :Does the cam is compatible with generic cam app?~Aisle = avaible~Hi, very good projects.~",0.0,"$1,000","ATOM, First Intelligent Security Robot That Recognizes Faces by Amaryllo International — Kickstarter"
207," CLASS is a great platform  to help students be more comfortable with how they learn in a classroom. Our Periodic Table Of Learning Methods helps people to identify their learning style and corresponding learning methods. Additionally the Spin Wheel we have created displays these learning styles and methods in a easy to understand format. Together our solution improves the learning experience for students in a classroom environment! We are team 480 Nano Ninjas, an all girls, 7-membered team, consisting of 6th and 7th graders. Our Project Question for the 2014-15 World Class Challenge is “How do we improve the learning experience for students in a classroom environment?”. After several months of brainstorming and research we came up with our solution CLASS, or Crowdsourced Learning Academic Scholastic System, based off of our Periodic Table of Learning Methods and Spinner of Learning Methods. Our team began our research with the brain. We discovered that there were two main divisions, or hemispheres. The right hemisphere controlled creativity,artisticness, and deeper emotions, while the left brain controls your more logical and mathematical aspects. We further learned that the brain was further subdivided into more parts called “lobes”, which is how we came across the different lobes connected with the different learning styles. For example, the occipital lobe is connected with visual processing, and therefore the visual learning style. We were really interested with these learning styles so we conducted more research and looked into the Dunn & Dunn model, particularly in the Physiological Domain and the Perceptual Element. Here we found the four main learning styles: visual, aural, kinesthetic, and tactile (VAKT), although this could be then be expanded into the 7 we used (visual, physical, logical, verbal, aural, social, and solitary). Our Project Solution, CLASS (Crowdsourced Learning Academic Scholastic System), is an online platform where contributors such as professors, scholars, teachers, and other trustable sources translate lesson plans into different learning styles. The teacher can then choose his/her needed lesson plan according to the grade, skill, and task for the students and send it to the students through a private network.The students can use their mobile device, computer, iPad etc. to view the lesson plan in their most comfortable learning style using the CLASS application. All the applications are managed by the teacher with the same classroom code so he or she has control over what assignments and lessons are given to the students.  For the contributors of CLASS to know what methods to use for each learning style we have created a Periodic Table of Learning Methods where we have grouped over 100 learning methods according to their learning style, in a similar format as to Dr. Dmitri Mendeleev the inventor of the Periodic Table of Elements in 1869. We also sorted the learning methods by their complexity and popularity. For the students to know what learning style they are most comfortable with we have created a Spinner of Learning Methods, which is a tool that uses the most common learning methods in each learning style and displays it for students to either find which learning style they should use according to the current methods they use or vise versa.
